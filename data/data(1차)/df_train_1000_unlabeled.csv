friendly people. Great place to grocery shop!,2
This place is in A class by itself. Can't compare with anything else in the valley. It's Awsome. Great food. Clean restrooms. Not to crowded.,2
"Nam Khao Thod and the Tom Kha is definitely a must try in here. Coming from Asia myself, I must say this is definitely one if the best and authentic Thai food I have ever had. I am so thankful to the friends who introduced us to this place. It has become our go to everytime we are down in Vegas.",2
Rude and unwilling to correct mistakes. The delivery guy was nice but dont bother asking for your sauces for the dishes you ordered. It's one thing to make a mistake that happens. It's another thing to deny it and then fail to correct. I'll never have to argue with the woman in the phone that is in charge again.,1
"The fondue style is kind of fun and the service is outstanding. The food it's self was not real exciting. The ""Cheddar Cheese "" fondue was no where near cheese I'm not sure what it was. My husband and his buddy had one drink and then were cut off. Our friend is a little loud and flamboyant so maybe they thought he was drunk. Anyway, it was kind of a bummer for my birthday. The place is ultra quiet. Maybe it's supposed to be romantic, but I think it would great for families and kids.",1
"I usually loveeee Chipotle's and I order the bowl but this time I decided to order 3 tacos w flour shell, this was awful, they didnt wrap it individually it was all in one big foil, by the time it was time to eat them it looked like one big nasty mess, and wet from the steak meat, I had to throw it away after a couple bites, maybe the young teenage workers do not put much thought on the product since they are only there for gas and movies money right? oh well.",1
"So, we went to ride up to a near by resto to pick up a friend after work, 3 doors down , and decided to stay in the area for some food and a few drinks for it was a beautiful Sunday in the summer of montreal. And that does not last long so one has to take advantage of such situations. Just one humble man's opinion, and for the record, i randomly met this man, and found out that he was not that humble. Anyways, it has a proper setup, and an aesthetically pleasing feel. And having been involved in rest's that is such an important tool for your business. Inside was on point along with the the terraces, and yes, they have two, one smoking, well, i should not have to name the other. Best dish that was brought to the table was a lamb burger with goat cheese and of course normal burger garnishing and was ""fantastic "", NOT SURE IT WAS WORTH 18, but was very good. The server was really nice and accommodating, for example, upon the delivery of the desert, some ice cream, the runner presented a bowl with one tiny scoop in it which was 3. When she quickly appeared to check on satisfaction 'i guess', more likely what is about to happen happens every time this is ordered from the menu, i said, ""well, i ordered a 3 bowl of ice cream and they brought me a bowl with a small scoop of butter in it "", BUT WITH A SMILE, i do recognize she is not in charge of portions and serving sizes. But she got a huge laugh, and took it and brought it back with a two more scoops. So a 1 a scoop, A WIN WIN, for all parties involved. Two more scoops for a good laugh. All in all, had a great time, and will definitely go back. The only drawback was they kept bringing us menu's literally one after another, with no acceptable cadence to menu delivery. With all the menus in front of me i thought i was a student at the library writing a research paper when most of them did not apply for the time of the visit. BUT, i must say, if you are in the area on a wonderful day, definitely, ""make it happen ""!.side note, they have the best looking iced coffee i have ever seen, and i don't even drink coffee!",2
"As far as revitalizations go, it is nice, but I wish that they had done more than make it a suburban strip center paired with an exurban cluster of parking lots. Isn't the entire point of Urban Revitalization to bring in a more pedestrian friendly atmosphere? I always thought it was. It is not about creating more sprawl. n nYes, the new Boxes that have been plopped down are nice due to the context within but this is far from something to sings odes of joy about. We don't need any more glorified, ""luxury "" strip centers. I agree with Jean K's assessment of the situation entirely. This design was just plopped in place and the only local flavor is the bridge that was present. Where is the thought? Where is the design? We can see this Anywhere, USA. n nHaving said that, though, I will return because the Waterfront does house certain big box retailers that you can't find in Pittsburgh Proper. I really wish they had created a less suburban scheme and more contextual and conceptual design.",1
Had a 6 00 pm reservation and let them know that I was attending an 8 00 pm concert in the hotel. Service was terrible. We didn't receive our salads and soups until 6 55 and our entrees didn't come until 7 35. The steaks came rare which is not what was ordered and the shrimp was way overcooked. This place is way too expensive for such crappy service and food.,1
HORRIBLE HOSPITAL! nChecked my mother in for a cough via Emergency room. DR wanted to keep her overnight and staff told us a room was available. SEVEN HOURS LATER they took her up to a room.finally ER stopped waiting on someone to transport her and took her up to the room on her own.THE WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE FOR A A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER!,1
I wish I could give zero stars for the poor service. They made us wait an hour for a table and said the table will be ready in 10 minutes at least 2 times. When talking to manager they said if you can't wait you shouldn't be here. Not a good practice for business and I will make sure not to let anyone ever eat at this establishment.,1
"I gave them a 5 star last time but now I'm taking it back. nTheir moral ethic is the worst of all. They were never clear about the scope of work and just trying to back burn you by leaving a spot here and there to keep you coming back so that they can keep earning your money. I fell for that last time, and I brought my car in again with some new damages, hoping that they can have them ALL fixed. They just played me cuz I'm a returned customer and the fact that I don't know much about cars. We had a deal for 250, I brought it down to 200, paid half and left. Saw them circling my car for a while before that, no one came and tell me anything. 30 mins after I took off they called me, asking for more money and more time saying they misquoted me. That's the way they do business. I was told two times and confirmed that I could have it done by Monday morning, nope, they told me ""you have to bend a little for the work we do "". Almost got fired cuz of the extra time they need without prepping me! Worst of all, they denied they actually said it and said its all on me. And of course, my work isn't completely done cuz ""for that little money you expect all of them done?! "" Lol. RIDICULOUS. I'd rather go to a legit place next time and pay more to have a customer service I deserve instead of having cheap labor and lousy management scammed and fooled me. Don't come to this place, no one deserve to be treated with no respect like this. They still tried to have me go back for extra money to do the details. How hilarious. After we got into a big argument they told me they don't need my business and they were wrong to make me a deal. So it's reasonable to assume that all non major repair work means nothing to them. n nJust don't go to Gio's. Worst experience ever. Good body shops are everywhere and you can find one that provides you with good price and customer service. n nI wish you a close of business soon.",1
"I received WORST service in this place. The manager is very rude. The employee tried to honor a promotion to us without coupon, the manager, Rob called the poor kid to the back and the employee who tried to help us, was back with tears in his eyes. I couldn't see this scenario and told him that he can't be rude, he said the employee did something wrong and he had to be dealt with. Then I said you should be nice to customers just like the employee. He said sir you are pushing it. I called their corporate, and the manager, Rob said you can't be in this building if you are filing complaint about me. I want you out or will call the cops. My children and I were very disappointed. I will never take my children to this particular chuck e cheeses.",1
Living Spaces i thought was going to be an outstanding place to purchase all brand new furniture from sadly i thought about that to soon. n nWe purchased our dining room table from Living Spaces after searching and fell in love with the table and the outstanding service that we received. Well it was time to redo the living room and countless trips to the Scottsdale location to shop around till we found something that we liked. We find the perfect coffee table for us and we purchased it online and had to wait for it to be shipped to Arizona. We picked up our table and arrived home excited to put the table together and get the living room decorated. To our shocked when he box was opened it was a returned and used table. n nThere is nothing wrong with purchasing something used and returned if i am going to be getting a discount for the product. I dont expect to pay 275 for a coffee table to get it home and see that it has been repacked and trying to be sold. We inspected the table to later to find that it was damaged and the pieces were thrown into a ziplock bag. In the box was an envelope from the manufacture that stated no resellable. n nI immediately contact the customer service number since you can not call the store directly. I explained the situation to him and wanted a new table to be delivered to my my home and for them to take this old one away they stated that they needed to open a claim and i would need to send pictures of the damage on the table. The gentleman on the phone would not even tell me that they had more in stock until the claim was completed. n nI sent pictures and received a phone call late the following afternoon stating they they will be getting me a new table but i would have to pay for delivery. After some speaking with the customer service people i finally got them to agree to deliver for free since i was having to wait 1 to 2 weeks for a new table to arrive. n nOne week went by and i had not received a call that a new table was in stock so i reached out to customer service again and got another rude lady on the phone. She said that they are not expecting a ship for another week. I explained that i was rather upset that this company is not trying to do something to ensure that i continue to shop there. I asked to speak to a supervisor in which she immediately stated i dont have one here and then hung up the phone. I went to the store and spoke with the General Manger and him and another team lead worked with me to try and figure everything out. That is the kind of service that you expect when you spending hundred of dollars on stuff for your home. They found out that they were getting a large ship in a week and i stated that i would wait for them to come in. 8 days later i still hadnt received a phone call stating my new table was in stock so i once again reached out to the customer service department and they stated that they were not expecting a ship in for another week. n nAt this point i very upset that i know how to wait until week and on top of it those dates are not even guaranteed so it could be even later for me to receive the table. Once again i asked to speak to a manager and to my shock there wasnt one there. I find it hard to believe that there are new any managers are this call center. n nI then asked if i return the table i have would i received a full refund and her response shocked me to no surprise. You would have to to pay the restocking fee. You have got to be kidding me you expect me to pay a restocking fee for your poor service. I am now having to wait for a manger to call me back so i can figure out what this company is going to do for the struggles that this now causing me. n nNeedless to say if they have the table in stock at the Arizona location make sure that you inspect that product before you leave the store. Do not have them ship the product to you. Also for a company that prides them selves on customer service you have a long way to go before you can do that.,1
"Went here for breakfast brunch with a friend who is vegan. I had the early birdito and she had the classic both made with tofu and a side of eggplant ""bacon "" . Both of us enjoyed our meal and the cute atmosphere of the place. The birdito is a hearty hemp seed chorizo, bell pepper, and onion breakfast wrap with good flavor. I had never had a tofu scramble before, and the difference in texture from eggs was noticeable at first but the taste was wonderful. The entire menu is vegetarian vegan all desserts and pastries are vegan , so it's great for people who follow those kinda of diets. The eggplant ""bacon "" was not what we expected. It was really just cooked sliced eggplant. Good if you like eggplant in general though. Excellent service and delicious coffee with almond milk from a local roaster Xanadu made this an all around great meal. Both of us left happy with our choices, with a tasty dessert for later the gluten free almond butter brownie is great! , and deciding that we needed to return to sample the lunch menu and pie options.",2
"Stumbled across this on yelp while looking for some local thai places for dinner. AMAZING thai food here. Recommend chicken panang curry, garlic rice yum , tom ka soup, beef massaman curry, with the mango sticky rice for dessert. The chicken panang curry and tom ka soup was my favorite. So rich in flavor and the chicken so tender. Delicious! Every item we ordered was good. So if you're looking for some good eats off the strip come here. Why wait an hour at the popular lotus siam next door when you can come here? Great food for reasonable prices and excellent service. They even called a cab for us to get back to our hotel. Highly recommend this little gem. We'll be back.",2
"Where do I begin. well, let me start by saying you don't matter to Mandalay Bay unless you're a 'whale' their term for big time gamblers . If you're here with your family for a vacation and just looking to have fun sorry, even if you can afford it, you're not getting a cabana. You're lucky to even get a chair. They will as they've personally told me physically remove you from a cabana if one of their 'whales' so happens to desire the cabana you're in. It's their policy. They might make up for it by giving you a lawn chair out in the 110 degree heat with no sun protection. you know, where you belong! Equivalent to 'let them eat cake' in my opinion. n nFurthermore, let's say you're like me and you do happen to gamble a lot. Maybe you've even made their second highest status Platinum like me. yeah, that doesn't matter either. In fact, on two separate occasions now it has yet to matter. They say Platinum members are given ""priority cabana reservations "" . What they mean to say is, ""you can call us at a special VIP number only to have someone say 'sorry, get lost' in a little nicer tone "". It's a complete joke. They only care about you if you are losing the kind of money that could run most cities for weeks. n nIf you are spending money on dinners and shows and suites and whatnot. get lost, they don't want your business. If you have a chronic gambling problem and don't mind paying the electric bill for Vegas while you're there. Welcome to Mandalay Bay let me kick this family out of a cabana that they should never have been allowed in in the first place! n nJust as an aside I've only had this experience at MGM properties. The Wynn, The Cosmopolitan The Palms actually apologized to me for the treatment I received from MGM properties. I can tell you honestly they don't treat their guests this way. Nobody should!",1
"Potentially a good, maybe great venue. Overrated in my opinion, with surly doormen, rude bar staff and a really weird mix of clientele. Not what you would expect to be frequenting a live jazz venue. Infact, the majority seemed more interested in chatting loudly, rather than listen to the live music. n nThe Jazz bar could do with a bit of a clean, it is dimly lit, maybe this is the reason why.",1
"My favorite brewery in town, nothing beats it's Orange Blossom Hefe. Definitely a dive but that's the charm. I'm not a huge fan of the big screen for sports viewing and the music can get pretty loud as well as the crowd so I'm usually screaming into my companions ear but the beer food make up for it. The staff is very friendly however they are either extremely attentive like all the waiters seem to come up one right after the other and ask if we need refills or you have to walk up to the bar to get any attention. Food wise they have excellent pizza and sandwiches. I usually order the caprese sandwich or the muffaletta. It can get pretty busy on a weekend night but I will take that over Four Peaks any day! You will be amazed at the selection of beers on tap as well as the large fridge at the back of the bar that is packed with individual bottles and six packs of beer from around the country and the world. I'm getting thirsty as we speak!",2
"Frustrating to pay more for low quality. n nI'm on vacation in a casino. I expect to pay more, but at least for something good. The sandwich I ordered was 10 but used grocery bread and iceberg lettuce. There was no empty tables and the lady at the counter said, ""You can sit at Starbucks. "" I walked over to Starbucks with a tray and a number of people bumped into me and almost knocked over my food. n nDid I mention that the sandwich was not that great? This place was near the west entrance near the convenience store with a Subway. Subway would have been almost 50 of the cost and much better quality.",1
"I was so excited to learn that they had opened up a Lee's Sandwich in the Henderson area! This saves me a LONG JOURNEY Sarcasm to Spring Mountain to get my fix on a Bahn Mi. n nGreat location, easy to find parking and the sandwiches taste just the same as it does at the other location. n nDid you know you can order DOUBLE MEAT and EXTRA VEGGIES on your sandwich? I learned that a couple of months ago and I have been doing it ever since! haha. n nThe only time I had a bad sandwich here was the meat ball sandwich. When I see meat ball sandwich in an Asian joint, I'm thinking and Asian pork meat balsl! Well it was basically a failed attempt at making an Asian version of the American meat ball sub. Total fail! n nI'll just stick to my usual grilled chicken and grilled pork subs from now on. haha.",2
"I love this place. Me and my buddy went and got floats one day. Today im leaving the Phoenix art museum. As im passing it I decide to grab a float. I got orange soda vanilla float. So freaking good. I recommend sitting at the bar. Old school bar stools bolted into the ground. great atmosphere, and you can enjoy a great list part of American culture.",2
"This place is truly hit and miss. The breakfast is best here like many other reviews say here the drive thru is rediculously laid out while I've never encountered rude staff here I gotta say it's only selling point is the location,being 2 stories, and the piano is awesome but it is mcdonalds keep in mind so the food can only be so good even if it's hot and ""fresh "" n nEat here at your own risk and since they close at midnight this isn't a drunk food spot",1
"I am straight up in LOVE with the fried goat cheese balls at radio maria. i was super excited to go and enjoy some of the deliciousness that is the food, however, last week i went in with a friend and we were seated and then literally sat there for 7 minutes before someone came over to us. I was just the hostess, who said that a waiter would be over in a minute. That minute was another 7 minutes, and we didn't even have a drink order in, so we got up to leave as we were super hungry. The hostess shrugged and was totally unapologetic about the terrible service, so we went to jupiter's and had some delicious pizza and beers for 1 4 the price of what we were going to order.",1
"When the temp reached 116 this August, my air conditioner died. I have a home warrantee and they sent out a repair guy two days later! He looked at my air conditioner and refused the job. I had to call the warrantee company back and they were going to make me wait another 2 days! I protested and somehow they found Sysko and Frank worked me into his schedule later that day. He did an excellent job and shows that cares by working late and through the heat of the day to get the job done. I really appreciate the excellent job he did and great customer service he provided. Thank you Sysko Services!",2
"I was so excited when my hubby surprised me by taking me to Gimmie Some Sugar! I've been hearing nothing but great things from my fellow Yelpers about this place. n nI knew when we walked in I wanted a macaroon, but they have several different flavors priced at 4.50 a piece. Gimmie Some Sugar has a pretty good sized menu. They even have pairings with wine and champagne. My husband ordered two cookies one oatmeal raisin and the other was called the ""Monster "" cookie. It basically was ALL the cookies in one! I finally settled on the strawberry and champagne macaroon and an espresso. The macaroon was super sweet, but balanced with the strong espresso it was perfect. Joel's cookies were moist and sweet as well. n nThe decor is very inviting. We stayed and ate at a small table. They also have comfy chairs to lounge in too. It's like a really girlie coffee shop, but with fancy desserts! n nThe staff is friendly, but slow. I felt bad for the girl up front cause a line started after we walked in. She had to go in the back and ask the other girl to come up front to ring people up. I hate to say the second girl was not as friendly as the first. I'm sorry you had your work interrupted, but don't give me a sour puss. n nOverall the desserts are totally worth going for! Maybe with a couple more staff members on the weekend Gimmie Some Sugar could really rock! Can't wait to try all their other tasty treats! It's a great place for a date night or even a treat with your friends.",2
Best value and location for the money. Go for the Rush tower.,2
"Was the spot before I discovered Yogel's, Uswirl, and Yogurtland opened up. The chubby asian dude who works there is an ass. The women workers are friendly. Prices are high, i'm never going to a NON selfserve place again cause they always skimp you on the quantity of yogurt. Fruits are fresh though. Go there if you MUST. But Yogurtland is only 10 mins away.",1
"Sadly, we had a bad experience that last time visiting Picazzo's. I don't think we'll go back. We ordered our favorites, but this time each dish was poorly made.",1
"This is a great place to enjoy a cold brew on the patio, and if you're really thirsty you can drink it by the yard. The noise level is moderate enough that you can easliy catch up with friends and hear what they're saying and you can laugh loud enough that the folks around you won't care. TV monitors are plentiful so you can always catch a glimpse of the game. n nYard House offers good food at a good price, with a respectible beer menu. Bring your friends and enjoy.",2
"Best dive bar ever. Marcelo, the owner, is the coolest bar owner you'll ever meet. His staff is friendly and awesome with their mixology knowledge talking about you, Elizabeth! Great music, super clean environment with this amazing atmosphere. Hard to find, impossible to unfind! Stereo and video equipment is top notch. I dragged my friends here for my birthday and everyone had a blast! Definitely worth the drive if you're looking for a diamond in the rough!",2
"Great work, fair price, nice guy! Will go back everytime!",2
"Overpriced, mediocre, lack of attention to detail and quality. Would not recommend. Don't waste your money.",1
Not a gluten friendly bakery! We called to make sure they have gluten free products on hand. They informed us they even have gluten free croissants. Upon arrival they only had nly GF whoopie pies and cupcakes. We were miss informed and wasted a trip from our hotel on the strip for nothing. They would not even sell us a slice of their gluten free bread. If you are gluten free don't waste your time with this location,1
"They killed my cat. Brought in my 5 year old short hair domestic cat because he was peeing in places other than his litter box and hiding which was unlike him. They said it was normal for cats his age to have a swelling problem which causes pain with urination, and that he would probably have it for the rest of his life. They said it was no big deal and the only thing that could be done was to give him an anti inflammatory and some pain meds until it went away as it would with time. He was better for a couple days but then he started getting worse. I called the vet and they said to give him more of the pain medication. When he still didn't get better I made another appointment, but by then it was too late. The night before his appointment he was swollen, up all night crying in pain, but the emergency hospital didn't have any openings. I took him in the next day and by that point his body was already shutting down. It turns out he actually had a kidney problem, and the pain medicine I was giving him was actually making his kidneys shut down. By that point his temperature was so low, they couldn't bring it back up. I was forced to put him down. Talking with another vet had he not been misdiagnosed, he would not have died. I will never go back to Desert Inn Animal Hospital, and I would not recommend anyone else does. He was family, and I will forever feel guilty for bringing him there and ending his young life",1
This place is ridiculous! Had a table which was paid for in full then theres a random fight by our table which no body from our table was involved in and the idiots they hired as bouncers kicked us out our table form no reason! Will not be back and will let everyone know not to go spend their money here!,1
"These guys fixed an ac unit that has never worked right. My little boys and I are loving life now that it was repaired. I had two previous technicians from other companies over the past year come and troubleshoot and didn't find anything out of the norm, these guys found it in 10 minutes and it works like a new unit now. AMAZING. Thanks so much guys",2
"The pulled pork sandwich was really good. Wife got California chicken sandwich and tomatoe bisque soup which she really enjoyed. We are here for lunch on a Friday and they are very busy. n nAll in all, a good place. They also have a big drink selection. Would be a good place to come for happy hour. They new their own beer and have a huge selection.",2
"I was looking for a quick dinner before heading to bed and sushi sounded great. I was solo so a nice seat at the bar, a little DJ music and great bar service was just the touch. Had two sushi rolls and loved the bartenders recommendation the Lima. Shrimp tempera with crab was amazing. Also had two mojitos, great night. Definitely recommend.",2
"I don't think you should ask your clients if they are getting an eyebrow wax, when they aren't getting one. Which is what happened to me. nMy girlfriend and I tried out Bronze Boutique strictly for the killer deal of a mani pedi offered in the Republic. This place is a glorified tanning salon, and nothing more. nThe pedicure was mediocre and the person who gave it to me, asked me if I was also getting my brows waxed. To which I replied, ""No. Are you saying I need to? "" My girlfriend was also lectured on how long it had been since she'd had her last pedicure she lives in CO.it's not flip flop weather there in January . Also, I didn't think insults were included in the package, but I was wrong. nThe treatments were supposed to be the ""elite "" versions, but if those were elite, I'd hate to see what their regular services entail. The service was pretty lame, and the results were equally as bad. There was no spa treatment about it strictly business and we were in and out as fast as they could do it. The special was 35 for both services and my nails look like it. You get what you pay for, so spend the extra 20 and hit the salon in a strip mall near you.",1
"I have been going here for about a a year and a half now and I love this place. I bought a groupon originally and have been going back with my membership card, best groupon I ever bought. I usually see 'Shay and she is amazing. She applies the right amount of pressure and I love the oils and scents she uses. All of the therapists I have seen have been great. Everyone is always really friendly, they do a great job of creating a relaxing environment. n nThe only slight drawback I have seen is sometimes my 1 hour massage will run a little short. I have been there a few times when the therapist was running a little behind and my appointment started late, which is fine, but it still ended on the hour. n nI will also say they have a very easy and convenient online booking system.",2
"The only good thing about this place is that it's open Saturdays and a very nice dental assistant. Other than that I would not suggest this dental office. My husband and I went in for a dental exam cleaning X rays or so I thought, they just took exams and gave us a list of what was wrong with our teeth and the cost. The receptionist was not easy to talk to , and it was hard to understand her when I asked questions.",1
"TOTAL liars. They act like they have this huge inventory of cars, however they just search the internet and get the car from another dealership. They pay dealership profit and charge you a fee which allows them to take advantage of customers both ways. In this internet world, we should just find the cars we want on our own. They lied to us and will never ever use thier serivce. I have asked to speak with the owner but he is never in the office.",1
"You do not have to be a cyclist or even own a bike to appreciate this bar. n nThis is our favorite new South Side bar. The decor is just awesome while very much in the bike theme, it meshes to create this colorful, welcoming atmosphere. The people working there were pretty awesome themselves too. The menu promotes local cycling organizations even the pint glasses have Venutre Outdoors on them , which isn't so much ""annoying product placement "" as ""lovable community relations. "" These are good people running a good bar, and I hope they stay. n nThe beer selection is amazing. While they only have 6 on tap at a time, if you take a peek behind the bar you will find yourself faced with a hard decision of micro brews, local domestics, and imports. n nHappy hour is from 5 to 7 every Monday through Friday, and it is 1 off Drafts, and a special 3 selection of their appetizers. They have the best little hot pretzels I had ever eaten the Tangled Spokes . n nFor everything under 8 the menu is a little more involved than your standard bar fare, with its inspired hamburgers peanut butter, pickles and cheese? and ahi tuna appetizers. It seems like half of the menu is vegetarian friendly, and it's not just the ""here's a salad "" kind. It's real, good vegetarian meals. You can even substitute their specialty burgers with black bean burgers. They even have a kid's menu! n nWe will be going back. We will be taking friends and family. We would be surprised if we ever go to another South Side bar again.",2
"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! So I purchased a growler of hard cider it was so good I had to go back and get it refilled and purchased a second growler. n nI would recommend this place to every one. The only thing is the the road work on Warm Springs is a joke, so go before rush hours 4 30pm to 6 30pm. n ngreat prices on Wine and specialty Beer and it has all the hard spirits you want!",2
"A disappointment. When we arrived at valet, the staff informed us that valet was full and we had to self park or leave our car with the key inside until more space opens up. So much for first impressions! n nWhen we stayed here in June 2014, we slept in a standard room with 2 queen beds. The room was extremely claustrophobic. The bathroom sink had terrible drainage, and the water pressure from the shower head was pathetic. The only thing going for the Planet Hollywood is its centralized location on the strip. n nWhen we complained to the hotel staff about the poor condition of the bathroom amenities, they were reluctant to accommodate us. After a back and forth telephone tango, they finally offered to waive our resort fee for one night. Big whoop. n nSave your money and time and stay at the Monte Carlo or Flamingo. Both hotels have more spacious rooms that have been recently renovated and touched up. Planet Hollywood is overrated, and leaves you with a feeling of mild dissatisfaction.",1
Very upset today by the poor service received the manager and store clerk who could not locate my order and indirectly stated I must have ordered from the wrong store! Which is incorrect seeing as I had spent over 65 on two cakes two weeks prior. I would have not accepted the cake they all of a sudden found had it not been for a coworkers birthday.,1
closed this is now la canasta.,1
"A strong 4 stars and I'm going to agree with Misti Y on this one. They get a bonus star for devotion and creativity in my world . The food experience overall is satisfying with delicious waffles and a filling smoothie. I dug into the breakfast sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed myself. However, as Misti also mentioned the price seems a bit high for what you are getting. Also, I dunno about you but I usually don't eat potato chips with a breakfast sandwich. They should add hash browns or even tater tots haven't had those in forever to their menu as a side item. n nCute, fun place that I will most likely return to on my next waffle craving.",2
This place has a great vibe and fun atmosphere. The bartender Kyle was great and didn't look flustered once. but it was under staffed for the volume for happy hour. The owner an older gentleman who wandered around the bar like a lost puppy never assisted the staff with anything. He stopped and talked to a few pretty girls while he ignored my credit card that was desperately sticking out of the check presenter for over a half an hour. I will come back just not when it's busy.,2
"To make things short and sweet awesome food! But downside is there is no restroom you have to go to the business next door to use their restroom. Good thing is that it's clean, although there was no towel paper to dry your hands. Also, parking sucks! There are a very few of stalls. Maybe drive thru is the best thing to do here. n nThere were only 2 people working there, so if there's a rush going on, it may take a while for the food to come out. I got the pastrami burger and the chili cheese fries with grilled onions to share with the boyfriend. Super yummy. You will not be disappointed! I crave this place from time to time.looks like I need to visit Vegas more n nI would have given this place 5 stars, but I gave it 4 solely b c of the inconvenience of parking and the restroom situation.",2
"Just had lunch. Very flavorful burgers. Like them a lot. Don't care that much for their shoe string fries, prefer fries that are more substantial. If you're looking for a decent tasty burger, give them a try.",2
"After my first visit at Mechant Boeuf I gave it a pretty damn good review. Well I'm gonna take most of what I said BACK. Because this week I went back for a friend' birthday dinner party and I almost choked on the level of crap I witnessed at this restaurant. Things have changed. nTHE GOOD n nAs an entr u00e9e I combo ed two of them after I saw the same dish fly by to another table and the waiter was kind of forced to comply with my request. I had the Sliders which they call the Burger Flight and with Charlevoix Poutine with braised pork, Migneron cheese. I must admit that the sliders were awesome with the little tangy mayonnaise, cherry tomatoes and perfectly tasting meat. And the poutine was very good as usual. The service was still very friendly and casual. The Good ends there. nTHE BAD n nAnyone who knows me, knows I live for steak. If you wrap it up with bacon its even better, if you slather it with Foie Gras sauce, I have a complete mental collapse from the goddness. This is what they offered. n nIn my previous review I raved about their Foie Gras sauce but the restaurateurs went and changed it to save of food cost most likely and cut it down with pepper sauce. It completely changed the sauce and ruined it making the appeal of the main fly away like a bird. n nNext up was what I dunk in my sauce, the steak. I love eating meat, show me a way I've never eaten before and I'll try it. But the good ol' standards stick with me and a tasty steak tops the list. I've had steak all over North America. There's only one way to eat steak and properly enjoy its flavour, its texture, its juices and that's RARE. You can eat Flank Steak and if it's properly prepared it'll be tender despite being the toughest but yet most flavourful cut of meat. n nI ordered a NY strip rare and what I got was a piece of rubber I could hardly cut through without having the steak slip and sliding all over my plate. Chewwing? That was impossible. I wanted to install a mandibular grinder to pre grind my meat for me. So impossibly chewy steak with disgustingly peppery Foie Gras sauce. But WAIT, it's gets better? nTHE UGLY n nI of course called up the waiter to complained about the rubber boot on my plate and this is where it gets sad and yet funny. The waiter goes and talks with the manager about the situation and comes back to tell me that it's normal for rare steak to be chewy. WHAT THE FUCK? WHEN DID THIS WARP IN THE UNIVERSE HAPPEN? Talk about crappy client service, piss poor knowledge of meat preparation and total lack of respect. In most restaurants where I pay 40 for a piece of crap meat, the manager has the decency to come over to my table and talk to me personally and makes a deal. This time no deal other than to re fire my steak, which duh, would have given me a medium steak and a steak that has already cooled down after cooking cannot be re heated. Go ahead and try it, it's horrible because it boils the meat. n nSomeone else at my table ordered the Pan Seared Foie Gras at 13 a pop. This was the biggest joke of the night. It was barely a quarter of a liver and it was burnt to a crisp. I wanted to scream bloody murder. If it weren't for the fact that it was my friend's birthday party I would have exploded. n nThis is obviously a case of retards with no experience who have no place opening a restaurant who decided to open the next trendy go to hot spot. All form and no function. It looks cool, it's pretty, it's trendy but the food is horrible. M u00e9chant B u0153uf can sling some tasty burgers but that's where they peak.",1

"I had high hopes for this place to bring some entertainment into downtown. While they may be able to pull in headline acts, I would suggest spending your money elsewhere or waiting until these comedians perform at a more accommodating venue. n nThe customer experience is clearly the last thing that those running this business about. First, no matter what time you arrive, you will be forced to stand in an enormous line outside. Second, you will be forced to order two of their horrendous and overpriced drinks. I wouldn't mind paying 13 for a drink if there was actually alcohol in it. You will be best sticking with beer or wine the cocktails here are loaded with sugary syrups, ice cubes and food coloring. n nThe food is the usual fried fare you could get anywhere. Everything is served by a waitstaff under the age of 25 who is constantly confused, distracted and overworked. n nIs it that hard to have a place in PHX where you can see great comedy and get a decent drink for an honest price?

"Didn't like it. That pretty much sums up my entire experience. I thought it was going to be fun, it wasn't.

Those were fun for like a minute.Nothing else here is worth coming here for. n nThe Casino blows hardcore. It wasn't fun, if you walked around NO ONE was winning. I know I shouldn't expect to come here to win, I never do, but hitting something always happens. I did however win 17th in a 400 person slot tournament. That was fun, the rooms were free, though be prepared to walk a 1 3 mile to get to your room. Whoever designed these walkways should be shot, tarred and feathered and then beaten. I will be coming back, however, they keep sending me free rooms, but I won't like it, and I won't gamble here. n n2 stars and a bite me!",1
Sandwiches are good but for the price it's not that good.3 subs and 3 drinks for over 30? I think I will stick with subway.this place isn't that good and when you order a cheese steak sandwich why do you have to add the veggies they normally come with and pay extra? The owner needs to get a clue! You aren't that good to charge these inflated prices.bring them down a bit and see your clientele grow!,1
"I haven't had a korean food for such a long time since my last visit at Sushi Kim, which I swear never to go back again. n nLike the previous reviewer mentioned this place is ""waaay "" understaffed and hopefully the owners will recognize this issue and at least have one extra employee during peak hours before it's too late. n nThe prices for the bbq seemed a bit high especially for the amount served but the rest at least for me seemed reasonable. n nSo far, I've been here twice and both times the food has been great but the service as usual a little slower not because they were unattentive or bad , it's just that there were only two people working upfront as a server, buss er and a host. n nIf you're looking to get a quick bite then this may not be the ideal place to get one. Just saying.",2
"We had a birthday lunch here for a friend in mid September 2010 . n nI adore this place, and went back when my daughter came to town from out of state 2 weeks later. I just had to have another Portobello Sandwich with Israeli CousCous! Fabulous item! n nMy daughter loved her meal too, but I forget what she had. We split our dinners, and she loved the Portobello too. Very tasty, and reasonably priced. They had dimmed the lights and it felt like an entirely different restaurant than when I was there for lunch. Very classy, with great art work. n nLunch was busy the first time I was here, so the service was much slower but that was OK. Took a long time to get our coffee, must have been some problem with the brewer. Other than that, I was really impressed and it has quickly turned into one of my favorite restaurants in the area.",2
I get my hair cut at these types of places and i rotate all the time. There is a guy here mildly creepy and blatently prompting you for gossip. I'm sure he and so many other stylists get a ton of it but i could tell he was prompting me for it. No thanks. When i want to put people on blast i'll do it myself.,1
"I went with my family for dinner and got the Pork Wonton Egg Noodles. They came in a large bowl with lots of broth and some thai basil on the side to add to taste I added all of it . The positives were the broth was excellent, full of flavor and boosted further when you add the thai basil. Second the ""Wontons "" although more like pot stickers were flavorful just as much as the broth. Lastly the egg noodles were cooked perfectly providing a good base for the rest of the components. My cons were the temperature and how hard it was to eat all the components of the dish together. I will say they when I did manage to get a piece of wonton with the noodles and the broth it was fantastic. In the end separately everything was good just hard to eat together as one bite. n nP.S. The dish I described is also available with chicken or shrimp as the protein.",2

The first time I ever ate at a Filiberto's was at this location. I was a little hesitant and my girlfriend ordered for me because she's hispanic and has more knowledge about what is good. We got two tacos and a taco salad and it ended up costing like 25. Afterwards I thought it was weird that it cost that much and looked up the prices. What we ordered cost more like 14 16. n nThe workers here overcharge you because they don't even speak english. It's kind of sad because I've been to a couple in the ghetto of phoenix and they were delicious and the workers are awesome over there. Avoid this location though. Go to the one on 83rd or on grand if you live in surprise.,1
"Same experience as above, booked months in advance and when I called to confirm they couldn't find me. The initial reservation was for Vdara but because they dropped the ball they had to book us a day before we were going to Vegas. The only had suites at Signature which is supposed to be nicer bur still. They sent us a confirmation number and all, but when we called Signature on the way to Vegas to confirm the reservation they said that it was cancelled by the owner. Multiple calls to Jet Luxury and multiple calls to Signature and we got a suite booked. Extremely frustrating and weird business model, not sure how they survive. I want to mention Yolanda who was most helpful on the phone, but I the whole experience with Jet Luxury was weird, frustrating and bad overall. This was a TravelZoo deal so maybe they have a different standard for their full price customers. This review is for Jet Luxury, not related to Signature, I have a separate review for them",1
"You get what you pay for. This aint no 99 cent hot dog joint that you would find on the strip or downtown. The Capital Grille is definitely up there with Morton's and Ruth's.

You can bring a group of friends or enjoy a night out with someone you just met on the strip.",2

"I just don't get it. I don't understand why Barrio is such a hit. Did I hit my head and lose my sense of taste? I doubt it. n nBarrio isn't horrible, but it certainly is not the most amazing Mexican cuisine that I have had. Barrio is the place that a guy who thinks he's in touch with La Raza even though he grew up in Scottsdale and takes his girlfriend to ""a little place in the ghetto "" he knows. For those of us that know what the Barrio is like, Barrio Cafe doesn't live up to its self proclaimed title of ""Comida Chingona "". n nI had the pleasure of having dinner at Barrio with my friend Ayesha. One thing that Barrio Cafe does have going for it is their super potent margarita. Maybe that's what makes all the patrons think that the food is so amazing. I had a top shelf margarita. It was really good! The tequila was smooth and the the margarita mix was not too sweet, and not too sour! I overheard our bartender explaining that the margaritas are 50 percent tequila and the rest is mix. Nice! I should have drank more, maybe this review would be a little better for them. n nWe were seated and greeted by a friendly waiter. He asked us if we would like the fresh made guacamole. Ayesha and I were both excited to try it. He brought around the cart and explained all that went into the guacamole. Well he mashed a bit and then served it to us.um. that's it? Really? It was chunks of avocado with the rest of the ingredients. Ok, you might impress some fools with that mess, but with those of us with mamas that have old, well used molcajetes. this guacamole isn't cutting it one bit. I had to snicker as one half drunk patron next to us declared this was the best guacamole she ever had. sigh I was not impressed at all. Hopefully my dinner was better prepared. n nFor my dinner, I had the enchiladas de mole. They came with sauteed zucchini, which was different than the standard rice and beans you get at other places. The enchiladas were beautiful when they were delivered. The aroma of the mole sauce hinted at their rich flavor. I took my first bite. well. I guess they were ok. I expect mole to be a dark, spicy not necessarily hot , never too chocolaty, and a perfect balance of smoke and spice. This took a good run at it but came up short, and I could really taste the chocolate of the mole. The vegetables that they were served with were overcooked and had no flavor to them. I was given a free flan for my birthday which was very nice! The flan was good! It wasn't too jiggly which Ayesha was fearing and I believe it might be homemade. Good touch! n nWell, I can at least say that I tried Barrio cafe. I would probably go back for their great margaritas and maybe try a different appetizer, maybe after a few more of those strong 'ritas, I'll find out what all the fuss is about.",1

"Otto Enoteca Pizzeria is one of my husband and my favorite restaurants when visiting las Vegas. I read some of the reviews commenting on the pizza not being good and I completely disagree. I was in Italy last summer for three weeks and the food at Otto's is as close to true authentic Italian cuisine as I have found in the U.S.A. The problem is that most Americans eat Americanized Italian food not true Italian food. In italy chicken comes on the side and never smothered in cheese or sauce. I love the bellini's at Otto's. For people who have never tried a Bellini, it is the national drink of Venice. I also love the pizza at Otto's, it is light and flavorful just like Italy. American pizza is smothered with cheese, not Italian pizza. It's too hot in Italy to eat heavy meals. On saturdays they make homemade lasagna which is light and delicious, one of my all time favorite dishes at Otto's. Make sure to leave room for the gelato which is also very authentic to Italy. Real Italian gelato should be light and airy and bursting with flavor and that's exactly what you get at Otto's. If your looking for authentic Italian cuisine then Otto's is the place to go, but if you want crappy Americanized Italian then try olive garden.",2
"Talk about a LET DOWN! n nOf all the things that I did in Las Vegas, this was for sure the biggest, and really the only disappointment. It's truly a shame because I was so so so looking forward to this experience. n nThe Wait OK, so there is a wait to get inside. This is understandable so I paid the extra 15 to get in with only about 15 min. wait instead of over an hour. This however, is just the FIRST of many waits to be dealt with. n nBasically, they have the buffet set up very strategically so that each station has the best stuff at the end of the line, meats, crab, duck, etc. so hopefully to them you use up the real estate on your plate with cheaper more filling stuff first like bread and pastas. I had to wait anywhere from 20 30 min EACH TIME I wanted a new plate of food! I couldn't believe it. Anything that you get towards the beginning of the line is ice cold by the time you actually get to eat it. There is something seriously wrong when it takes you three or four times as long to GET the food as it does to EAT the food. n nJust to drive home how long it took to get a plate of food and how bad the service was they actually RESEATED MY TABLE when I was in line! Are you kidding me? That shows how pathetically long it takes just to get some food here. Basically you have two hours to eat, but good luck getting more than 3 or 4 plates in that time, its just not gonna happen. n n nService Basically non existant. I had to flag someone down every time I needed something, and had to ask 3 times just for some salt and pepper. When they finally brought the S P, of course I was done with the plate that I wanted it for and then when I came back with another plate is when they reseated the table, so I never actually got to use any on my food. Then they left me standing in the middle of the dinning room like an idiot with my plate of food while they figured out what to do. It was pretty embarrassing actually and obviously the food continued to get colder and colder as I waited for them to simply find me a place to eat. Finally they sat me at a four top in the middle of the dinning room and I was able to eat my piece of thin, cold, over cooked prime rib. n nSo, the waits were numerous and unreasonably long, and the service was equal to about a Denny's. But how was the food?. There was none of the stuff that I was looking forward to. No stone crab claws, no half lobster, no caviar, no ribeye steak. There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that stood out from either a quality, taste or creativity standpoint. The snow crab was very watery, as was the shrimp. The lamb chops and prime rib were over done and cold by the time i got to eat them, and they said they don't put the rib eye out until 6 30. really? But you charge full price the entire time. n nI was so let down that I just left, and before writing this review, just to give them a fair shot at redemption I called to try to speak with someone at the buffet. The first call went to a machine that did not take messages, the second call just kept ringing and ringing, finally the third time I got someone in ""total care "" or something, who when I told her about my experience asked me if I talked to the manager when I was there. Look, I grew up in this business including high end, low end and buffets If you reseat my damn table when I am at the buffet line, YOU have the manager come over and apologize. Don't make me work harder after you screw up. Besides, I never saw a manager when I was there, only ""servers "" and a few ladies that walked around with their ipads trying to jockey the table seating situation. I certainly didn't see anyone concerned with people's experience. n nThe bottom line is that the price is reasonable for the buffet, but with so many other places to eat in vegas, there was not a single thing that would ever make me want to go back and wait. to wait. and wait. to eat bland, run of the mill buffet food.",1
Shauna is the best! She makes you feel comfortable and relaxed right from the start.I had horrible carpel tunnel on my right side and it ran all the way up my shoulder. After going to her it is all but gone. I have no more tingling at all. I love her massages. She's not afraid to use some pressure like some are. The bed is the most comfortable I've ever had. The aroma therapy and music puts you in the perfect state of mind. I also like that she adds the cooling eye mask so refreshing and relaxing after working on the computer all day it's perfect for your tired eyes and the hot towels on your feet are just what I needed after wearing heels all day. I'm looking forward to booking another appointment with Shauna and would recommend her highly!,2

"The ambiance was beautiful at The Buffet. Unfortunately, you do not eat the ambiance. The food here was simply terrible and the selection was very limited. We went to the Buffet at 10 am and so we got to experience both their breakfast and lunch menu and it was very unimpressive. n nSushi was simply terrible. The rice they used was no sushi rice and so it was very mushy. And the scary thing was that some of its plates were dirty. n nSeafood it did not exist. No crab legs, etc. Menu was very limited. n nGrill only had one beef item and a turkey. Both were dry as hell. n nAsian again, very little selection. The best item was the siracha sauce. The food was not good. I tasted a few items and passed on the rest. n nItalian they only had pizzas and a pasta item. Both could have been purchased in the frozen food section of Ralph's so there is no need to go to Vegas for that.",1
"We went a couple nights ago and while it was easy to get a seat when we arrived around 6, it got crowded later and people were waiting. The service was inconsistent and we had too many different people bringing us food and drinks, which I found irritating. It took so long half an hour or more maybe? for my appetizer to come that it came minutes before the meals started coming, and everyone at the table had their meals arrive at a different time. To the servers credit, he did take my meal back to kitchen so I could eat the appetizer before my main dish. One of the meals was wrong and they replaced it as quickly as possible with the correct meal, which was appreciated. The food was fine, but nothing special. Mostly it seemed to lack flavor. The zucchini was recommended by one of our servers and it was interesting and I'm glad I got it. I didn't taste the mint until about a quarter of the way into it and that made a big difference in the taste of the dish, adding a level of complexity missing in the other dishes. Probably the biggest problem with the restaurant, however, was that it seemed to not have functioning air conditioning. It was ridiculously hot and stuffy and so uncomfortable to sit and eat, it would have been difficult to enjoy even the tastiest of meals. We all agreed that our experience was mediocre and would not make a special effort to return.",1
I own a retail store and this company had a great solution for me. I am able see the transaction superimposed over the live feed on my camera. Great tool! Asaf also was very professional and provided excellent service. I highly recommend this company.,2

Stay Here everytime I make a trip to Vegas! Love the restaurants on the property and not to mention the great rooms! Never had a complaint. If you're complaining about the rooms looking low end maybe thats because you're in Vegas and you need to spend a bit more and maybe upgrade a few floors because the new upgraded rooms are amazing!,2
I eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but I'm always hoping for a finger in my chili. I never try any of their new sandwiches or anything I stick to the chili. It's by no means good but hell it's less than 2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning.,1

Their lunch buffets 11 am 3 pm are only 6.49 it includes pizza, pasta, salad, dessert, and more. Pizzas were hot, not cold or left out too long. They have a good selection of arcade video games and they host parties. Expect little kids running around screaming. And for the adults they serve alcohol. n nTheir pizzas are good. Their prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is kids and family friendly. The service was good. Decor is old, only knock I'll give them.",2

I swear i would never ever come back even once more time. nHowever, the lamb chop was OK but it was to thin, i think my lamb chops would fly away if i blow it up, nRibs was good. I like their pinapple sauce. nCompare to Fire Fly, this place is way expensive and of course. my 2 thumbs are down for this place.",1
"They were fast I got most things that I ordered within 10 minutes, but was quickly disappointed. Key word being most they forgot several of our orders for well over a half hour and brought out the wrong beer for one person we got a comped beer but still not a promising start. The tuna was a bit too grey. The yellowtail nigiri was described as ""crispy "" by one of our companions, who also claimed to have gotten a bone in his bite. The rolls were stuffed to the gills with imitation crab and a few of the fish pieces were picked off due to their unpalateable look. We've eaten at a lot of sushi places, and I was stoked when I heard people actually speaking Japanese! Plus the scallop sashimi, unlimited uni and oysters was a huge selling point for me, which was the main reason I harassed my party of four into going. While it's nice that these items are offered, the overall impact left a lot to be desired. We tried the salmon which was OK, the highlight of the sashimi. I got scallops a bit dull and chewy, oysters which were fresh ish but not fabulous, shared the ""Skreem inor gazim "" which was one of the better moments, a bit of soft shell crab soooo much better at Bluefin! , a few mediocre pieces of yellowtail and tuna. one of our companions opted out of eating anything, the other barely picked at their food. I had high expectations and really wanted to like this place I mean, AYCE sashimi?! OMG, that'd be AWESOME if the fish were more appetizing. I'll stick with Bluefin, the fish tastes a whole lot fresher and I like their in house specials cajun albacore, special rolls, appetizers, etc a lot more, plus the lower price. The poki at Hikari didn't compare to the poki at Island grill or Yama. It was fun being able to speak japanese with them, and they were fairly attentive, but not worth the trip from my side of town and not worth the price for the quality of the fish. Bummer!",1
"Best customer service and quick! nI love the food, they provided a good amount of meat and veggies. Along with numerous condiments to choose from. nIt's some thing different from boiling point. nIt's worth a try!",2
"Not a huge fan. nNot a lot of flavor and while it comes out hot. Doesn't seem fresh. With other options in the area, I don't plan on returning.",1
"Meh sums it up. nYou can hardly call this a mall, most of the casinos have more and better shopping, more restaurants and exciting things to see. nWe took a stoll, checked out all there was and were on our way. nYes, its nice, clean and new but there was nothing special about any of it. nSave yourself the blisters for a more exciting walk elsewhere.",1
"Carlitos, New Mexico style. Slightly hot sauces, but oh, what flavor! Recommend the burritos any chicken enchiladas and the pork, very tender! Ask for Joe's Special. Maybe you shouldn't go there, I don't want to be waiting for a table. ",2
"Don't be surprised with your experience here if you read the reviews below. This hotel is popular with many types of conventions and large groups. Consequently, the hotel has no problem booking rooms. In fact, they are more than happy to give your room to another patron. I submitted a paid reservation for the first of two nights, only to be told that it did not guarantee the room. However, had I not shown up, they would have kept the money I paid for the room. n nThe room was not ready when I checked in after 10pm LA LV drive . The staff called housekeeping and was told that it would take an hour to make up a room. I reminded the staff that I had a secured reservation and they offered to switch rooms from a two queen to a king with a roll away bed. Huh! I declined and the staff bumped someone else from a room so I could have the room type that I had reserved with payment . n nThe courtyard is trashy and dated. Stay in the tower rooms. n nI suppose that since I checked in late, and at the end of the line of convention goers, I was not informed of all the amenities that I would be charged when I checked out of the hotel. ""Free "" wi fi, pool, workout room, breakfast. all are included in a ""hotel service fee. "" Evidently, in Vegas, free ain't free. n nSo, beware.",1
"Driving up and down on Scottsdale Rd, I was looking for Panera but thought Baja Fresh looked intriguing. It was early so I could find a place to park in the tiny lot they share with Starbucks. I ordered a chicken caesar burrito and thought it was the best thing I've eaten in ages. The wrap was filled with romaine, well flavored chunks of flame grilled chicken, bits of avocado. The salsa bar had several delicious options. I might go back just to snack on tortillas and the different salsas. I hope they open in Albuquerque New Mexico soon.",2
"My statement to my happy hour companion Take a good look around. We'll never see this place again. n nI should have read the Yelp reviews prior to going.I would not have gone if I had done my homework. Sounds like a great place, looks decent and it was pretty busy on the Thursday night my girlfriend and I went. We were very happy to finally get out of the house and have an hour of adult time. n nDisappointed is an understatement. We waited 14 minutes until I spoke up and asked a waitress who had passed us no less than 4 times for a glass of water, at least it was 97 degrees out . She tapped on our table and said, ""no problem, "" then walked right away from us. n nAnother 7 minutes and we asked a different waitress for some service. She absolutely ""huffed "" and walked away. As though we were bothering her? n nWe are 2 45 year old women, with a pretty strong influence in the area of Betty's and for this being our first visit, the word of mouth this restaurant will get from us is unfortunate. My prediction closed in 1.5 years. n nAnyway, no one came by at all. Not at all. No water. No ""I'm sorry. "" No nothing. For over 20 minutes. And definitely no manager around. It was not busy enough to make people wait for water and drinks. Not at all. n nHighly disappointed and the experience completely adjusted our evening. Bummer for us, and an unfortunate FAILURE on the part of the management ownership. I will not only NOT RECOMMEND this place, but I will speak ill of it. n nLastly, I told the staff lingering at the front of the restaurant that we were leaving after not being attended to for over 20 minutes, and they simply looked at me. I wasn't mad disrespectful in my manners just told them that we were leaving. Not a word from any of them. n nGood bye, Betty. I wish we could have gotten to know you.",1
"The best restraint in Phoenix. Sit outside on the patio. Great date night. n nIf you get the nachos as an appetizer, know it's enough to fill 4 people. ",2
"My recommendation Stay close to your gate because their loudspeakers aren't very.loud n nThey have Free WiFi! n nI've been to a lot of airports and PHX is definitely not one of my favorite. Food, drink, and amenities at this airport are seriously lacking. These are all important factors to consider when you have a delay or layover and want something decent to eat. Stay away from eating in the sports bars in this airport. n nBut all of what I'm saying really probably doesn't really matter since who really has any choice in airport these days anyways!",1
"Not too bad, but I have to said If I have to pay the same money to go there again I guess not . Service was poor . Food was ok .",1
"I am obsessed with this place! You can bring your dog and ask them for a puppy cone, and they always accommodate! Their frozen cakes are also super amazing! I wish we had one in reno!",2
"I've been here three times. The strange thing is I've never had tofu here. I always get the AYCE Korean BBQ. Let me tell you, it's really really good! You get to pick and choose what meat you want to cook up. Their side dishes are great. I love the salad they offer. n nFor 17, this is an awesome deal for AYCE. After 11, it's even cheaper!",2
"This is for the PRICE MATCH policy they have, I was ordering the room for June 2014 and realize after placing the reservation I was redirected to a price match guarantee which later on about 2 hours later found a cheaper hotel price for exact same thing for 20 cheaper for a weekend but yes it sounds like a little but they said they will price match plus discount 10 after submitting the file they decline and said they are the same price but I check multiple times on hotels.com so if it's cheaper you must honor it and booking from a offset should save them money but nope. They told me I didn't provide enough proof. How much can I give you other then a snap shot and the form. Very bad service from service department dealing with price match they gave me a rough time so I just canceled and book at hotels.com for 20 cheaper so hopefully flamingo loses money and have to pay a cut to other sites. Go book at hotels.com it's better trust me",1
"They were very helpful, affordable, and nice. They really get the job done. I would recommend them to anyone in the area.",2
Horrible horrible horrible everything! Gaming sucks! Bartenders suck! Food sucks! The only reason for possibly a 1 star was because of a sweet server that walked by and said hello,1
"I just came from this place. We had mild hot wings, catfish, chicken and fries. So not good. The fried chicken was cooked in what seemed like 3 day old grease and had no kind of seasoning. The no seasoning trend goes for everything! Catfish no seasoning, how wings no seasoning. Omg this has been the worse experience I ever had. To top it off they ran out of tarter sauce but gave me blues cheese and told me to dip my catfish in that. Ugh. So not worth 21.83",1
"Probably the best chain of self serve fro yo in Montreal. I'm a big fan of Yeh and come here very often with my girlfriend. They often have new flavors of froyo I have a soft spot for strawberry cheesecake, lychee and chocolate as well as different toppings. The staff is very helpful and it's a cool place to hang out when it's nice outside. n nThe only reason it doesn't get more stars is because it doesn't compare to the US chains like Red Mango and Pinkberry.",2
"After 10 years of working in the service industry in fine dining restaurants, I have now officially had my worst dining experience, EVER! n nIt was my girlfriends first time in Vegas, so I thought I would treat her to a nice dinner and choose Palm due to its review and close proximity to where we were staying. Our server was great right off the bat very friendly and bubbly and able to describe the menu and the evenings specials. We started with a beefsteak tomato Capri which was delicious. It goes down hill from here. I ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare, sides of Au gratin potatoes and creamed corn, and my gf was convinced to order the nights special of prime rib instead of the filet mignon. The sides were more of a highlight than the prime beef. n nMy ribeye was cooked more to a black and blue than medium rare it was okay since I prefer my steak to have its natural juices but came out at a ""lukewarm "" temperature rather than warm or even hot. The prime rib must have been given a salt bath for 30 days because it was the most over salted piece of meat I've ever had the displeasure of tasting no natural flavor existed. Maybe the meat was over salted to cover up its rancid flavor I'll come back to that comment later . The server was made aware of the dislike of her meal and offered to replace the dish, but my gf had already lost her appetite, so we declined. Not another bite was taken from the 28oz 60 prime rib by either of us. n nLater, our server came back to ask if we were finished eating, and I tell her yes, although there was still a significant amount of food still left on the plates. She quickly picked up our plates and rushed of to the kitchen. I raised an eyebrow to the fact that maybe she was just going to pack the leftovers to go. She returns with a desert menu and offers a desert on the house to make up for the prime rib. n nAfter eating the creme brulee very good, by the way , the server returns with our check. I am now wondering where all our food had gone. I ask the hostess if they pack leftover meals to go and she tells me yes. I explain my situation, to take our meals home was not even offered. The hostess and two managers then seemed to be discussing the issue with the server who returned to apologize for the miscommunication error. The hostess returned to the table with the check and explained that it was MY fault I didn't relay that I wanted the food to go, despite more than 50 of the meal was left. She comped our drinks, but we were still charged for the rancid prime rib. I paid the bill, left a 20 tip and left to never come back again. n nEn route to our hotel casino after dinner, my gf began to feel ill. She threw up what she had eaten, once having to run in to a random casino, and again when we arrived back to our room. I felt fine. We can only assume it was the prime rib that caused her to become ill. It was the only thing she had to eat that I didn't, which leads me to believe the prime rib was turning bad, so it was over salted to cover up the rancid flavor. n nAll in all, our server did a great job, except for the leftovers hiccup. The management staff seemed to be a bit snarky and unapologetic considering the experience. I will never return to this restaurant and I will definitely be spreading the word of our terrible experience.",1
"My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress Vicki, who is awesome! And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!",2
Excellent atmosphere and food. I know I've brought my wife to the right spot when she doesn't say much other than ranting about every bite! The homemade butter was crazy good!,2
Enjoy this park the trails on the hill. My dogs love running through all the grass. I like that security is always around so you always feel safe.,2
I had so much fun! Very nice people and the trail was so peaceful. I would defiantly go again.,2
"Los Dos used to be one of my favorites New Mexican restaurants years ago. The Chandler location opened up recently and I was very excited since it was close to where I work. n nHere's the short nPoor service, food was WAY too salty. n nI was greeted as I was coming into the restaurant with who was to be my server flying out the front door. Almost hit me in the head with the door. Once we were seated I noticed the menu was labeled as ""Temporary "". Not sure what that meant. Anyway, I asked if the meat in the burrito was chunks of pork or shredded. the answer I got was ""Shredded chunks of pork "", and after a closer look I noticed pork was not even an option. After several more questions it was obvious the server who I think was a manager, wasn't dressed like a server didn't know the menu at all, so I just ordered what my girlfriend ordered. n nThe food came out hot and in an acceptable amount of time, but after the first bite I noticed the extreme saltiness. Everything was really salty. Main dish, beans and even the rice. I couldn't eat even half my plate before I went back to the chips. When asked if I wanted a to go box I kindly declined. n nWe sat at the table with napkins over our half eaten plates for at least 15 minutes before she came back and cleared the plates. Another 15 minutes passed before I had to ask another server for our check. n nThe most obnoxious part of this experience was when I paid. They use a modified iPad to electronically sign and fill in the tip. I thought that was cool until the server stood over my should as I am about to fill in the tip. Well, I wasn't planing to tip so I just signed it. The server then pointed out quite clearly that I did not leave a tip and walked away. I thought we were done so we got up to leave. As we were walking out the door she chased me down to give me my receipt and to point out once again that I didn't leave a tip. Really? Take a hint lady! n nAnyway, It became obvious to me that our visit ended in the same fashion it began with that server manager person running out the door after another customer walked out with leaving a tip. n nIf you like salt and poor service, this is your place.",1
"Went here for brunch on Sunday after Valentines Day 2009. Long Long Line to wait! We though we'd check it out because we've never been. The Good Made to Order Crepes, Grilled New York Steak, and their Prime Rib was very good my favorite . The Quiches were good too. The Bad the service was horrible and the waitresses didn't give us our Mimosa's until we were pretty much done with our food already. We attended Champagne Brunch and it took the waitresses forever to refill our cokes. Not that much selection on the food, as I expected. I've been to better buffets. Rio Buffet is still my favorite! I don't think I will be coming back here.",1
The tacos are very good.,2
"5 stars for the BEAUTIFUL Christmas decorations! Totally got us in the mood for the holiday season! n n3 stars for service it was nice, but sloowwwwww. Our waitress actually forgot to bring the tea for our ""afternoon tea "". Though, I was perfectly happy with my champagne, but still. n n4 stars for the delicious afternoon tea spread smoked salmon cream cheese, roast beef horseradish, egg salad my fav, and ham mustard sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted or whipped cream, and cutesy little cakes and macarons on the top! Yum! It was so much and so filling, we couldn't even think about having dinner. n nIf you're thinking about a great holiday tea with your family or with the ladies, the dome is the best!",2
"Was called out to my elderly parents to repair refrigerator they were very nice and did not try to sell them something they didn't need, I am very thankful for their honesty.",2
This place is pretty good. I had a cup of southwestern chicken chili with cheese and onion toppings and a fruit cup. Both were really good. Fast and friendly service and you get a good amount of food for the money. I also like that they have a lot of healthy options.,2
"DO NOT USE THEM. I actually called another company and I believe they sub contracted 24 7 Locksmith to me. So, unfortunately, I had no way to know that THIS would be the company I would be dealing with. The gal I spoke to on the phone let me know it was a 29 service feel to come out and 25 and up for labor. Ok, cool, I just needed my USPS mailbox rekeyed as we lost it. The gentleman that came out were decently professional and told me they were going to replace the lock. Ok, that's what you're here for. They finish the job, a whopping 15 20 mins or so and one of them hands me a bill for 250.00. Um. SERIOUSLY?! He tries to tell me it's because I have a large box, whatever but if you KNEW it was going to be a ridiculous amount to re key this box THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SO prior to starting work! He wanted to follow me to an ATM because I didn't have that cash, and the longer I drove the more upset I became. When we arrived I told him no, I was not paying that. He was on the phone with someone in his office, I assume, the whole time. I had two options pay the large sum or wait for it 100 for an ""unlocking fee "" and they would take their lock back. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? They had my drivers license, so I was kind of bent over so pissed I could cry. I ended up having to still pay 180.00 to end the whole scenario. THESE ARE THE MOST MORALLY CORRUPT PEOPLE I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED. THEY MIS REPRESENTED THEMSELVES, AND THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES. Like another reviewer said, Karma will get these jerks! If you take a gander, the BBB has an ALERT on them. I would never have chosen them myself, but a third party send these a holes out. I'm equally upset with them for even doing business with a place like this. SCAMMERS!",1
"I've been to this place a couple of times. stopped by again today after probably 2 years. While the sandwiches are good, its taken 15 minutes to make them on each occasion. plus the sandwiches alone are over 10. and the sandwiches really aren't very big this price also does not include a drink or anything else. While it tastes good, it really isn't a very good value. If you can wait a while and pay more than most other places, this place is for you. Despite the great tasting sandwich, I probably won't go back. I'm really mixed on this place.",1
"Got good pizza here a couple of times and then something happened. Last 2 times I ordered it took forever. 80 min. today instead of the 30 40. Even got a medium pizza instead of a large, cold and undercooked. They said they will credit me but I am still upset about having such an awful meal.",1
Nice room and the bowling alley was cool. n nBig minus for the morning shuttle leaving earlier than scheduled and the front desk denying the fact. We were outside by 9AM but the shuttle was already gone. Be prepared to pay cab fare. n nJust DO NOT RELY ON THE HOTEL SHUTTLE SERVICE.,1
"Bryan is very knowledgeable, very efficient, very helpful and very focused on fixing the problem! My AC guy repaired a wire that had melted in my AC unit, but when it was turned on, the circuit breaker tripped. The AC guy didn't know what else to do to fix it, because it was running within specs. I called Bryan, based on Yelp reviews, and he did everything he could to help me diagnose and fix the problem over the phone he was truly trying to save me the cost of a service call. He had to come anyway and found that it was a very simple problem that was easy to fix, but the AC guy just didn't see it. Will definitely use Bryan again! Really, really nice guy who gets the meaning of customer service!",2
"We try to take our daughter out occasionally and show her a ""grown up time "" but after hiking a long stretch in hot humid weather after the Charlotte's knight game we were confronted by the door man who put a swift end to our night out on the town. The bar did not seem packed and I'm not sure what merits the age limit restrictions from lunch to after dinner time? Was something going on inside that was x rated? Any who, I asked the rule enforcer for some suggestions of close by alternatives and was instructed to step around to the alley and call a taxi and thank god uber was a min away! I guess I was naive to think a dessert bar was appropriate for under age customers.",1

"Came in for the lunch buffet at 2pm and was seated with no wait. Selection was pretty good, and d u00e9cor was nice and modern. But if not for the TV, some dimly lit ceiling lights and the neon from the bar, it would have been literal darkness. The female host was nice, and it was apparent off the bat that she was at least the front end lead. She sat tables, setup placemats, phone orders, etc. n nThe other guy in black shirt and gray slacks only made sure the Bollywood was playing on screen at all times. He bussed a few tables and made himself lunch between dance sequences. I finally got his attention for a soda, which was brought out quickly, but never refilled in the 45 minutes I was there. He was certainly around my table as my plates and neighboring tables' plates were cleared, but my empty glass remained. n n1 adult buffet and soda came out to a little over 15. Not unreasonable, but there are equally good and lower priced Indian lunch buffets out there. n nUnfortunately, the food and d u00e9cor was not so fantastic enough to warrant overlooking the service. n n2.5 stars",1
"I have no clue why this place has such a good rating. It makes me wonder if they are paying people to write good reviews. n nI went here with my girlfriend and her mother and was very disappointed. When we arrived, we were instructed to seat ourselves, which I do not have a problem with because this is the way it's done in New York at a place like this. It even added to the authenticity of the restaurant. n nWe were given menus and after figuring out what we wanted to order, the host came over and took them, but without taking our order. We waited another ten minutes before the waitress came over, without asking if we wanted more drinks, I might add. n nWe ordered a beet salad, some veal raviolis, a mushroom pasta and sausage raviolis for the table, as we wanted to share. The only thing that was close to palatable were the sausage raviolis. However, I could only bear to eat a couple as they were over salted. All the pasta was way too al dente for my taste, maybe even being undercooked. The mushrooms in the wild mushroom pasta were obviously dried and not fresh. I could tell because it seemed like they didn't cook them long enough as they were very chewy. The veal raviolis were the worst part. They were bland and fatty, along with the pasta being undercooked. n nAfter we finished the beet salad, the plates just sat on the table, taking up space until just before our entrees came out. That kind of thing is very bad form in a restaurant. n nAfter we decided that this place is just horrible, we wanted to leave ASAP. We had to yell at the waitress across the dining room to get our check because she was having a very extensive conversation and was not paying attention to any of her tables. We then explained that we were not satisfied with the veal raviolis. To her credit, she did have them taken off the bill, but not before talking to us like we were a bunch of toddlers throwing a fit. I'm still not sure if she was being sarcastic with us or she genuinely thinks people enjoy being talked to like that. n nOverall, this place is a disaster. I absolutely do not recommend eating here.",1
"Chase Field is a great venue to catch a baseball game. It's very walkable. Compared to Chicago, parking is cheap, and the concessions are very reasonable. Best of all you can actually afford to buy tickets. In other words, you can afford to take your family to a baseball game without spending the equivalent of a month's rent in the process. n nIt's clean, modern, and well lit. It's great with the roof open or closed. And you can hang out in a freaking pool and watch a baseball game! Plenty of concession stands and bathrooms mean you won't be wandering aimlessly. n nAfter several visits, I can honestly say I've never not had a good time.",2
"I've eaten at Spinato's previously enjoyed my food service, but my most recent visit was a disappointment to say the least. The waitress we had was a young lady with short red hair. Her poor customer service is what made the experience bad. She was extremely rude the reason I will not be returning to this restaurant. It took her over 10 minutes to acknowledge us to take our drink orders. We were almost done with our meal before she even bothered to check on us. I requested an additional breadstick her response was to roll her eyes state, ""Let me see if I can get you one. "" She never did bring the breadstick. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant location.",1

"Got bourbon? n nSo out for a bite and a drink one night with a few mates we thought we would try Distill. With no real expectations we strolled in to a fairly busy bar. With a brewery style decor that has lounges, table seating, pool tables and a very nice large bar to boot, Distill is great setting for groups or a sit down meal. n nChecking in on yelp you'll grab a Distill bar infused Bourbon on the house. The bartender gave me a pretty sweet Coffee infused bourbon with diet coke. I'm gonna say this was pretty nice drop and if you like a little sweet I recommend it. n nFor dinner we ordered some mash potato bites as an app! Order them! They are amazing. For dinner we got the six pack sliders! A mix or combo of different sliders. Ruben, cheeseburger and Philly cheese steak. All were pretty tasty. n nId like to give this place 5 stars but maybe because it was full and hard to find a seat I didn't get the full experience. For sure a place to come back to and will be a nice watering hole for a lot of people",2
"We were so thrilled when we got booked at the Delano because our room was gorgeous and it was a very special trip for us. I was ready to post 5 start reviews despite the 25 per night mandatory fee for internet gym access and the 4 for a cup of coffee in your room on Yelp and Tripadvisor until I checked my credit card and realized I was charged 4 times for my stay. 1,000 when you're on vacation, on the night the love of your life proposed to you, leaves a pretty annoying black mark on such a special day. n nCustomer service to get our refund was a complete nightmare, waiting on hold for more than an hour and was then passed around from one agent to another for another hour, until, of course, I was hung up on and had to start all over. The craziest thing about being charged 4 times for our room was that we had already paid in full before walking through the door, the mandatory credit card on hold for ""incidentals "" was the one that was charged four times! Thank goodness we didn't use our debit card to hold the room and used our empty credit card, otherwise it could have been disastrous.",1
"So without a doubt, the Venetian is a gorgeous, luxury hotel. And if you plan to spend most of your time in a romantic getaway nestled in a romantic room, this may be the place. Us? It's Vegas baby! Time to get out there and have some fun! n nMy boyfriend had a conference over in the Palazzo and had a discounted rate here so we decided to try it out. The Venetian has been one of my favorite places to wander around in with it's gorgeous looks and great places to grab a bite or two of food. I'm not a fan of the hotel however. This place is well named as Venice is a complex maze of hard to navigate streets and canals as well. I never knew quite where I was in the hotel and it took a good ten minutes just to walk from our room to the casino floor. Since their rooms are in towers, you have to take an elevator up to the hotel lobby, walk down a long hallway, take another elevator up to your floor and then walk down another couple hallways to your room. Simple in theory, but every time I came up I saw people having to stop for directions.just to get to their room! At least there is gorgeous decor to accompany you on your aimless lost wanderings around the halls of the Venetian. Gas lamps, gilded accessories, comfy chairs to rest your weary legs in. n nOur room was very nice however, with a comfy bed, suite layout with separate seating area and a shower AND large tub. Our view was of a parking lot and a parking garage, but had some mountains in the background that were nice if you blocked out the lower view. All in all it was a lovely place, but next time I'll be staying somewhere I don't need a map and extra 15 minutes to navigate.",1
"FOOD not good and cold edamame, who cares that is complimentary I would have paid for fresh, hot edamame. FISH not fresh and definitely not enough selection. n nSERVICE HORRIBLE My family and I try many different Sushi restaurants and by far we were greatly disappointed. We ordered our sushi and waiter, which I'm guessing is owner, told my husband, ""have to get this order in, or you will never get your food. "" We then get our food which wasn't satisfying so I proceed to ask about the Ahi Poke and if they have a small size. He replied with, ""no we only have a big one and there's 18 orders ahead of you. "" Who says that? n nWe left and I wrote a letter of feedback that hopefully will give them a clue and 1 food not good 2 service not good 3 not clean 4 who refuses additional orders and 5 just rude as they clear and wipe table while I'm eating! Really?",1
"I can't explain how a once great bbq joint has slid so low so quickly. They have plenty of trophy's and awards on display, but what they didn't have when I visited was a great meal to offer. I picked my Wife up at work, and wanted to celebrate our 25th Anniversary with a nice lunch. Fortunately she picked Sauceman's, not me. n nThe first warning sign was that they were out of most of the fountain drinks. There was a hand written sign that said to get a can from the cooler. Except the cooler was out of diet sodas. When I asked, the woman behind the counter suggested I drink water. That was strike 1. n nWe received our meals quickly, but before the server could walk away, I asked her if what I received was the 9 pork plate. The portion of hush puppies outweighed the pork on my plate. She said ""yes, they weigh the pork "", then walked away. Wow! That was strike 2. n nMy Wife ordered the brisket sandwich, her usual menu choice. At first glance, all looked good. There was so much brisket that she had to take some out of her sandwich so she could fit it in her mouth. Before she took a bite, I looked at the meat on her plate, and showed her how dry it was. When I posted the picture one of my fellow Yelpers commented that it looked like jerky, not brisket. Strike 3. n nI don't know what happened to them, hopefully they can turn things around again. If it was just some dry brisket, I could forgive them. But between the issues with the soda, and the terribly small portions, it looks to me like this could be the beginning of the end for Sauceman's.",1
"I took my pups here because I'm from Hawaii and I thought ""Hmm, aloha Pet Grooming sounds like a friendly family feel place "". n nI should have known the minute i got there when they practically dragged my dogs in by the leash. I understand my dogs were hesitant, because they knew they were about to get groomed. but at least take them back gently. n nWhen I picked them up, they looked ok. until i saw that my Bichon had had parts of the skin on his paw either shaved or cut off! it was the size of a good nickel! I complained, and they told me that it had already been there. I assured them that it was not there, as there was fresh blood on his fur. and that they did that to him. I demanded parts of my money back, and I believe the guy called the owner or manager. She refused and we were going back and forth. In the argument, she somehow slipped and said that it was because there was a knot so big that when they chopped it off it grabbed parts of his skin. I told them that I was going to look into it deeply that they are held accountable for what they have done and without a hesitation, they credited me 20. n nIt wasnt even about the money. They didnt even call me to or tell me about the cut and they knew what they did. and they had to lie about it. That's very bad. n nFor the sake of your dog, please don't come here. I just read a previous review about the same thing that happened to another dog'. Thats just so horrible!",1
"Food is ok, what you would expect and some items better than expected. n4 stars because we have had several experiences at garcias and with their take out, and only a small mistake that was handled perfectly by management, I believe her name is Michelle, and even when we visit we always see her running around, filling drinks and helping out. Thanks for the great customer service and consistently yummy food!",2
"This place is horrible. The service is so bad and the beer is inconsistent, at least they had some this time. The food was great but I don't know why it took over an hour to get it. Long story short I will not be returning to this place. Whoever owns this establishment should look for a new line of work.",1
"Hands down, WORST service experience I have had in the last 5 years. The managers in the call center are inept, with a total lack of knowledge of their own product. All that they want to do is argue with you. Had the pleasure of speaking with Jose today, and he did not know what modem I had.what modem they were offering.what service was available. Save yourself the trouble, time, and money and go with a service that has a true interest in quality and service. We will be looking elsewhere for a provider, as this one is JUST terrible. You would think that after 7 YEARS of being a loyal customer, I would at MINIMUM receive respect when I call in about troubleshooting issues and product quality issues. I would RUN from this company, as fast as you can.",1
"Oh man, there's an ice skating rink in Las Vegas. n nO O! n nThat was one of the biggest shock for me of this year. Who would of known that Las Vegas has an ice skating? And the price is the same as the ones in bay area! 9 total for adults including skates. n nSo I decided to head down there with my friend since I haven't ice skated in forever! My mind was psyched the whole time because I thought I'll never be able to skate again when I moved here. However, once I went through the doors of the center, and saw this huge familiar ice rink.I felt immediately at home. n nThe rink was huge and spacious, with friendly kids, teens, and adults all skating round and round in circles. Music was EH. Who plays death metal and rap in an ice rink? That was a bit bizarre, though overall it was okay. Having fun with my girl friend made all that just fine. She was having a bit trouble but I manage to stay on my toes. lol n nOne thing they need to do before opening to the public is smooth the ice. When I got on the rink, there was so much skate marks on the ground that made it sort of difficult to maneuver for a mediocre skater like me. n nOverall everyone who comes here will have an enjoyable time and it's probably one of the best 9 you'll ever spent on to past free time during the weekends. n nTIP Make sure to call the ice center for hours just in case they change it due to seasonal months.",2
"Not a fan. n nWent here upon my sister's recommendation but she also said she hadn't been there in about 10 years. So I chanced it because I live really close. n nWe sit down and the first question our server asks us rather abruptly is, do you have a Groupon? I was like, uh no. Is there a Groupon? So I look on my phone and sure enough there was so I bought one 19 for 30. n nI was not impressed with the food at all. Every roll had cream cheese and krab mix in it or some variation of that. So not a great selection. Wasn't especially fresh and definitely flavorless. And the rice to fish ratio in the rolls was way off. They were like all rice no fish. n nOn top of that, our food took forever. Sigh. n nNot a great value. Without the groupon our bill would have been close to 60 for some mediocre sushi. n nSo I guess a lot of people come here for their 20 all you can eat special. We decided not to because of all the rules and conditions. No sharing. If you don't eat it all, you pay for what you don't eat.seriously? n nOne bright spot was the service was pretty good. n nOverall, won't be back ",1
"I came here for lunch with my mother in law and sister in law as the start to a girls' day out. I have been all over the Scottsdale scene, so it's a wonder it took me so long to get around to trying this place out. Let me begin by saying that this cafe is ADORABLE. I can't imagine a cuter lunch place if I tried and I'd come here again and again just for the sweet atmosphere. The service was quick and we were well attended to. My only qualm is that the menu is somewhat limited. There is a giant list of salads with an additional small list of meals that all included goat cheese or brie, which I am not fond of. In the end, I chose a strawberry salad. It was fine, but I don't really like salads, so for all I know it was the greatest salad ever and I just do not have the right palate to judge salads. But lucky for Arcadia Farms, the experience is more important to me than the food itself, and I had a great time. I will most likely return, as I am just totally in love with this beautiful little gem.",2
"The Mirage has always been one of the classiest places on the Strip. Props to Steve Wynn for ushering in the resort era with this beautiful property. Jeers to him for destroying the Dunes sign in a meglamaniacal gesture during the opening of Treasure Island.but I digress n nThe Mirage has stood up well to time, wear, tear, countless invading tourists, varying economies, changing corporations, MGM Mirage excecutive meddling, Ray Horn getting mauled on stage, as well as American Idol visiting. n nOverall the Mirage is still a gem on the strip! The volcano show is still amazing. The casino is beautiful. The atrium is amazing. The pools are very gorgeous. The pricing is generally reasonable as well. n nIf they'd open up their own micro brewery in the hotel, I'd give this place a fifth star. Until the day I enjoy a micro brewed ""Danny Gans weizen "", it'll give them some perfection to work towards.",2
"Jodi Lynn is the absolute best! I had the greatest time during my photo shoot. She made me feel extremely comfortable and sexy. She answered all of my question prior, during after the session. My photos were amazing and I would love to do this again and use her for other events n nI would recommend her to anyone! My boyfriend loved the final products. Don't go anywhere else but here!",2
This place is similar to a chucky cheese for adults and kids. The games are overpriced for sure. The food barely holds a flame to a franchise such as applebees. I have received better service from Chic fil a. 3 out of the 6 tables surrounding the bar were dirty and appeared to stay that way. One table had a steak knife lying on the floor in front of it so someone could trip on it. All in all I was not impressed by any means and probably won't be back.,1
"Quite possibly THE BEST Mexican Cuisine in Las Vegas! My favorite spot for sure! The staff is wonderful, the food comes out quick, hot, delicious, and AUTHENTIC. Being from Spanish decent, everything I have tried on the menu, so far, has impressed me! Being from out of town, I always stop by this place when I'm in Vegas. See you tomorrow ",2
Sadly I don't have a great review I have been to this restaurant several times even had my wedding reception here I have been for Christmas dinner the last 5 years I have recommended it to my customers I no longer feel confident doing so. Our Christmas dinner just was not a good experience this year. First we waited at the bar patiently for a drink. The bartender came across as cocky his rather dry sense of humor was not appropriate. We were seated and told as soon as the rest of our party arrived to basically hurry up and order. The seafood tower was not good the waiter forgot my husbands soup brought our food it was cold when he took it back he acted as if he was doing us a favor because now my husband would have time to eat his soup the worst was we got our food the 2nd time it was still cold and the rest of our party was finished eating. They did take quite a large amount off our bill but my Christmas dinner ended up to be left over pizza after I got home. Disappointing,1
Don't believe the other reviews about going up the street to the other place. The quality of the meats at Aloha is quite a bit better.,2
"Never in a million years would I think to find great Mexican food inside a gas station. However, I've always thought the best Mexican food are found at the cheap joints. It is rare that I like the fancy Americanized Mexican joints. n nAs far as food goes, it's the best that I've found in my neighborhood. I've ordered the mini carne asada tacos. He really hooked it up by giving 2 3 times the normal serving of meat, the chicken rolled tacos with guacamole are crack, the carne asada nachos are large enough to share with 3 4 people. You might as well forget about your diet if you are ordering those nachos. Don't forget to top your food with the red hot sauce. It has a spicy kick to it. n nI like the affordable prices, affordable for the average college student. Cleanliness is always welcomed and it's reassuring to see him washing his hands before each order. n nThe only cons that I can think of Only one guy working and I wish they were open later on weekends. Even though he is fast, I think they can use one more employee during the busy meal times.",2
"I have just gotten back from my first trip to Vegas and we stayed at The Flamingo. We ended up eating at The Burger Joint every night that we were there and it wasn't because we loved it. The reason we ate there every night is because almost every restaurant closed around 11 00 p.m. to midnight! We would trek around town looking for somewhere to eat, and with no luck, we would return to The Burger Joint. n nEach time we went, there was no wait so that was fantastic. The first night, I tried their breakfast, which was great! For the money, you got a lot of food. The waitress was alright. Nothing fantastic. n nThe second night, we had no wait again and had a party of seven. I tried the chicken tenders, which were alright. I've had better at Burger King. The waitress that night was great! n nAs for the third night, we decided to order a pizza which isn't on the menu and comes from the pizza restaurant next door that closes at 11 p.m., but they still serve pizza? Confusing. Anyway, we decided to carry it out, but they still made us sit at a table instead of letting us order room service. So, they wasted a table of seven just so we could sit and wait for our pizza. It didn't make sense. Then the waiter had big attitude for no reason and yelled at my dad who was just watching the TVs around the restaurant. As for the pizza, it was good. Extremely cheesy and good. n nAs first timers to Vegas, we thought every thing stayed open late, so needless to say we were surprised! n nIf you go here, make sure to ask them what ALL is on their menu! They give you a menu that only has HALF of what they make! And I hope you get a good server! Good luck!",1
"No stars! Horrible! I Don't care if it is pet friendly! I'm telling you now, this place is the slums It's broke down and dirty! I don't care how many ""UPDATES "" they do to the place, it's bad. Rooms are tiny! No accommodations at all. Ugh! Never again! Prostitutes and drug dealers hang in the parking lot ",1
"After complaining about my experience at Rainbow, this store allowed me to use my 20 customer discount, as well as my 5 mail coupon. I was going 8 mile terrain running with some friends the next day and needed really good shoes. I ended up being VERY happy for the price I paid for these shoes. The shoes were not only comfortable and stylish, but reasonably priced to begin with at a already discounted price BEFORE my discounts. Very happy with DSW THIS time.",2
"My husband and I have eaten here several times. Every visit has been tasty! The portions are pretty good, so I have leftovers for lunch my husband manages to finish his . We have had steak, chicken, fish, pasta, and meatballs. We've been going since they first opened and although its fun to see all the changes success has brought to them, the expansion is not quite the same as the original area. Hopefully they will make it a bit more intimate in that section. We have not had the desserts ever because we are too full. But why haven't we been offered a free slice of cheesecake? LOL. Maybe next time. We recommend this place often, and enjoy taking friends and family here. I would recommend a reservation for busy times or nights, especially holidays. Great food, great service, very casual and laid back but tasty. Enjoy!",2
"I bought one of those sticker cards where you get the several oil change coupons for a low price. Seemed like a good deal considering how expensive oil changes can be these days. n nMy car was brand new. It had barely been off the lot a couple months. I brought it here for its first oil change after 3000 miles. n nThese guys had the audacity to tell me that I needed to change my front and rear brake pads. I'm a grown man, and another grown man looked me in the eye and told me a car with less than 4000 miles on it needed front and rear brake pads. n nMy trusted mechanic that I have used for several years confirmed the front pads had 75 remaining, and the rear had more than 80 remaining. n nI didn't bother using the remaining oil change coupons. n nIf you enjoy being lied to, and you like unnecessary up sells, this is your mechanic!",1
"Please teach you servers and managers to not tell the customers like it's a great excuse or something that ""it's your Friday "" dreading like they work you to the ground, or that ""I just got thrown into this, my owner just told me to take care of it.

"So in the end, I think I received decent filling work at Town Square Dental but the overall experience is bizarre painful in terms of billing still in dispute to this day and the wait during treatment. n nFirst the treatment, you know it's not a good sign if the dentist is overbooked and bouncing in between 3 patients at once. In my case, all patients were adjacent to me and the dentist was frantically moving from one to one after finding a stopping point. n nI'm also very iffy about doing major dental work here. The recommendation was that I get a root canal and crown all in house. However, my 2nd opinion refused to do a root canal because the root canal was on a molar and she referred me to an endodontist. Good thing.because it turned out I had 5 canals in that one tooth. n nNow billing was an entirely different beast. Since I have Delta Dental insurance all dental dental providers provide the same prices. Some how this establishment DOES NOT. This is the only dental office I've been to whose billing statements do not match my insurance statements. After I clearly overpaid and their billing statements still indicated I owed money. I came into the office with all my statements showing the overpayment. The front desk couldn't answer my question and told me to wait for the billing lady. The billing lady asks me to e mail her all my statements, which I did. I receive no e mails back or calls back for a month. I've tried calling again and again but she has never returned my phone calls. n nI've only received a single sentence email from the front desk saying the 30 I owe has been waived as a courtesy but nothing about my overpayment.It has been almost 4 months to date.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND COMING HERE.",1
Went in and was not acknowledged so I finally said excuse me and asked if I could get a polish change. I was told NO. We are busy! Not it will be 15 min or 30 min just NO! Plus there was only 2 customers there! Extremely rude and I would not waste my time! Went to delightful nails across the street and they were awesome!,1
"We didn't have reservations for dinner on a recent Wednesday night and had been to several restaurants at Bally's and Paris with 30 45 minute waits. We walked over to Caeser's and glanced at the menu at Bobby Flay's Mesa restaurant and then at the Old Homestead. Since there was no wait at the Old Homestead, we decided to eat there. We were seated in the row of booths on the path to the kitchen which should have been a clue, I guess. When we really looked at the menu, we were pretty horrified. Most of the steaks were at least 16 oz servings, which is far too big for most people, and the prices were really high. Everything was a la carte. To add insult to injury, there were only a couple of wines on the wine list that were under 100, and most of those had a retail value of less than 20. It's one of the rare times we didn't order wine with dinner. n nNow I think I know why there was no wait. n nWe shared the ""Steak for Two "", which was 100. It was OK, but certainly not the best I've ever had. We had Gnocchi with Truffles, which was delightfully light when it was warm, but really doughy and sticky as it cooled a little and Brussels Sprouts, which were undercooked and woody. n nI wish we'd at least asked if there was a wait for Mesa or kept looking. n nAs far as I'm concerned, this restaurant is living on it's reputation and location. I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances.",1
"They offer a good variety of food and most of it is OK but nothing is really good. The best thing I had there was the Wonton Soup and it was not the best I've had by a mile. I did go for lunch so maybe the dinner buffet is better but I would avoid it as the Chinese Restaurant is much, much better than this and with less people.",1
"A big disappointment. My brother and I went here to see if they are as good as they claim. Nah. Go somewhere else. nThey say they serve large family style portions to feed at least 4 hungry people, Italian ""generous family "" style. We ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, about 38, and while it came on a big plate, there obviously was not enough pasta. So after two small portions each, we were left hanging. There was still some meat sauce, so we asked if we can just get some more spaghetti. The waiter said the manager said it will be 12.50 more. Since we were unsatisfied, we had to bite the bullet and order it. But I felt ripped off. If they had given enough pasta to begin with, there would not have been this problem. My brother and I always eat at Buca di Beppo and we never ever had this problem. And, my big complaint is pasta is cheap. In my opinion their true hospitality and good business sense to make the customer happy would have been to just give us the extra portion of pasta just to be satisfied, as opposed to being reamed. PASTA IS CHEAP. Or, if they wanted to charge, max. should have been 6. n nThe waiter was also not a very pleasant guy. He was always hurrying, he had no genuine interest, he was perfunctory. Proof we had to ask for bread. We had to ask for the olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip the bread. And though we still had not finished the bread, he swoops away the olive oil and vinegar. We had to ask for it back. n nFinally, this place is really a joke. When you call a place LEGENDARY, it's reputation is vaunted, by its length of it in business, at least, arbitrarily, around 30 years it has served actual LEGENDS, this being Vegas, it should have served and has documented patronage by Sinatra, Elvis, etc. And to be a legend, it really should be respected and renown Carmine's IS A LEGEND IN THEIR OWN MIND, ONLY. Look at their sign ESTABLISHED 1990. THAT IS HARDLY A LEGEND. Overstated, just tooting their own horn, with nothing to back it up. With all the great Italian restaurants here in Vegas I am sorry we even went here. Appropriate descriptions would have been ""Famous Italian food "", or ""Celebrated Italian Cuisine "". LEGEND? Since only 1990? Have you noticed true legendary places? Vacheron watches, depuis since 1755. So give me an effing break Carmine's. n nI also politely told them there, and through their comment place, at their website, of my utter disappointment. No reply. In other words, they don't really care about customer service. All they want is . This place may go on for a while due to foot traffic. But you can rest assured I DO NOT AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL. I'd rather go to Buca or the many other fine Italian restaurants here in Vegas.",1

"This was and will be my only visit to this local establishment. Invited there for a friend's birthday party and it was not conducive to discussions without raising my voice above the steady vibrations of a huge audio speaker right near the table. THe table was on a raised platform next to another large party of about 30 people. there were no other large tables to accomodate us. The food was expensive but not worth it. One young lady was the lone waitress for us and the other party and several other tables it seems and she was running back and forth constantly. It is a large place and if I didn't know better it's strictly a sports party bar that also serves food. What with so many restaurants competing in the S Charlotte Ballantyne area for the same customers, you have to experience a place and then decide. I've decided. Thanks.",1
"Stayed here for business last week and my reaction is meh. Nothing special about this Scottsdale Road property. It was really pretty expensive 279 night in April and you don't get a lot for your money. Nothing ""wrong "" with the place, but you can do better for the money. I don't know how they can call it a ""resort "" unless have a pool qualifies you no golf tennis, no spa, etc. Just a hotel.",1
"My girlfriend was hungry for dessert after a D'Backs game on Tuesday, but it was almost 10pm. I wasn't optimistic we'd find a dessert spot downtown that late on a week night. But low and behold, Yelp saved the day and helped me find this place just a few blocks from my apartment. They've only been open about 2 months, but per the Yelp reviews already seemed to be garnering a fan base. The place sits in a historic home pretty much in the heart of First Fridays territory. In case you get lost looking for this place, just look for the neon ""Munchies "" sign. n nWhen we walked in it was just the owner who also happens to be the owner of JoBot Coffee . Super nice guy. They don't make their own ice cream, but rather have it made by a local co op. Their flavors range from Chocolate Raspberry to Chips Salsa. After sampling seemingly every flavor, I went with a scoop of Cinnamon and a scoop of Vanilla Birthday Cake. When you order a cup as I did, you don't get a cup but rather a Chinese noodle box complete with fortune cookie. Random? Yup. But freaking awesome. She got the Chocolate Superfarm and the Raspberry. There's no seating inside, but there's plenty on the front porch. We were the only ones there not surprisingly since it was so late on a Tuesday , but thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream and overall experience. n nGreat way to cap off the evening.",2
"I have been here to eat sushi 2 different times and I would go back just for the food again. The sushi rolls are huge the sodas are free, mix that in with a lil entertainment and u have a winner.

The smoking here is killer I feel light headed and sick after just over an hour in there. American cancer is not dying anytime soon with people smoking like that. Anyways 4 stars good food, best sushi in arizona.",2

"Yesterday I tried this place for the first time. There were 6 of us including 2 children. The atmosphere was good not too noisy and the music was to my taste early rock and roll . The menu selection was also good and we all found items we liked. n nThe service was quite slow considering only about 1 2 the tables were occupied. It took quite a while both to have our orders taken and to get the food after we ordered. We had to ask for straws for the kids drinks. n nI am a fan of chicken piccata and do not find it offered in many places. It was on the menu and I ordered it it was the worst I have ever had. In this dish the chicken is to be pounded which usually makes it very tender. This serving was so tough I can only guess that it was microwaved. The sauce was too thick too much flour and not tangy not enough lemon juice . As I said the worst. n nNow everyone else enjoyed their orders Philly Cheesestake, Hamburger, Southern Fried Chicken Burger, Chicken Tenders so maybe piccata is just not their thing. But still the service left a lot to be desired. n nI will likely try this place once more to be sure on the service and will try another dish. When that happens I will have a follow up review.",1
"Merkato is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Admittedly, I've only ever had one dish the Vegetarian platter but I've heard that the other meals are good as well. The Veg platter is in fact vegan, and will easily feed three very hungry people! I also recommend the coffee service if you have some spare time. The staff roasts the coffee beans right in front of you, and it's the thickest, richest coffee you will ever have. Yum!",2
"I chose the BBQ chicken salad, which our server said was top notch and his fave item. My friends got burgers and slider meals. n nWhat I got was salad greens topped with battered, deep fried, blah tasting chicken fingers, cut into pieces, and a bunch of BBQ sauce dumped on top. Say what? It's a great looking place and probably cost millions. can't they grill up some fresh chicken rather than serve bagged frozen breaded stuff? n nThe burgers got ok reviews, though the fries were of the heavily seasoned type that get old after 5. The friend didn't like the pulled pork sliders. Overall it was pretty blah, chain like food that when coupled with drinks, makes for an overpriced, underwhelming experience.",1
"I must say this is another of the numerous times that I am disappointed with the customer service in Montreal, but this time it was not only disappointing but also kind of insulting. nWe went with the Groupon offer to experience the Tapas tasting menu. I must say that the food is okay, but my reason for the 1 star review was the poor service we experienced. n nI have been in the restaurant business for 20 years and I understand how sometimes one single employee can ruin the reputation of a restaurant, and it shouldn't be that way. I write this review with the hope that the people that run the restaurant read it and acknowledge that the staff should treat the customers as their one and only priority, and that good customer service is the best way to get new referrals that will help grow the business. n nMontreal is a multicultural city and therefore, what a entree means to one culture could mean different to another culture. When I asked for the beef tartare, I had no idea it was made of raw meat, since in my country it is cooked. When I asked the waiter if he could change it since I had no clue it was raw, he just looked at me with a bad expression and said ""somebody has got to pay for that "" in a very rude way. I had not even tried the tartare I just asked if it could be exchanged. Then, when I asked if it could be cooked a little bit at least, he again gave me that same negative look and did not handle the situation with care and patience. When my boyfriend decided to eat it and try it, I assumed that was going to be the end of it, but it was not. The waiter stopped by again trying to blame us for our mistake, naturally making fun of us. He asked me if I wanted to see the menu again and I just said no. I did not even want to look at the guy. I had never been treated like that anywhere else. n nWhen he came with the bill, we saw the 4 dollars that we had to pay for the taxes, which was perfectly fine, but then underneath the total amount, there was this other handwritten amount about 9 . When we asked what that was for he said it was for ""the service "". I was really in shock and just wanted to leave that place. Since when do restaurants in Montreal add a handwritten and compulsory service fee to the bills? My boyfriend literally laughed out loud when he saw that. We paid and just left the place. We went to another restaurant and spent 50 in food that we could have easily spent at Cielo Tapas if we had been treated properly. n nI hope the service here changes and that customers get treated with respect. In the meantime, I just do not recommend the place, merely for the bad service that waiter provided.",1
Went for my bday. I called personally to ask for a seat with a view of Vegas. Needless to say they didnt have a seat with a view. However the manager sent us over a free dessert which was nice. The food was excellent. The prices a lil high but if you get there before 5 some great specials!,2
"Very friendly atmosphere and the staff are courteous and helpful. There is almost no waiting, they fill the script immediately unlike most other chain pharmacies where they intentionally delay filling scripts in hopes the customer will wander around the store and make additional purchases. They carry hard to find medications. They had in stock an obscure pain med I was prescribed that I couldn't find at 8 other pharmacies I visited.",2
"Sadly I have to give this particular store only 1 star for the first and only experience we had with my son and a tuxedo he needed for a wedding. I brought my son in for not one but two fittings. I had to bring him in twice because he is growing like a weed and we needed to make sure the tux would fit. The first time seemed to be great. The sales guy was professional and suggested we have the tux delivered to the store closest to where the wedding was held for convenience sake. The second visit for measurements was quite different. The sales guy and girl seemed irritated with us and when the original jacket did not fit, they said they didn't have another one for him to try on but they would go ahead and order a size up anyway. They also didn't have the next size up in shoes. This is when I asked to change my request to have the tux picked up at the Matthews store for fear the tux was going to have measurement issues and they told me no. When we went to the MW in Edgewater NJ to pick up his tux we were told they didn't have it and it was sent to the Matthews NC store. We had to go back the following day after they FedExed the suit only to find out the jacket was two sizes to small and the pants were too long. We had to go back a third time on the day of the wedding and finally got a proper fitting suit. We were very inconvenienced and irritated with the whole process. I unfortunately cannot recommend this store for tux rentals and if you do rent from them, I would strongly suggest you have your suit picked up at the location you were measured at.",1
The spas ambience is pretty nice for the price 20 hr . I felt welcomed and greeted with some tea but the quality of the massage is worth only only star. I paid 20 for someone to help lotion me up.that's it.,1
Been to this place a few times and I just don't see what the fuss is! The food is overpriced and the beans definitely tasted like there canned! It's Mexican food how hard is to make homemade refried beans? Yuck! This place is a total disappointment!,1
"My wife and I both travel a lot and we happened to be passing at the airport and thought we'd stop and have a nice lunch for the hour that we would see each other. Thought is the key word here. We both ordered the soup and caesar salad with chicken. Pretty hard to screw up right? Wrong again. Both soups were cold, not supposed to be, and the salad with chicken was just plain bad. The salad had a very light amount of dressing and the chicken was dry. Also, we waited at least 20 minutes for our soup and salads, long enough to drink our can of diet coke, yes can, that they charge over 2 for. Here's the kicker, when we told our waitress she said that the bowl has a lot of surface area and it cools the soup down and the other was never heated to the proper temp. What the heck? n nAnyway, I will not be returning there again for very overpriced bad food. I'ld rather get food from one of the kiosks past security.",1
"Not sure if I'm just getting old but I did not like their stuff. Styles were a little too . crazy i guess. I mean the store itself is really neat, water fountains are always a nice touch, but even fountains didn't make it worth it to ever go back. Anything cute that I did find was too pricey for something that I didn't love. I think most of their clothing was trying a little too hard to stand out . Sorry to say but not a fan",1
"VEGAN DONUTS OH MY FUCK n nis pretty much all that needs to be said. Day two of APP, my friend Lilly showed up with a few boxes full of vegan donuts and It was perfect for that morning. n nGranted, I'm usually semi health conscious, so I totally felt unhealthy for eating vegan donuts like 6 times while I was in Vegas. n nSo worth it. Will be going back.",2
We live by MOTO so we are kinda stuck when it comes to sushi establishments. The sushi blows. You can tell it isn't fresh fish and never taste super. The Mojo beers are the only good things. I don't really trust a sushi place that hides the sushi makers in the kitchen.stuff probably looks like week old shit which it is.,1
" Cute, retro classic style of clothing. Perfect for the curvy, full figured gal! n n Pricey! Most dresses were 130 plus bucks. n n Service? I never see anyone working in the store when I wander in. I think they hide behind the curtain. n n Several 1940's style of shoes to accompany the classic apparel they offer. n n If items were more affordable here, I'd probably make many purchases.",2
"I have been coming here for a few years and genuinely like the staff and Dr. Gramlich. They are always nice and courteous but recent experiences have tried my patience and make me doubt their competency so much that I have decided to go elsewhere. My displeasure has been triggered by their inability to get the prescription in my glasses right. The latest, third attempt still renders my expensive progressives useless. I cannot read with them and intermediate vision is off. I am not an expert on the technology involved but have never had such problems getting a pair of glasses that work for me. And I am used to progressives and I just cannot fathom why they can't get this right for me. It's been ongoing for 4 months now and I am having to wear old glasses which I am not happy about. They seem to always have excuses as to why they aren't right and promise to fix them. I am so frustrated I sought another opinion and was immediately told by the doctor and optician what was wrong. I shared this info with AZ Eye Health and respectfully asked for a refund. Two weeks later I have not heard a word from them even though they said they would get back to me. I am so done with this place. Feeling completely ripped off, not to mention all the repeat visits and time out of my schedule because of their apparent incompetence.",1
"Recipe for Il Fornaio's pennoni alla vodka Heat up one can of Campbell's r tomato soup with half a can of milk and season with Bac o's r to taste. Toss with pasta. n nThe bartenders here were ok, but that doesn't make up for the food. Carpaccio was clearly presliced, covered with plastic wrap and placed in the fridge for serving. Pennoni alla vodka was oddly sweet and very generic tasting, like the worst recipes from the back of soup cans. The tiramisu was also pre portioned, I believe, since the chocolate shavings on top had the chalky look that they get from sitting in the fridge. n nIf you're in a large group looking for something to eat that's not going to offend anyone then I guess come here. If you're looking for something worthwhile to spend money on, then there are much better options close by.",1
The only way these people get two stars is because I liked the food. Well I loved the food. But anyways. The service was horrible. Wasn't busy at all and our server only had two tables to wait on. She either didn't like her job or she didn't like us. Wouldn't even fill up our sodas. And she was just standing there. Will never go back but I hear they have a take out place on Rainbow. I plan on going there to get some food without having to talk to their servers.,1
"The Miracle Mile is a decent mall for the average person. As opposed to going to Caesar Place's Shops and feeling too poor to walk into any of the stores, this mall has stores you can actually afford! n nThe best part is the ""thunderstorm "" that happens in one area about every hour. Another one of the best FREE attractions in Vegas, be sure to watch the storm as the ""sky "" of the mall darkens, thunder rolls in, and it ""rains "" over the ponds in the middle of the mall.",2
"Didn't like it, but we have the best Mexican in Dallas so I am biased. n nThe margaritas were decent. Salsa was ehh, just had brisket tacos for apps.Cute patio. Live music, as in the guy with guitar singing ""la bamba! "" n nWouldn't go back. Crowd was kind of boring. Other places along Scottsdale Blvd looked way more lively.",1
"I will put this as simply and in as few words as possible. If you don't eat here every wednesday and thursday you are an idiot. n nwed 99 cent fish tacos, 1.50 corona nthurs 1.25 assorted tacos, 99 cent margarita n nsee you there",2
"My date said the place smelled like onions when we walked inside. It did a bit, but it eventually faded away. The date got some four cheese flatbread pizza which looked decent and my flatbread blackened chicken sandwich was actually pretty tasty. It had some orange sauce chipotle? that really upgraded the level of taste. The fries were hot and firm, not like my 50 year old date's body, but can't win them all. The bud light was 3 bucks and reverse happy hour was kicking off at 9pm which meant cheaper beer and food specials. The bartendress was attractive and we both could not help but to stare. A good location for this chain and not too crowded due to the family area it is located.",2
"I have the nickname of the resident sushi master because everyone I know comes to me for sushi recommendations. Kaya is always one of the three places I mention each time. I've frequented over 20 sushi joints in the Vegas valley and this is still one of my all time favorites. n nFirst, they are open late, and by late.3am is awesome for those late night sushi cravings. Second, 21.95 for dinner just can't be beat! I actually like that they serve soda in cans and the price includes free refills. They have a wide selection of flavored saki's and a decent beer selection. n nThe food is just awesome. Generous sizes of fish slices for nigiri, the rolls are hands down the best I've had, and they have a huge selection of appetizers including skewers. n nThe service has always been top notch in the numerous times I've visited. One of the managers always comes up to me and lets me know that it's nice to see us again and asks how the service was when we are getting ready to leave. n nYou can't go wrong with this place. Trust me!",2
"Had the veggie pizza. and added bacon! Best pizza I have ever had, crust was superb!",2
"The rating would have been 2 stars but after our dealing today it is not worth 2 stars. When trying to cancel our membership we were told that even though we were now on a month to month contract we would have to pay into December regardless. We apparently were a few days over our 30 days notice. that as we were repeatedly told. is in the contract we originally signed. The assistant conveniently mentioned this after we signed our termination agreement. When we asked to speak to the manager she said it was out of her hands.what is the point of being a manager?.They were perfectly capable of reducing our monthly payments when we informed them we wanted to leave.but waiving a ridiculous fee which is the equivelent to stealing is out of their hands.so a tip for everyone who wants to reduce their monthly fees.threaten to join another gym. Beyond that the gym can get very hot, bathrooms are often left in a mess and there can be long waits for equipment.these things we often overlooked because no where is going to be perfect.but it is out of our hands now.",1
"So this is not a positive review, but I do own some of the problem as will be outlined below. nTook my MTB in to get disc brakes installed, wheels tires set up with Stan's no tubes, and purchase a Surly Tugnut and install it since it was already in there . After I told him what I needed and that my budget was around 100 the mechanic verbally quoted me a price of 105. Told him it sounded good, gave him my contact info got my ticket and took off. This is where it is partially my fault Two days later when I actually took a look at my ticket, the quote was 140. I called the shop and asked what was up, and the mechanic I spoke too pretty much told me I was out of luck and that I should have looked at my ticket albeit he was more polite than just saying that . So fine, I was willing to own up to that and shell out the extra 35 bones. Picked up the bike, and hit the trail for the first time the following morning, and quickly heard that my rear caliper had not been installed correctly and that a bolt that attaches the caliper to the frame was rubbing up against my disc. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this shop, even for them to fix the problem they created, as I can't really trust them to be honest about how much they are gonna charge me to fix their own mistake. So, two stars because there are definitely problems with this LBS, and I will not be returning. But not one star, because I definitely need to own part of the problem.",1
"Starbucks is Starbucks, Great to meet friends.",2
"Okay okay, so I was raving about this place after my first visit.now, not so much. I went back and ordered the same thing I got the first time fish tacos. They were okay, not as good as the first time. The people next to us complained to the manager about the ribs being cold. My mom had ordered the same dish so we were a little scared and hoped they took the information back to the cooks. Her meal came out and it wasn't very hot, it was pretty much warm on it's way to cold. She didn't complain because she isn't like that but I told the server at the end of the meal just so he would have a second opinion on the ribs for the night. The service wasn't very good either. I'm not sure I'll be back. So disappointed, I thought this was my new fav.",1
"Although I have never bought anything here, and probably never will, it's a fun place to make laps around and take in all the odd, mysterious, sometimes tasteful, but mostly tacky items.",2
"These are the BEST donuts! I have been going to Frinedly for many years and they truly have the best tasting donuts in town. Prices are reasonable also. Only downfall is that they only accept CASH, no debit or credit.",2
"The fountains are what its all about! Not only is the water show something you should witness, but there is a chocolate fountain inside the Bellagio, which is every chocolate lover's dream. The Jean Philippe pastries chocolates is a hidden gem within the hotel. The almond croissant is worth every penny! The shops are impressive. The casino is pretty big, but I didn't like the atmosphere. The lobby ceiling has all murano glass is centrally located along the Strip. We saw the water show at night, all lit up was a sight to see.",2
"An endless parade of perfectly charbroiled meat on skewers and carved table side. If that weren't enough they have an extensive salad bar with lobster bisque, charcuterie sushi, and salad if you must . I must also mention the cheese rolls. speaking of rolls, be prepared to be rolled out of there after you have eaten roughly your body weight in filet minion, beef ribs, and flank steak. Worth the short drive from the Las Vegas Strip. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",2
"This place was packed and I was completely unimpressed. You stand in line for you meal, order, take your marker to the table and you're served. n nNot so bad, as I was looking for a light salad type lunch. I ordered the chop chop salad which was ok. The salad has wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette. n nWe also had the Emerald Spinach salad with chicken which was better. This salad has spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette. n nAmbiance note There's a Yelp and Facebook ad on every table. Seriously, the ambiance was institutional and very chain like. It's a baby magnet and the acoustics are horrible as the metal ceiling caused the noise to bounce all over making for a really loud place to eat. n nLast, there's a bakery, but I honestly thought the bread was boring, bland and too tough of a crust. n nThis place may get a second chance, but only for take out and no more Chop Chop salad. Portions are reasonable, but a far better salad is served at Paradise Deli with a lot more substance.",1
"What a letdown of an experience from the ""city that never sleeps "". n nEmpty main bar, after a while we were herded into a smaller room so it gave the appearance of it being packed, but then people just got bored and left. n nI know there's not reallllllllly a gay nucleus in LV, but you're better off going to some of the other clusters of bars SE side from the strip.",1
"Made a reservation for a large party 14 and they accommodated us in a private area. I thought that was really stellar of them. I did get a glimpse of the tea area itself and I thought maybe if I wasn't in a private area I wouldn't do the tea. It was basically a nice couch and table area off to the side of check in so there really isn't much privacy or ""high tea "" experience. n nThe hotel itself is not that easy to find. My group had a hard time finding the entrance, so take a cab if you opt to go. n nIt has great views and is nice and quiet. A good option if you're looking to recover from a long night out.",2
"Mmmm, just thinking about Romanelli's cheesecake makes my mouth water! I got there by accident, but now I think it was fate. I fell instantly in love with the atmosphere and the service was really great. Food is delish, the people are awesome, I can't wait to go there again.",2
"DO NOT GO TO THIS CLINIC! My dog died as a result of negligence by both Dr. Ferrara and Dr. Clinton. I filed a claim with the veterinary board in September and after a lengthy process they finally made their decision yesterday. The findings were ""medical incompetence, failure to communicate professionally and a minor records violation "" against Dr. Ferrara, who was my vet but I saw Dr. Clinton on several occassions when he was not available. The board also decided to file a claim against Dr. Clinton based on both of their testimonies. My dog was diagnosed as diabetic Memorial Day weekend and was dead right after Labor Day. I went in almost every week to get his blood tested and it wasn't until I finally took him to another vet that I found out how many basic things these two vets didn't check which could have been easily solved. He was so sick that as a result we had to put him to sleep. n nThe board won't decide their sanctions until the next meeting late January and I understand he does have 30 days to appeal but I don't think he would be successful after the unanimous votes of the board.",1
"I try really hard not to give a negative review but I just have to this time around. I'm at a 5a7 and ordered the angus burger. It was a brick and dry, I couldn't even take a bite. They offered to change it, I refused because it was awful. Never again will I eat here.",1
"The location has closed AGAIN . Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.

"This is our brunch stop before we return to the Bay Area. n nArrived on Sunday at around 10am, the place is packed with a wait line, but the wait was shorter than I expected. After around 15min, we were sat at one of the spacious booth. n n nOrdered nLobster Fest come with real lobster meat and avocado nThe Sparticus asparagus, mushroom, cheddar cheese nTried out their pumpkin bread and the banana bread instead of regular toast. nAlso ordered one hot chocolate and a side order of one pancake. n nThey served the two pieces of bread first. Both were moist and tasty, but the banana bread to me was a little bit too sweet, whereas the pumpkin one had just the right amount of sweetness to it. If you have a sweet tooth or like banana flavored, definitely go with the banana bread. You just can't go wrong choosing their bread instead of the regular toast offered at any diner. n nBoth omelet came with a generous serving of ""spuds "", which were freshly cut potato chips. They were crispy and very tasty, but since chips were easier to carry to go and much easier to consume on the road, we saved most of the chips for our way home. We knew before we ordered that the omelets would be big, so we ordered two for the three of us to share. And indeed, even between the three of us, we couldn't finish the two omelets. The lobster fest was pretty good, and did indeed come with real lobster. But what I liked was the sparticus, the asparagus invention was a surprisingly tasty, and somewhat healthier version. I say somewhat because the portion is too generous to be called healthy! n nAnother plus they offer you one free refill for the hot chocolate! Yes, it still won't compare to the unlimited refill for the coffee, but this is the first time I've ever seen a restaurant offer refill for hot chocolate, so color me happy! n nOverall a great meal, very friendly staff, easy location. The spuds were still crispy enough after a 9hr drive, and with a little bit of reheating I recommend baking instead of microwave back at home, tastier than ever. n nIf I'm back in LV, I'll definitely visit this place again.",2
"I took my curtains in to be dry cleaned and I didn't put them up until yesterday I had it done the first of August. Well, to make a long story short I had water stains on 2 panels, these were not cheap curtains. I will never, never take anything to them again.",1
"Service was good, but the cut of meat they provided on a 50 NY strip steak was maybe select at best. For this price I don't believe it is unreasonable to want choice or better. Also the sides are priced too high for the portion or quality 10 16 . Finally the salad or soup is also priced beyond what other comparable restaurants charge, 18 for a side Caeser. I recommend Strip Steak, N9ne or Capital Grille over this place.",1
"Everytime my family and I went to Las Vegas we'd go to this restaurant cos there weren't many good Argentine places near us. But whatever good it used to be is fading fast. My parents got asado and even though it was a little pink despite asking for it well done it was decent. The mollejas were good, the chimichurri was great, the bread seemed to be heated up in a microwave and was soft. The ricotta ravioles I got were hard and pretty bad, I couldn't even finish the plate. The masa of the empanadas were kinda doughy and unpleasant. The day I went there were three women working. One waitress was sweet, the other was. Just having a bad day I guess. nI didn't get a refill on my drink til I was done eating, and I can understand that when you're busy you forget but come on, they checked on us twice throughout the whole meal. If you want something be sure to shout for it. nOverall if you just want argentine cuisine for a decent price and aren't expecting a 4 star meal this is the place for you. I used to really love this place so I'm hoping they just had a bad day and will get back on track but as of right now I'm not planning to stop by next time I'm in town.",1
"Alright, please don't hate on me. Coming from the Toronto area, where there is an abundance of AYCE sushi joints, I have fairly high expectations for service at AYCE sushi joints each order should be served within 10 15 minutes . n nLikes n The sushi was pretty decent as was the popcorn chicken. It was fresh. n Once you place your order, they give you an electronic print out of what you ordered, so you can tick it off to make sure you got it. n nDislikes n Way too loud in here. It's packed but it's so loud, the servers can't hear you. n It took just over 30 minutes for our first order to arrive and it wasn't that much. n We placed the 2nd order right after that as we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. We only got a portion of our order after another 40 minutes. For most Toronto AYCE joints, you have 2 hour limits but you get your food very fast. If this place has a 2 hour limit, then it's not good as all as it shouldn't take that long to get your order out. n Servers just dump dishes on your table. Granted, they are busy, but it needs to be at least respectable. I find it quite rude to just dump dishes on your table. n nOverall summary While it is only 15.99, I find that you probably won't get your money's worth unless you order everything upfront. Not really great value.",1
"Nom nom nom. Delicious cocktails and lovely food.

Though a bit on the pricey side, it's a great place to hit up on a date or with a group for an evening a little more on the formal side.",2
Semi overrated. friends ordered large platters around 15. A 20 order and would give you left overs for tomorrow. Didnt seem like they had as many toping offers as rumour has it. First time for me there so ordered 11 sampler. should have been 5 it was small and just plane poutine. The cheese wasnt even melted as the gravy wasnt hot enough. Their crushed fries are the good and sweet potatoes. Small glasses of water with super slow and unorganized waiters.ambience was basic and blah. Something to try once and order the full big meal and decide yourself if its worth it. Im not going back.,1
The dessert case will bring you to your knees in reverence for the hallowed pastry chefs of Las Vegas. n nThe bacon is a little rubbery in texture. But I would quit my job to travel to the sprawling pastures read feedlots where the prime rib is raised. Mmm. Prime rib.,2
Bad bad experience. Got sold on a hand car wash to clean the mud from underneath. Came out with mud still caked on. And. They lost my antenna. Why would you need to take the antenna off if you were going to hand wash it!? Save your obey. Go the 5 wash.,1
"Cupcakes looked so yummy and very appetizing but the flavor wasn't there. Tried the cherry limeade cupcake and it didn't taste fresh and there was hardly any flavor in the cake or frosting. Tasted like an overload of sugar and couldn't even finish eating it. Not worth the money at all. And my sister had the Carmel one and lets just say, it was so hard that she was literally had to take a sharp knife just to cut it as the butter knife wasn't strong enough.",1

Am I right? n nAnywho, I broke my rule and I found the exception! n nBeing famished from a booze binge and some hardcore dancing, we sniffed the air like dogs for the closest eatery and like a godsend, right off the elevator, we found backstage deli. n nI got the chicken pesto sandwich on ciabatta with chicken soup and my friend got the hamburger and fries. Both were delicious, fresh and hearty and it was more than enough to feed our mouths alone. They even include a large WHOLE juicy pickle to munch on as you devour your vittles. n nSeriously, if this is what they're feeding people backstage, sneak me in!",2
"Best Steak We've had, Ever To Date . The only problem, Over eating! Had the Largest Prime Rib, and was AWESOME. We are VERY picky about our steaks, my date had a New York, and both were cooked perfectly. Price was moderate, and decore is what you would expect in a New York restaurant Similar to Sardi's atmosphere , Theres a reason your steak comes by itself and sides are seperate! n nCant wait to try the Gallaghers in NYC.",2
"We ordered a large 1 2 pepperoni and 1 2 sausage, mushroom, and onion pizza with the 20 wings special that was advertised in a flyer for 20.99 delivered to my house. The girl that answered the phone said that the coupon was only good for a 2 item pizza. I said that since I was only getting 4 half ingredients that it would be equal to 2 whole ingredients, she said cool. The pizza was delivered before the promised time of 45 min. When delivered it was hot and fresh. They use fresh mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms which beats a lot of places around here Luckys Pizza, Rays Pizza, Grande Pizza, Fuzzy's pizza. . The crust was in between a thick crust pan pizza and a thin crust pizza. It was flavorful and almost a little buttery. The sauce was the perfect ratio to cheese, unlike Rosati's which tends to use way too much sauce for a thin crust pizza. The cheese was good and not too thick. The pepperoni was the the big slices like the slicing pepperoni that Boarshead carries. The Italian sausage was flavorful and not dry for being a sliced link sausage. The onion and mushrooms were fresh and tasty. The wings were good but some of them weren't tossed and covered in sauce. All in all Cousin Vinnys did a great job. Since I make pizzas I am quite critical of the ones I get delivered. I am glad we ordered and will definitely order again.",2
"This place was everything we hoped for and more! We spent 8 years in Japan and this is a great piece of 'home', with a real Izakaya feel there were 5 of us and we ordered lots of food and had it family style the way it's meant to be. Sushi was great, fried rice, fried shrimp, katsu don made the Mr's mouth water and it didn't disappoint some skillet steak for the unadventurous one and all I can think is I can't wait till we go back. SOON",2
"Stopped in with my son after a few hours of playing video games at Dave Busters. I absolutely insisted that we not eat at Dave Busters since their food is really bad sometimes. n nAnyways, we decided to order something to share since I cannot eat alot. We got the cheeseburger pizza and it came out as described although I thought the amount of protein on the pizza was really skimpy. It was really lacking in meat. After taking off the heaps of lettuce that was on the pizza the Chesseburger pizza is like a big mac in pizza form it was clear that there just was not a lot of meat on the pizza. n nOverall good service. My kid can sure drink the lemonades and the server was able to keep up with him. Would we go back? Eh.maybe. Not real compelling due to the food. Maybe we will try something different next time.",1

"I am so done with this place! This is the third time I've shown up to a closed Haven Burgers during their ""business "" hours. Burgers are good but not worth the annoyance, waste of time and gas.

My favorite dish and the one thing I always get is the cippiono. Hence my review is based this dish. It is the best in town including the price. I've seen some charge as much as 31 for this dish at other oyster bars. I've had it here several times and it is good everytime! So yummy!,2
"We had family in town and made reservations for dinner at the Heritage Tavern. I was very excited to try this place, but came away sorely, sorely disappointed. That's not to say that there weren't some highlights, but the lowlights and moments of sheer mediocrity dominated. n nATMOSPHERE The space was very nice and the seating was comfortable. Our party of six had a great table that seemed to be both centrally located and somehow shielded from the hustle and bustle on a busy Saturday night. n nHowever, we all found it to be uncomfortably hot in the restaurant, and our wine had to be kept at least 10 feet from the table, which was odd. n nSERVICE The service was somehow both warm and pretentious at the same time. The waiter promptly announced that, ""I don't have any additions to the menu tonight. I won't even use the 's word' specials that other restaurants use to try to feed you repackaged leftovers. "" n nThat was the first 'are you kidding me?' moment. The second was when another waitress came to the table with a, ""dish compliments of the kitchen. "" Was this some sort of innovative amuse bouche? No. It was bread. Don't get me wrong I'm all for serving a basket of bread, but don't act like your bestowing some amazing gift on me. It's bread. n nOh, wait. it's not just bread, because for some reason the plate had to be explained to us. See that butter? It's honey butter! See that little cup with a few pickled veggies on it? That's a little cup with a few pickled veggies! And did you notice the random little pile of salt? That's ""course sea salt, to cut the sweetness of the honey butter. "" I'm not sure how you're supposed to do this is every member of the party supposed to lick their thumb and grab some? Somehow I managed to deal with the sweetness of the butter without doing that. n nAll that being said, I actually didn't mind the service. The waiter was friendly and classy, and he handled our one major issue see below gracefully and appropriately. n nAPPETIZERS I had crispy head cheese with escargot. The head cheese was fried into two little croquettes. They were light and not too dense or heavy. I wouldn't have known I was eating head cheese. The escargot, however, was completely lost in the dish. I scraped a bit off one of the croquettes and it was very good on its own, but I would have had no clue that it was even there if I had eaten everything together. n nSeveral members of the party had a beet salad. Everyone liked it. No one raved about it. In general, I thought that the appetizers were fairly successful, if not amazing. n nENTREES And here's where the wheels came off the cart. My mother ordered the Wagyu burger. It was tiny and served on the edge of an enormous plate with absolutely no garnish or accompaniment. n nMy sister had the salmon. She said that it was, ""very fishy. "" n nHer fiance had a sirloin. He didn't say anything about it. He's very polite. n nI had the bouillabaisse. It was pathetic. This is a simple dish, and it needs top quality ingredients to work. This wasn't top quality seafood. It was absolutely indistinguishable in size, taste, and texture from the stuff I can buy frozen at Woodman's. There was hardly any broth at all, and it somehow didn't taste like seafood at all. It was just vaguely salty. This dish should have never made it out of the kitchen. n nThat wasn't the worst dish on the table, though. My wife ordered a pork chop. That was apparently sold out, but the waiter said that they could make the same dish with a pork shank. What came out was a large bone with a little sliver of meat and an ENORMOUS amount of fat. I honestly have no clue how this pig even walked on a shank link that. It was disgusting and inedible. Had they not taken it off the bill, it would have plunged this to a one star review. n nThe only person who was happy was my father, who wasn't all that hungry and ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese. That was one of the cheapest items on the menu. n nIn sum, they sent out three mediocre entrees and two completely unacceptable entrees. n nWas the food bad? Not really. Was it anywhere close to what I would have expected for the very high prices? Not in a million years. n nI haven't had such a disappointing meal in some time.",1
"I went back for a second time to Brio since the first had been un memorable in a large group. The decoration is nice and seems to have a cool bar. n nThe food is mediocre at best, overpriced for what it is, bad mixed drinks. Service is OK.",1
"This place is beautiful, and considering the owners I expected nothing less . that said . where the HELL is the candy? n nI'd say about 80 90 of the candy is readily available at your local Circle K . so I'm not sure I really get what's going on here . n nLet's hope they get more hard to find jems in the future .",1
"I was out last week and saw this place on Yelp but was unable to try it out. Back again in Vegas and the wife and I were tired and decided to order some pizza and have it delivered to the room. Even though the website we ordered through said 35 to 45 minutes, I expected at least an hour since it was Monday night and football was going on. I was right, it actually took 1 hour and 10 minutes, but like I said it was expected. n nOn to the food! We ordered a 16 inch all meat pizza and a dozen wings. The pizza was very good, definitely what we call a fold over, meaning you cant just pick it up and eat it without folding it. I was very impressed with the price as well as the taste. The wings were also very, good, not as big as others have claimed, but they were crispy and not soggy like other places. They delivered right to the room and the man that brought the food was very polite. If you are ever in Vegas and decide that you are tired of the hectic eating, I recommend this place.",2
Great food great service. Our waitress Victoria was very nice and attentive. Really enjoyed our family brunch.,2
One of the best minestrone I've ever had in a restaurant! Impressive! Other pasta and dishes are good as well.,2
"Made reservations. Show up and am greeted by some exceptionally impolite hostesses. I'm about to drop north of 2 300 and the best you can do is scowl? n nEnjoyed the rosemary bread with lardo. Ate too much of it and skipped the appetizers. I recommend having a Fernet Branca to ease the stomach at this point. n nOn to the main double rib eye, Chicago style. Pleased to say that after a not so pleasant intro to the restaurant, the wait staff was spot on. He brings out the small cow, lets us appreciate it, and carves it before us. Piles it onto our plates, and remnants of the bone into the centre of the table. n nI've eaten at a lot of steakhouses, while in terms of location, decor etc Carnevino is not my favourite. In terms of the actual steak Pretty hard to beat. It was that good. Melted in your mouth. n nAt end of meal, waiter then comped us some Nonino Amaro which he wanted us to try we had been talking Italian bitters earlier on . Amazing.",2
"I feel like two stars is generous but one star is because my friend and I still had a good time and the other star is because we got the Cadillac Nachos for free with the Miracle Mile coupon book. This place was cute and fun but the food was terrible and the service was slow and nonexistent. Our food was cold, my friend got the wrong drink, and her order was messed up three times even after sending it back . We won't be coming back here.",1
"I don't think I've been to a Wendy's or Burger King intentionally since I discovered Cook Out. This North Carolina mainstay easily takes the local fast food crown on speed and freshness. I heard a rumor once that the target time between your completed order and when you leave the window is 90 seconds that's half the time that Starbucks allots, and you're getting a lot more than coffee! Everything I've ever eaten from Cook Out here, or any location of the 70 strong chain tastes like it was made just seconds before I get it. The burgers and veggie toppings are crisp and juicy. The corn dogs are still steaming when you bite through the breeding. And the hush puppies hit the styrofoam tray so hot that they often melt into or through the foam. n nEven without these surefire winners, you can't beat the Cook Out value. Five bucks gets you a Cook Out tray their combo meal which lets you pick one of eight main events the Big Double burger and Spicy Chicken sandwiches win big . Then you get to pick two yes two sides such as fries, hush puppies, onion rings, a corn dog, chicken nuggets, chili, a chicken tender wrap or a chicken quesadilla. Yep. Those are sides, and you get TWO. Toss in a big soda or a huge sweet tea and you've got more meal than any other burger joint for 2 4 less. That's beyond a deal, it's just about crazy. n nMy one issue with the food is really unsurprising after a while, it all tastes the same. Most of the deep fried foods have the same taste, more than likely because they're all fried in the same grease. Even the burgers and buns get that flavor too. It's easy to combat this, of course just don't make the mistake I made and go 2 3 times a week when you discover Cook Out. n nBut if you need that greasy fast food and want something now, you can't beat Cook Out on speed and freshness. The fact that your wallet will thank you is the icing on the cake or more accurately, the cheese on the burger .",2
"This place has roaches! I already had my laundry in the washers so I risked it today, but I can never come back here, or I might find myself going home with a bunch of new very nasty friends! It looks averagely clean, there was soap spilled all over the washers, which wasn't from me because I only use pods. I've never used the dry clean service here, but I won't now that I've seen all of the roaches. I just hope the dryers are hot enough to burn them if they are hiding in there. I killed one that was on one of my washers with a dryer sheet. I saw 2 more on the floor and placed my basket on some seats so that it might have less of a chance of them hiding on them. I will never come back here again. It's a shame it was the one closest to my apartment.",1
"I've been coming here since it opened in 07' or 08'. Yes I was a ""teenybopper "" when it opened.lol My friends back in high school used to just spend the whole day frolicking the grounds, shopped at H M, ate at claim jumpers and watching whatever movie was on the the old Rave theater it's not AMC . Now we do pretty much the same thing but with wine and we don't spend my whole day here.haha n nIt's a great place for all ages and it's very pet friendly. If you want to enjoy Vegas air and shop away from the tacky tourist attractions this is the place for you.",2
My favorite sub place! The staff is friendly. The sandwiches are delicious. The soda machine has endless combinations. It's nice to order your food and have it brought to your table. Definitely bringing everyone here!,2
"If possible, I would give A Perfect Sole zero stars.and I never even had a chance to visit the place! I purchased 3 certificates for a ""relaxing express pedicure "" from WeeklyPlus.com, one for myself and two as gifts. Since the purchase date, I have repeated attempted to call and schedule appointments, alternately leaving messages for Toni the owner or hearing that she was so busy but would call me back in ""10 minutes "". I've never received a call back and, when she did pick up the phone during my calls, she was pretty rude. One friend who received my gifted certificate was finally able to make an appointment after repeated calls, but has said that the woman she spoke to was rude and even a little scary. I'm ashamed that my gift has turned out so poorly and have even asked my friend to cancel her appointment and I'll give her a pedicure at a different salon. n nWeeklyPlus.com said they've received lots of negative feedback about A Perfect Sole and were willing to refund my account for the unused certificates.

"LAZY, UNPROFESSIONAL AND DOWNRIGHT RUDE. Three best words to explain what a horrific experience I had at this Danny's for the first and most definitely last time this last Tuesday. I had just gotten my car back from the shop and decided to get a full interior detail done. I live right off 16th and highland so it was a convenient choice. Well boy was I the fool to think 80 bucks would get me a somewhat decently clean car.to my shock it was actually WORSE then before I went in and wasted my money. They actually took a small contained coffee stain in the back seat and somehow spread the stain all over my cloth seats, w some of the stain moved onto the front passenger seat! It was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car. There was a huge soap stain on the interior windshield, spilled sticky soda stains UNTOUCHED in the drink consul and on top of all of that, they soaped up my tires randomly I didn't even buy an exterior wash which irritated me as I pointed out to one idiot who remarked, ""oh it's to make them look shiny "" with an imbecile grin. HELLOO! Why not focus on the interior and actually get it done RIGHT?!? Utterly pathetic. I am still angry w myself for wasting my hard earned money to this joke of a business. I was so upset I took it back and the men who worked on my car the first time were all there and just stared at me with the rudest glares. Had the guy w the tattoos all over his head and face redo it, who actually did a little better. It's amazing this place is still in business let alone always so busy when I drive by, must be all new timers about to be screwed out of their money.80 dollars down the drain, for a job my two year old daughter could have done better. The raids shouldn't have stopped with the illegals, should have arrested all of the LAZY WORKERS AND STAFF AS WELL!",1
"I had a great 1st visit and I will definitely be back. From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with nfriendly smiles, the restaurant had modern, fresh vibe and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We did the all you can eat which was a deal at 20.95 for anything on the menu except nigiri. That was 4.00 more. The sushi was excellent. Great flavor, well presented by real sushi chefs. My husband and I will deffinately be back!",2
"I am very confused by the negative reviews on here. I have eaten here twice. Once was the 16 course menu once was the 4 course. Both were extremely filling. n nService Exceptional from the moment we walked in. Polite and inviting host team. Our waiters were very knowledgeable and gave excellent recommendations. n nThe Food Ok, everyone agrees the bread cart is the stuff of legends. Everything I had there was done perfectly. Each item on both menus were unique and wonderful. n nThe price Expensive. Very Expensive. Could I have a dining experience as good for less? Yes. Areoles comes to mind. I could get this experience duplicated anywhere else? NO! Truly this place is all about the food, service and overall experience. Very worthwhile.",2
"Love the crust on this pizza. The sauce is decent, cheese is okay, the pepperoni was not the best quality. nMy friend ordered an everything slice, said it was good, just wished so cheese was on the toppings to hold it together.",2
This place has the best orange chicken I have ever tasted. My only regret is that I discovered it so late in my undergrad. The food is made in a respectable amount of time and the owner is so friendly. Call ahead because this place is always packed around dinner time. The free hot tea is fantastic. I like everything about this place and can't wait for the next time I am able to go. Five stars are well deserved.,2
"Everything is ridiculously salty. From the drinks, the bread, the meat. I was definitely not impressed. The plates come garnish free, sauce free, etc. Your plate literally comes in with a big chunk of meat on it. And yeah we ordered sides and sauces that got served to us on our plates. but everything just felt so slapped on. I've been to way better steak houses. The ambience was nice, though, and the waiters were as well.",1
"Went to Jet this past weekend and LOVED it! Mainly because we got a table in the main room. I think since I've gotten older, I spoiled myself with table service everytime I visit Vegas.so we ended up splurging yet again. We had one of the bigger tables on the high stage part and I swear, that's the best seat in the house! You get a big ass couch in the corner and pretty much your own dance floor. Thanks to Janette from The Light Group! She helped us out 2x this year and I called her last minute to help me get a table.she's awesome. The other tables that were on the dancefloor looked to crowded since the dancefloor ended up overflowing into their VIP area. n nAs for the music in the main room.it was really good, although I don't know if it was because I was drunk, but they didn't seem to play a song for more than 30 seconds. Maybe I was just drunk. n nGetting to and from our table to the bathroom was hard though. It was fairly crowded near the bar area so I'd have to snake through the crowd just to use the bathroom. This place actually kind of reminds me of The Bank maybe because they are both The Light Group? . n nAll in all.I had a blast. But what more can you ask for if you have good company, good music and lots of alcohol!",2
"Nicole from Bekins A 1 in Las Vegas talked to my wife. During the first call Nicole seemed sympathetic. When she called my wife back after talking to Jose the driver she was much less so. Essentially she said it was his word against ours and there was nothing she could do. About Jose telling my wife that we could be billed an additional 500 because the truck couldn't get close enough or ""she could take care of them "" Nicole said that was standard practice really extortion is standard? . Of course Jose denied telling my wife that she was ""fucking pissing me off. "" Of course he denied slamming his fist onto our glass topped patio table and of course he denied shouldering me out of the way. Nicole said that if we were so upset at the time and felt so threatened we shoud have called the police. Maybe but it's a sad state when the company you pay almost 3,300 dollars to tells you tough you should have called the cops. n nSo instead of calling the cops we are filing complaints with every agency we can. Jose is nothing but a bully. In light of all the news of spousal abuse and bullying I am surprised that a national company like Bekins would take such behavior so lightly. n nStill waiting for Bekins corporate to resolve this issue. Not sure how you put a dollar on family heirlooms and emotional trauma caused by the bullying, threatening and intimidating Bekins A 1 employee.",1
"It's not often that I write a negative review. I usually try to find the positives and give a place at least an A OK. I can't really do that for this Sammy's, unfortunately. n nFirst, the good. I enjoyed the lobster bisque. It had nice chunks of lobster in it, was served at a nice just barely too hot temperature i.e. room to cool down , and it was creamy and delicious. n nThat was really the only enjoyable part of the meal. We also ordered a garlic shrimp pizza and a balsamic chicken salad. I couldn't really taste much garlic in the pizza. Actually, the pizza overall was just blah. While it wasn't terrible, it certainly didn't match up with pizza I've had previously at other Sammy's. Perhaps the fact that I was at Grimaldi's just a few days ago didn't help things. Grimaldi's owns Sammy's any day of the week. n nAs for the chicken salad, it was a huge portion, but it just seemed like it was drenched in that vinaigrette. I couldn't eat much of it before I had to stop. Although we had a lot of salad left over, neither of us wanted to take any of it to go. Strangely enough, the server didn't even ask if we wanted it to go. Not complaining! n nSpeaking of the wait staff, our server was nice enough, but upon entering, it took a while before there was anyone to greet us. We weren't sure if we should just seat ourselves. That's just a minor thing, but when the overall dining experience is sub par, things like that just stick out. n nWalking into Sammy's, I hadn't eaten all day and was starving. Walking out, I was no longer hungry, but I wasn't satisfied either. It's a shame because I remember enjoying the food at the CMYE a few months ago.",1
"I am addicted to looking fabulous all the time! Carmen makes my lashes long thick and beautiful!

HIGHLY recommend her!",2
"WORST restaurant experience I've EVER had! n nI was so excited to try this place since it's walking distance from my house owned by Heart Soul Caf u00e9 which I really enjoy . This restaurant is going to give Heart Soul a bad reputation if they keep doing business they way they are now. n nWe went this morning with friends that were visiting and about to leave town. The waitress wasn't very attentive which would have been fine if we would have ever gotten our food. We ordered right away since we had 2 infants with us our company wanted to get on the road. We waited 1hour 15 minutes for our food which we never received . After about 30 minutes the waitress completely stopped coming by our table so we had no idea what was taking so long. We all had empty drinks never got a coffee refill or anything. We finally tracked her down to ask what was taking so long was told the kitchen just received a bunch of tickets at once was backed up but all of the food was starting to come up. There were only 4 of us, but for whatever reason tables of 2 were coming after us getting their food. I had a direct view into the kitchen they were SO disorganized. The kitchen staff was fighting yelling at each other loud enough to hear in dining room wait staff was going in yelling at them. It was very unprofessional because it was all in view of our table we were listening to their fighting the whole time we were sitting there. n nWe finally decided after 1 hour 15 minutes absolutely no communication or service from our waitress that we had to leave. The babies who were being angels were starting to get restless our friends were past when they needed to be on the road home. When we told our waitress we were leaving she just said sorry then walked into the kitchen yelled 'don't make the food for table 30'. So after all this time we receive nothing but the word 'sorry' find out that they STILL hadn't even made our food. The restaurant was not near busy enough to even begin to make an excuse for having not even made breakfast that had been ordered over an hour before. Then the fact that nothing was even said to try and make things right when we left. I will be very surprised if this place is in business long. They had an opportunity to be a great neighborhood breakfast place I would have loved for it to be but I will never go back here after the poor service we received on so many levels.",1

"Pretty good Korean food. IMO. n nI lived in Korea Town, Los Angeles for a few years and would walk to our local souju spots and our local Korean BBQ spots with great frequency, so I ate a lot of Korean food. This place is about as good as the Hodori in Los Angeles, which I would rate 3 stars, but this place gets 4 being in the middle of the desert with little else to compare. Hodori, LA is literally surrounded by 100 other KBBQ spots. n nAnyway, service is whatever. nothing special, which is to be expected at a Korean establishment. Sides are pretty good and they are good about refilling them. n nTwo of us usually share one bbq dish and are perfectly full at the end after devouring the meal with all the sides. Oh, and a good boba spot is right next door. kbbq then boba, ftw!",2
"This place recently opened near my house, and I love good breakfast food, so I was hoping for it to be excellent. The first thing I noticed when being seated was that the silverware at our table wasn't entirely clean. Not a good start. n nOverall there weren't too many people in the restaurant 4 or 5 tables while I was there , and there seemed to be quite a few servers. Our drink order was taken quickly, but took a while to fill. I got a coffee, and asked for cream when it came out, which also took longer than I would have expected to get. n nI ordered ""Corned beef hash "", and when the food came out, they brought me a ""Corn huskers "", which is apparently another dish with sausage instead of corned beef. They took the dish back to resolve the issue and apologized for the mistake. When it came back out, I am pretty sure they just exchanged the sausage with corned beef on the plate, but since part of the dish was eggs over easy, by this time the eggs were cold. The dish came with toast, which did not come out with it Even with the delay , and I feel like if I didn't remind the server, I would not have gotten Although I could be wrong . There was also hashbrowns and the corned beef. Neither were bad per say, but they were both definitely on the bland side. n nI feel like each of the issues I had with this place were small, and could have easily been overlooked on its own Except maybe the bland food, but I could have tried something different . The problem was that there were just SO many of them. The one redeeming factor about the place was that everyone was very friendly. When the one redeeming factor about a place is not the food, it is hard to justify giving it another try .",1
Post med school interview. Perfect. All the beer was wonderful and the service was great.,2
"Well, it's outback so you know what you are going to get. It's place was okay the first time, then 2 days later horrible. Everything was sooooooo salty especially the blooming onion, we couldn't even eat it . Then, when the waitress came around and asked how everything was, we told her it was too salty and what did she say? ""Oh, but its so good "" and walked away. Really? That's what you say? They forgot my cousin's horseradish crust on the rib eye steak, then brought it out 15 min later on a plate and slid it onto the steak and it got all crumbled and fell apart . I can't believe it. Lucky for them, there are so few decent places in Surprise people choose to eat at this dump. Never going back.",1

"It makes me beyond happy that they are conscientious of the way a woman's body is presented, which is why they take all of the vibrators out of the box and screen their video selection. The staff will make you feel right at ease and answer any questions that you may have. and if you're still shy they have an amazingly helpful well organized website. I have a friend who hosts those naughty parties, and I always decline because if I have any needs they are met 100 by A Woman's Touch.",2
"Ordered once and not impressed. What really turned me off was when I saw their employees drinking at 1 00 in the afternoon at a local bar just down the street in uniform. I'm not making accusations as they may have been off work, but believe that it's a horrible way to represent your company. Just think it's not very professional",1
"The last time we were here was about ten years ago and we loved it back then so thought we would give it a try again. n nLet's see, Rio buffet how do I hate you, let me count the ways. n nYes, there is a huge selection and is a great place for those with larger groups and different tastes. But, it really ends there. n nI think the line system really sucks. We had a coupon and had to stand in line to the right, while people who were way behind us went up to the credit card side, paid and got seated way before we did. If I had to guess, we had to wait an extra 20 minutes to be seated from those people who were at the back of the line. I don't know how they think this is fair but I guess this is their attempt to keep the line moving. n nWhen we were standing in line, we could see a bunch of empty tables that weren't being cleaned. The line wasn't that long for a Saturday night but the wait was over 45 minutes. Even when we got inside, there were empty tables and still a ton of people in line. n nOur server was just ok, he did bring drinks relatively quickly but when it came to taking our dirty plates away, he was very slow. n nWe really enjoy sushi and the selection here was pathetic and tasted gross. The rice was kind of crunchy, and not really fresh. The chicken I had was very dry and there were a few other things that I tried but didn't finish because they were just not good at all. n nOne thing that was very good was the gelato, and the meat station had a decent and pretty tasty selection. I did have what sort of looked like creme brulee but it was not c.b. I don't know what it was, but the bottom of it was all liquidy and raw! Yuck! n nOverall, I think you can do much better somewhere else. I know some people really enjoy this buffet but my husband and I did not. Yes, there is alot of quantity, but I think the quality for the most part was really lacking.",1

"if you blink your eye, you will miss this little gem, located on the side of a strip mall on west glendale.right across the street from the fry's store at 19th avenue. i have visited this tiny establishment twice now, and yup, size does not count, at least in this case. what does count is the fresh food, and the hospitable service provided by a bald guy like me, but with a goatee that could kill. he is a gentle giant, who is knowledgable about everything on this oaxaqen menu. that's right, do not look for the usual sonoran grub here, you will not find it. but you will find the best fish tacos in town, i believe i was munching on catfish, in a batter that was just perfecly cooked.i have also had the chance to try their bean and cheese burro, shrimp burro and large toasted tortilla with meat, along with black beans, grilled onions. cheese, and other ingredients. the carne asada was lean and tasty. they have agua frescas, one time i tried their coconut and today the horchata., simply one of the best horchata drinks i have ever had. a bit sweet, but so refreshing with the food. a perfect compliment. people were waiting out the door to dine in and when i came to pick up my order, the place was rocking. it is totally understanable that they might miss something, and in my case they forgot to pack my four fish tacos. i called them and they said come on back. they had remade them for me with a 5 dollar bill. i asked the gentle giant why is there a five dollar bill on top of the box.and he replied,'for the extra as you had to use to come back, of course "". of course, like any other place would have done that. this is a keeper, and hope when you want to try something a bit different from the usual mexican fare, you headto 1830 west glendale the northeast corner of glendaleand 19th ave.or call 864 2747. they are open tuesday thru sat from 10 9pm. you will thank me for this. oh, did i mention the prices. the most expensive item on the menu was the multi topped tortilla, probably a 12 inch diameter, chocked with goodies.enough for two people with large appetites. tomorrow nite heading to try the vietnamese place that opened on 7th st.called rice paper. i will let you know in a few days how that went. meanwhile, tacos atoyac is the atomic bomb when it comes to great mexican food. salud!",2

"At first I believed this to be a very nice motel despite my initial misgivings. No one was the front desk but once in the room I saw that was quite nice, well equipped, and very clean . that is until I found the used condom on the floor. I ignored that however and still had a very nice stay though I could not help but notice that, because there are actually two properties right next to each other, communication between the two buildings and staff members was very bad. That was not to become apparent until after I left and tried to contact the management about an item I accidentally left in the room. After 3 calls I gave up and I also gave up on this facility.",1

We ordered an original lobster roll, lobster mac and lobster grilled cheese. Unfortunately, we weren't really impressed! The lobster roll was inconsistent in flavor. Some bites were pretty good, others were eh. It was also pretty small! should not be called ""large "" . The lobster mac was, sad to say. Bland and runny. Couldn't really taste the lobster and it looked like Mac and cheese, but the flavor of the cheese was almost nonexistent. Definitely would like it to be more creamy and rich. Finally, the lobster grilled cheese was actually the best of the three, but was far from phenomenal. The grilled bread was good but was mushy. It didn't have that crisp you expect from a grilled sammy. I told my girl, the best part of my meal was my beer. n nI read an earlier post about this place. It stated ""if you don't like your money, eat here. "" I wanted to find out for myself, but about 40 poorer, I definitely should have taken that yelper's advice! Don't say we didn't warn you!",1
"Warning Undisclosed Relish Situation URS n nThe food here is nothing compared to the Carnegie Deli in New York, and the service was far too slow. It took an hour to do a simple lunch on a Saturday, and most of that involved sitting at the table waiting for our server. n nI dislike their pickles, which were too salty yet flavorless. The latkes were the opposite bland with no salt. Also, my tuna salad's bread wasn't toasty and it had a URS. Relish! Why wouldn't they forewarn me? WHY? I HATE relish! I have never had a tuna salad with relish in my life, and I aim to never have one again. Maybe it would have been better if I ordered something else, but then again, how would I have known? n nSign the petition. Ban all URSs in this country!",1
My 18 month old son has diarreah 3 days still after going here and I as well the second day. I passed up a few other Mexican restaurants on the way here thinking I can trust the quality more since it's across the street from UNLV but an uneducated assumption I must admit. If you are used to cleanliness and quality I highly recommend avoiding,1
"I was SUPER excited to eat here. but left unimpressed. Sad face. I must say, the Bellagio buffet is hands down the best buffet in Vegas. Sorry Wynn buffet! n nHUGE selection of items. Salads, cheeses with crackers, pastas, fish, ribs, turkey, chicken, prime rib, mashed potatoes, crab legs NOT KING CRAB , sushi, desserts, etc. the layout is VERY nice and the restaurant is VERY clean. Our server was super busy and wasn't as on it as I would have liked. but eh, what can you do? n nI normally try a tiny bit of the things that look pleasing to me and then go back for what I really liked. I ended up liking the mango salsa mahi mahi VERY tender mahi mahi , the mashed potatoes yummy buttery goodness , and the prime rib prime rib is prime rib . Nothing exciting. I tried almost EVERY dessert. Literally. Hell I'm paying 44 for dinner, I should be able to! I liked ONE. Yes. ONE. And it was OKAY. I can't even remember what it was. n nSorry Wynn buffet. I won't be back. I'll be chillin at the Bellagio buffet!",1
"Guys don't go here on Lunch hour it feels like worse then a costco on saturday. Too crowded, if you have ample time go for it. Food is same as any Pita Jungle corner.

"From the reviews I thought this was going to be a great experience. I was at work looking at yelp for food ideas and this place looked good. Normally I go to Archi's or I go to Satay but this is closer to me. So I place my order for panang curry w beef in the lunch special and get an egg roll and wow it was only 6.55. I get there and the place looks somewhat raggedy but the woman at the front desk was super friendly. I get my food, awkwardly she doesn't give me change but I make my way back to the office. Here's where the issues begin. n nThe serving size of the curry was so small. Like not just lunch special small but like ""am I really supposed to get full from this small "". I ordered a spice level 5 on a scale from 1 10 and it was like an 8. I can handle spice and I like spice but that was excessive since I wasn't expecting it. The beef was akin to beef jerky and was boiled with 0 flavor. At Satay they have shredded beef integrated into the panang to give it a different texture and and great flavor. This tasted like nothing. The curry was ok in flavor but very soupy. The egg roll was random in flavor with no appetizing dipping sauce. The fake sweet chili sauce had vinegar weird . Overall I had a flavor profile in my head that this didn't meet and I was still hungry. Blah",1
"So it was the Friday morning of the AOD Invasion, and I was faced with the decision of either relaxing at the luxurious Encore adult pool or party my ass off at Liquid. Memories of girls getting carted off in wheelchairs still reminded me that it takes a bit of endurance and party swagger to get through a day at this place. I checked with Team Encore, and they wanted to. PARTAI. So I had no option but to tough it out. n nI texted Hali that we are coming down and she said no probs. We walked through the corridors of Aria and through the hotel pool and found ourselves at this massive line that ran around the concrete wall. The last time I came here on a Thursday there was actually no line, so my first thought is that 2011 Liquid is more popping then ever. Boy was I ever right! n nI got up to the front and waved Hali down. She quickly had security put aside the ropes. She asked me how many and also how does the daybed next to the DJ booth sound? We all thought that was a great location. Also our JC member Mood director of Liquid Pearce Cleaveland will be working there the whole day to cater to all our partying needs. n nWe got in and got settled, and our daybed had a great view of all the mayhem that was going on in the pool. Without having a chance to even put my sunscreen on, Pearce came by with a round of shots for our entire group. Some of the girls couldn't finish the shot so I had to handle it for them. n nI got a chance to roam around and hang out with the AOD members, and everyone was having a good time. Pearce kept giving shoutouts to the AOD crew at the pool and random strangers saw my AOD dogtag and would come up to me and ask what it stood for. ""Bro is this YOUR party? "" ""Yes this is our party, and we are taking over. "" n nI don't think I ever got a chance to make it to my daybed without stumbling around this place. Pearce stopped me to do a shot could've been 5 shots, it was a solid pour from a bottle . People were snapping pics. ""What the first pic didnt go through? "" ""Do it again! "" ""Shit "" So I had do this shot twice http a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net hphotos ak snc6 247987 202342743143052 100001019834956 520740 3390033 n.jpg n nAll in all it was a great day. If we needed an umbrella at our daybed, Pearce made it happen. If we needed more alcohol Pearce made it happen. If we needed someone to get already clinically insane people to get more crazy, Pearce made it happen by giving shoutouts over the mic to all the AOD members. n nI knew it was 5pm when I saw members passed out at random places and getting escorted out. People were dancing then falling over chairs and I had to pick them up. I started drinking water so I can save myself and not be a causality in the evening. The party doesn't stop at the pool for an AOD member, but I can't say Liquid didn't do a number on me. n nShoutout to Hali Tendler host at Liquid for making this location happen http a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net hphotos ak snc6 255024 202006046510055 100001019834956 518394 4043552 n.jpg nAlso Pearce Cleaveland for keeping the party going.

"I was really torn about closing my account here because the service is always friendly and helpful and most Chase branches have a very modern, clean, efficient layout that makes me comfortable and feel like my money or lack thereof is being looked after. n nHowever as I continue my crusade to shift as much spending and financial transacting as possible to Arizona business, banking is at the top of my list so I have switched to Arizona State Credit Union. n nWhile I would love to see everyone support local financial institutions I understand that a national bank is better for some people.

"Good food but horrible service. They're slow and unorganized. I rate it a 2 because the food is good otherwise it'd be a 1 at best. But the service is not about the customer. We saw what seemed to be a manager poke their head out, see its busy and disappear please.",1
"A wannabe classy, expensive steak house, but lacked convincibility and genuineness. More than just a little pretentious, the well dressed greeter and manager lacked any authenticity or professionalism. Our waiter Romeo knew nothing about steak, or cuts of meat. When asked about the difference between two cuts of meat on their menu, he responded with ""they're all muscle! "" Yes, he basically yelled at me for asking the question, and seemed visibly frustrated that he was ignorant and lacked the skill to serve in his position as a steak expert. I decided then that we would not be spending anything too much, and we ordered appetizers and small grilled steak salads, which were average at best. They never offered us another glass of wine and the atmosphere seemed rushed and cheap. I don't recommend this place and we will not be visiting there again. Perhaps if they lowered their prices to match their level of friendliness and service, it might be worth another visit. Not all was bad, however.Thomas was another waiter who was welcoming and friendly, so if you are lucky enough to get Thomas, you might be able to salvage a respectable evening. We, unfortunately, did not enjoy this experience.",1
"I wanted badly to support this store because it is very convenient to where I live. There were three employees that I could see when I visited, yet apparently only one knew how to properly apply eye liner. When I try a new liner I like to see how they work with the product first. The one person who could help was helping someone else which was not the fault of the store but what struck me is how unfriendly he was. I've worked with him numerous times previously and bought a lot from this store. He could have at least pretended to be friendly whether he recognized me or not. Very uncomfortable atmosphere. I'd rather support a department store at this point.",1
Didnt know what to expect. Absolutely loved it.,2
"I hate to say it, but after staying here a couple of times a girl can get spoiled! Also as a side note, while you're there you gotta watch Le Reve, I'm a huge fan of Vegas shows! One of the best things about the Le Reve theater is there no such thing as a bad seat in the house. I still watch it every other time I go to Vegas n nI have to admit when Wynn first opened their doors, everything was BEAUTIFUL and everything is STILL beautiful, but I can see a slight aging since the last few times I was there. It's not that bad if you compare their aging process to another strip hotel. n nI can't wait until they finish Encore! I'm so excited!",2

I can tell you how to make a good pie. but not using any garlic or half that cause the other pizza we got was bland. n nWe also ordered a meat trio esk pizza The sauce well what sauce I could find was dolloped on sort of like the ricotta cheese on the other pizza, leaving gaps on non sauced areas near the crust making the crust actually taste burnt rather then tasting fresh. n nI was actually quite disappointed to be honest. The white pizza was meh. also the pizza sauce itself had no flavor lacking salt, even Italian Seasonings. n nI hope they see this. 40 something bill",1
I wish I could give a negative star rating to this restaurant. The food is way over priced and the show the chef put on wasn't even average. And to top it all off my wife and I both got sick from the food. Don't think I'll be patronizing this establishment again,1
"This is probably the least well equipped Goodwill in the area. I had expected more at a location in Shadyside, but the selection here is sub par particularly for men the only good item that I've bought here was a sweater for an ugly sweater party. This is surprising, because the drop off center in the back is particularly hopping. Every time I drop off a bag they hardly have any room in the storage facility behind the building. I don't understand the disconnect. maybe they're shipping items over to another location because the store is too small to host everything in the front? Either way, I would go down to the South Side location for your Goodwill needs, because they've got it going on.",1

Do not buy tires from Fletcher. They do not warrant the tires they sell. I bought a set of tires with a hazard warranty and the tires began to split. The tires were manufactured by Firestone. I researched Firestone tires and they have had major lawsuits and Ford actually dropped them as a supplier just last year. Firestone had been with Ford for 94 years. Fletcher would not cover my tires which I purchased less than 2 1 2 years ago because of the splitting of the tire. I will NEVER buy another tire from Fletcher and neither should you.,1

"Very disappointed with this shop. I did buy my bridal gown here which was beautiful, but the experience was definitely not what I had hoped for. I truly felt like each employee I came across, with the exception of one I wish I could remember her name did not want to be at their job. They pretty much seemed like they would rather be anywhere else. I felt completely rushed when trying on gowns, which sucks because it's quite a big decision when you are spending that amount of money for a very important day. Costume jewelry is overpriced, alterations are overpriced. Go somewhere else. My friend had her wedding gown altered here and they screwed it up twice! I don't know how it is at other bridal shops, but I think it's shitty that you are not allowed to return anything only exchange and it's a crime how long they estimate it will take to get the gown you order, especially considering they are a huge chain!",1
"If you are looking for a healthy breakfast spot, this is the place.

"This Upper Midwest bagel shop is a tempered version of what you'd get on Manhattan's Upper West side. Since NYC bagel shops are the gold standard and obvious benchmark for comparison, I figured I'd contrast the Gotham experience with what you'd get at one of the well known shops in Manhattan I live in Madison and travel to NY regularly for family and work . n nMenu Caper cream cheese, lox, capicola, matzo ball soup. this place is authentic. A true NY bagel shop is going to be a little more like a deli with whitefish and other kosher items. That said, Gotham's menu is more complex and if you are just talking bagels it actually has a wider variety. There are several predefined egg sandwiches and lunch options. An espresso machine and fresh juices are available to wash things down. n nFood Gotham's bagels are a little less chewy than most traditional NY bagels. They are also slightly smaller. That said, the bagels taste great and have a perfect consistency when toasted. n nThe egg sandwiches are probably the default choice for someone looking to cure a hangover. They aren't bad, but they look more appealing on the menu than they actually taste. Cappicola, egg, and cheese sounds amazing, but the bagel is always a little too hard and the egg is cooked more than I'd like. This is on par with what I've had East of the Hudson river. n nThe real staple here is a bagel with cream cheese. I have a couple regular choices everything bagel with veggie cream cheese onion bagel with caper cream cheese, lox, and tomato. The only difference and potential gripe is that a bagel shop in NY is going to give you a lot more cream cheese and lox. This isn't a bad thing since I usually end up scraping off a lot of extra cream cheese in that case, but I wouldn't mind getting a slightly heartier server than Gotham currently provides. n nPrice the bagels are pricey compared to what you might pay at a chain or grocery store, particularly in Madison. That said, a bagel with cream cheese and lox is 8 at Gotham, and roughly 13 at Tal Bagels in Manhattan. n nService most people working there seem like stereotypical New Yorkers, particularly the owner and the guys working the grill and bagel oven. This oddly feels MORE authentic than what you usually get in NYC, where Hispanics dominate the labor force in the food industry. n nThe people working the counter are sort of rude without doing anything that is specifically rude. Perhaps it's just the lack of the smile or any attempt at smalltalk. I think they are playing into Midwestern perceptions of what service in NY is supposed to be like, even though it's not really in line with reality at least for a bagel shop . n nThere is a decent wait to get your food if it is even remotely busy. If Gotham bagels was located in Manhattan, this would be it's Achilles heel. As another reviewer noted, the orders are served sequentially, so even if you get something simple, they aren't going to touch it until they finish that order of 6 custom bagels for the coasties that were in line in front of you. This isn't Brueggers or Eintein's and you have to have that expectation going in or you are going to get very frustrated. n nAtmosphere the dark wood tables and stools have a nice urban feel to them, and overall it's cleaner and nicer than most authentic delis or bagel shops that I've seen in NY. That said, the only real ""character "" here is from the images of subway stations and other NY landmarks on the wall. Some people might say that it's gimmicky to have pictures of another city up in a restaurant, but they could have gone a lot further with the whole NY theme and thankfully have kept it pretty low key. n nConclusion great location, best bagels I've had outside of New York, and a great breakfast brunch for under 10. This is definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a solid way to start the day or recover from the day before.",2
Service here was horrendous. Here's what happened n n1. Found one inch glass piece in our food. n2. Takes 10 minutes before the waitress comes to apologize n3. Does NOT comp anything on our bill including the dish with the glass. n4. Food was dry and not very good sangria was ok n5. Owner finally comes out to apologize and gives us a gift certificate.with an expiration date of the very next day. n nIn sum it was likely the worst service I have experienced completely insincere. Do not go here.,1
Would not recommend this salon to minorities because of racist workers. I love the clients at the salon but behind the scenes its very unprofessional and unsanitary however I still wish Peter and Holy much success in all they do.,1
"Ok, I gave Graze a 4 because for brunch, they're probably about a 3. But the Graze burger is a surefire 5. I'd skip brunch here and just save room for dinner. The graze burger is honestly one of the better things I've ever tasted.I mean. n nfresh ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye short ribs, caramelized onions, Worcestershire cabernet jus, Swiss Emmental compound butter, SarVecchio sesame brioche, with fries aioli Modify to GF DF n nFor brunch, I was fooled into getting the pub burger, thinking it was the Graze burger. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. The pub burger is just a burger. The Graze burger is otherworldly. The beet salad is also really nice. The curds are probably top 5 curds in Madison, and I LOVE the truffle popcorn. n nOk so for brunch, I've had the chicken fried steak, and others have gotten the pub burger and the corned beef hash. All of them were pretty good, but the portions aren't too large. The chicken fried steak is definitely a favorite of mine, but I wouldn't hate if it were a little bigger. n nIt's pretty tough to get a table at Graze you should always have someone go at least 30 minutes ahead of when you want to be seated to put in your name they don't take call ahead reservations . One nice thing is that they'll take your number and text you when your table is ready, so you can explore the area around the capitol while you wait. Also the people watching from the tables is top notch. I usually will wait a few more minutes to be seated against the windows. Last thing is that the wait staff comes off as a little pretentious. I've found that it's very hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone really relatable and nice, and other times there will be people that I imagine rolling their eyes at me as soon as they turn around. Also what's up with the tiny dishes of ketchup?! I'll take the full bottle, please.",2
"One thing I must emphasize is this restaurant's goi cuon shrimp, pork and lettuce with rice noodles wrapped in rice paper . They make the best ones I've had to date they're larger than most places and, most importantly, they use the more expensive, thinner rice paper. Why is that important? The thicker rice paper used in most of the other restaurants are not only cheaper, but much easier to roll. The thinner cut is much harder to roll, because if you're not fast, the paper sticks to itself. From a visual outlook, the thinner ones are much clearer and you cannot only see the contents more clearly, it gives a ""fresher "" appearance to the rolls. But most important is the taste much less ""crunchy "" than with thicker skins and you taste much more of the contents than in other rolls, where the thick skin steals some of the taste by ""overpowering "" the shrimp, pork, etc. The real test comes with what I call the ""refrigerator test "". As I live quite a ways from this restaurant, I usually order an extra 5 of these rolls to take home and have for breakfast during the week. Now, refrigerators are not a friend of these rolls, no matter who makes it. However, other restaurants' rolls get crunchy and stale by the very next morning. In contrast, the rolls from Dong A tend to take a much longer time to ""deteriorate "" the skin doesn't get tough, but the shrimp starts to ""go "" and there's a slimy feeling to the roll . Since we're talking about a sitting time of five days or so, it is naturally very desirable to have something that won't taste like you're eating shrimp in an old newspaper.",2

"Zinc Bistro is a must if you visit Kirland Common, this restaurant is no stranger to awards and recognition. nWhy I love it, nFour and a half Stars, So close to Five. I worked at Trio in Chicago and really enjoyed learning about French fine dinning. Notice how many tables are served and how much detail is given to service and especially to each dish.

"This is the worst dealer that I have ever worked with! I thought I was moving up when I sold my Honda and bought the BMW. Not the case! Once you own the car, the service department could care less about your needs. It feels that you are bothering them when you bring your vehicle in. I would steer clear from this dealer. I had issues with my vehicle prior to warranty expiration. When the item broke, 3 day after warranty expired, they would not fix and wanted nothing to do with me. I will never give my business to Chapman again!",1
"This is the second restaurant we have gone to solely on the basis of Yelp reviews, and the second time that Yelp has given us a new favorite spot. If you're looking for a casual sushi place in the West Valley that won't break the bank, this is the place to go. Rather than feeling like an extravagant meal, this really was casual sushi. But, it was GOOD. n nEvery order we had was done well, flavored well, and presented carefully. The service was friendly without being overbearing. At one point the waitress saw me struggling with my chopsticks and brought me over a little helper and put it on for me. n nAs for the prices, Sushi Catcher has an all the time happy hour menu. Standards like California rolls are 3 6 apiece, for generous portions. Non happy hour specialty rolls were a bit more expensive, but the portions were a little larger too. n nNot sure if it was because it was our first time, or because we plowed through 6 orders of sushi, but the waitress brought us a complimentary mochi ice cream for dessert. Now that we've had it, we will definitely order it again. Calling this ice cream isn't quite right. It was balls of creamy custard type ice cream encased in what tasted like a gummy shell but turned out to be a rice shell of some sort. I have no idea what kind of wizardry was involved, but I'm a fan. n nThis place is pretty nondescript on the outside. It is on in the shopping plaza on the north side of Bell but the outside only says ""Sushi "". You have to get right up to the door to see ""sushi catcher "". The place is small and probably would only seat 30 people or so, but was squeaky clean and all of the fish and other ingredients looked and smelled fresh. Several of the people who were there looked to be regulars.",2

"The wings are awesome, I'll give them that. But it's in a bad location and reminds you that bar in movies where something is about to go down. n nMy advice, get the wings to go and get out while the getting is good.",1
"Excellent Korean food by Arizona standards. Side dishes are great and the staff is polite. The menu could use some work as people completely new to Korean food may not know what Yukgaejang is, but for those who are already familiar this is the best Korean food I've had in the valley and I've been to all the major ones, Chodang, Hodori, Gogi etc . Highly recommended, don't miss this place! Got the Spicy Chicken Filets dinner plate, very tender and delicious with the side dishes.",2
"Monta Monta. Do you want to Monta?. F k yeah I wanna Monta. A friend of mines mention to me about this place when she was in Vegas. So the next time I went to Vegas, I decided to try this place out cause I love good ramen. Line here sucks but it is well worth it. The first time I had this place I was blown away at how scrumdidilumpcious. I decided to go back to this place again the next day just so my friends can try it out also. Miso ramen was excellent. The pork was so tender that it melts in your mouth. Same with the egg. The only thing I would complain about is the gyoza. They tasted like the one you brought in the frozen good section at the store. Stay away from the gyoza and you would definitely give this place 5 stars.",2
"Walked in and it was pretty busy, that's always a good sign. Was shown a table and then was left alone for 20 minuets! We had to ask for place settings and water and the tables and floor were a bit dirty. I was about to say ""let's go "" when our server came and took our order. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes without strawberries and my friend ordered strawberry pancakes. Our order came with eggs and hash browns and that was pretty good but the RV pancakes fell short on flavor. nOverall, I think that I'll try a few more places before I head back to The Griddle.",1
"As a vegetarian and I always a little concerned when trying new restaurants, but this was hands down the best meal I have ever eaten, everything was perfect. I went with a date and we both ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu. n nThe antipasto plate was divine, they only cook with local in season vegetables so it was fun to give me taste buds something a little different think parsnips and fennel . That was followed by a salad with fresh grapefruit, local artisan cheeses, grilled vegetables, cauliflower tartar with fried capers, red onion and grilled bread , marinated seasonal vegetables, cheese gnudi similar to gnocchi with romanesco and spicy crushed tomatoes and then finished with an incredible dessert. n nThe ambiance was great for a date but would be perfect for a group as well. Although I wouldn't recommend it for children. If it had been warmer we would have eaten outside in their pecan groves. There are also outside fire pits to warm up around. n nI cannot wait until I get the opportunity to dine here again, it is now my new favorite!",2
Terrible service. Food was ok. Not worth it.,1
"The ice cream is excellent but a little pricey. The service is less than stellar. Our daughter bought a cone and discovered a hair in it. When we returned to the counter and informed the employee that sold us the cone she actually said ""We've been getting that a lot lately "". Great! n nAlso, if you order anything to be picked up later, like a birthday cake or cupcakes, make sure you call before you go to pick it up as they seem to be less than organized with their orders. n nI gave them a 2 star rating based on the excellent flavors. it should have been at least a 4.5 with some attention to customer service.",1
"Oh so good after a long night of partying and drinking! Its off the strip, but very easy to get to by driving. Not sure how much it would be to cab, but its worth leaving the strip and not paying 20 for food. This place is very clean and quite big, so the there usually isnt a wait. Most of the waiters are latin which impresses me cuz they knew all the terminology of vietnamese food. Service was fast and efficient. In and out quickly and best of all.they have clear noodles! My fave!",2
"What a wonderful club! It's located inside of the beautiful Wynn. When you first walk down, you walk into the ""Red Light Special "" room. Hey now. It serves as the club's lounge. You can hang out there if you want to just chill and relax. Descend down another flight of stairs and you have entered the main dance floor. And a HUGE dance floor at that. But what catches your eye is the beautiful outside waterfall towards the back of the room. They play great music but the place is so crowded that you are entirely soaked by the time that you leave. I went late July last year, so yeah, it was HOT! We went outside by the waterfall to cool off and the temp. was the same out there as it was inside! Unlike Tao, there was enough room to dance and I had an absolute blast! I'm so gonna go back there.",2
"I'm not really sure if some of the other reviewers ate at the same place that I did but I think Tsuki is great. The sushi is good, fresh and well priced. the hibachi is very tasty. the people are nice and welcoming and genuinely happy to see you. I've eaten here several times and plan to keep going. The 20 off they offer on dinners over 25 is a really great deal.",2
"We contracted Simply Cinema to shoot our wedding several few weeks before the big day. All went well during the filming of the wedding, and their videographers were friendly. nTowards the end of the transaction a few weeks later, we had several concerns. We purchased a package that included DVDs of our wedding footage. We were sent a USB drive that contained files of footage, not the continuous wedding footage we paid for. We contacted them right away their communication could've been much better.took forever to return calls, they responded by email when we specifically asked for a call, etc . When we finally were able to get a hold of them, they said that package we purchased was no longer available, which meant they did not make that DVD anymore. This was the ONLY reason we paid for a videographer, to have a DVD full of wedding footage! Their excuse for the change they didn't ""do that kind of technology anymore. "" The kicker, is that they never let us know the package we paid for several months before had ""changed. "" So we were stuck with a USB drive of files of footage, not a DVD of continuous, chronilogical order time line of events like we paid a lot for. They said they couldn't make it right, because they didn't have the capability to make a full length DVD.what decade are they living in? n nBottom line they changed the package without telling us, didn't do anything to help us make it right and make the customer feel good about their expensive purchase. They sent us some blank DVDs so we could make the transfer ourselves. Gee, thanks. I'm glad we paid you a lot of money to do this for us, and in the end you didn't do it! We won't be recommending you to anyone.",1
"We were lost on our way to Las Vegas. I grabbed the Yelp app to find a place to eat and found Vogue. I was able to book a table through Open table via the Yelp app which was very convenient. n nWe had the Vogue Burger and Vogue Salad. Both were fantastic. The blue cheese on the burger was bold, but the sweet glazed onions tamed the overall flavor and was surprisingly delicious. The salad used a very textured lettuce I hadn't tried before, it was different but tasty. I enjoyed had a Petite Sirah by the glass which was amazing, so smooth. n nThe restaurant had outdoor seating which was very nice and comfortable, but it was a cold night. The wait staff quickly fixed the temperature by turning on an overhead heater. n nWe will definitely stop here again on our way to Las Vegas!",2
"I love the Nile! The staff here are always friendly and actually care for the attendees. Any show that i go to I'm always hoping that it's at the Nile! Great venue, great people, always make great unforgettable memories!",2
"This place opened a few months ago, so we decided to try it. We were there on a Tuesday night and they were full, but not on a wait. The waitress we had was very cocky, chewing gum and just unfriendly. Our good order came quickly, in fact our drinks didn't come for 15 minutes after our food. The turkey sandwich I ordered was terrible. I ordered another drink, but the waitress never brought it. The longer we sat there, the more frustrated I got. A different waitress cleared our table and I asked her for our check. Waited another 10 mins before I got up and found a manager, explained to him our circumstance, he said 'she's busy in the bar'. We were there for hour and 45 mins. We won't be back.",1
"We had dinner here on 8 31 14.the meal was spectacular! I wish I could give it 10 stars! We each had the rib cap steak with foie gras, it was cooked to perfection. From the wine that was recommended to the special chocolate liquor spoons served with our espresso.it was first class, decadent and service was exemplary. nAdrian was our server and Tracey was our host both of them took great care of us! n nChef Ramsey you should be proud.this is what a good good doesn't even sound ""good "" enough restaurant is, your staff is excellent here!",2
"I'm with you Jasmine! I had that nasty one in 2005. It tasted so flat and bitter. Totally from another country! I was hoping they would change it, but I guess not! I love the coke floats here.to my memory, they cost 2.50 and are totally satisfying on a HOT vegas night. Come here and take a pic with the big polar bear! so cute! They also have these flavorings that you can add to your coke. I tried the chocolate one. My friends didn't really like it, but I did! it was a great twist on a classic beverage. This place is awesome!",2
"Sorry, but no. n nI wanted to like this place so much my friend moved right around the corner and I had the highest of hopes this could be a regular place. That will not be happening. n nLet's start off with the menu. Mine had different prices printed than my friend's. The menus had identical printing volumes at the bottom. We pointed this out to our waiter, who said ""Which ever is higher priced is right! "" and we were all ""Oh, we weren't trying to get cheaper food, just thought you should be aware because people usually want to know what they are paying for food. "" n nWhich brings me to service I wanted to like our waiter, but he was kind of weird. I don't know if pushy is the right word, but he wasn't congenial and almost seemed annoyed by us not knowing what we wanted the second we arrived. I mean, for real he handed us menus and was like ""do you know what you'd like to order? "" when we very obviously didn't. He left and came back literally 45 seconds later. After we ordered, my friend's drink sat empty for 20 minutes before we saw the waiter again. n nI guess here is where I should note that this place was not at all busy, so the drink sitting empty is really inexcusable. Also, for 10 people being in the space, it was incredibly loud. I get that might be a product of the space, but what MIGHT help is not having several TVs blaring different things. n nAnd now food. I got pot roast fries. They danced right on the ""Wow, this is really salty "" and ""Wow, this is totally inedible "" line. My friend's parents joined us and I didn't want to be fussy and hold them up, so I said nothing. Had it just been my friend and I, they would have been sent back. I rarely think things are overly salted these fries appeared to be coated in coarsely cracked sea salt. When I got near to the bottom, I realized that the gravy on the fries had basically made the paper in the basket disintegrate or dissolve that's when I just stopped who wants paper with their fries? Not me. n nAnd now for the TMI portion of the evening. I have a pretty strong stomach with no regular digestive issues. I had the absolute worst indigestion, gas, and bloating after eating here. Worse than when I was 9 months pregnant eating pickled jalapenos on eggs covered in hot sauce with black beans on the side. Seriously. They use something in their food that is not kind to tummies. Or at least mine.",1
"I am somewhat conflicted on my feelings of The Henry. I've been there several times, and was pleased with most aspects. The lunch menu has some nice choices, and I was turned onto the Kale and Apple salad by one of the staff. Admittedly, I eat far too much crap, so adding the salad to my diet a few times a week is probably a good thing. Service for lunch was solid, no complaints. n nAnother time I sat on my lunch break and did some work on their WiFi, which was a bit slow, but hey, it's free. I ordered a coffee that was quite good, and the employee was more than happy to chat with me about some of the nicer cars in the parking lot. Good dude, and made good coffee. Definitely a fan of the coffee bar there. n nThe liquor menu is pretty diverse, and has some harder to find stuff on it, which is nice. They're lacking both Macallan and Highland Park though, which are must haves as far as I am concerned. I had a glass of the Yamazaki 18 there recently, which had nice flavor and complexity, but I'm definitely still a scotch guy. Nevertheless, the rise of Japanese whiskey is still relatively new, so it was cool to see it on the menu. n nOne thing that does bother me is that the higher ups appear to ride the employees pretty hard. My friends and I were getting lunch, and all noticed that the staff seemed to tense up when a manager would walk by. My server was killing it with our service, but I noticed he got pulled aside and chewed out for something. I've seen a few other people get grilled too. Granted, I don't work there or know what it's like for the managers, but the added tension when they're hovering around can be a bit uncomfortable. They've got a solid staff, let them do their thing. n nI've generally been a fan of most of the Fox Concepts, but The Henry just seems like it's run too tight for my taste. The place has a ton of potential though. n nOh, and apparently breakfast ends at 10 and lunch doesn't start until 11, and in between neither menu is technically available to order from. You're essentially in food limbo for an hour. Who the hell though that was a good idea?",1
Portions are huge. Def advise sharing. The ultimate dish is the chicken n waffles!,2
"Best hidden gem of Las Vegas! n nFree entrance, a vast plethora of vintage games, and open late. You will be taken aback when you see some of the game they had restored and you had probably seen as a child years ago. n nThey keep it old school with the prices, as well. 25 75 cents per game as opposed to 1 2 games you see these days in other arcades. n nA must see when visiting Las Vegas",2
"I was NOT impressed! Give me In N Out over this any day! Thank goodness I was dressed in costume and received 15 off my order. Their doorway advertisement for Halloween week weekend . My burger didn't look burnt but it sure tasted burnt. The amount of cheese was poor 1 slice for .99, and was pretty tasteless. The pickle relish combo I found to be rather ICK! and the fries tasted just like Burger Kings. I wanted Onion Rings, but they didn't have any. n nI am aware you can build it the way you wish, however being my first time there and probably my last, I was that unimpressed I felt I should try the sandwich as it should be. n nSierra, the one employee, was the best thing in that whole place! She was GREAT! She brought our food and asked if we needed anything, we asked for Ketchup, which instead of just telling us where it was since it's a serve yourself, she went over and got it for us. She didn't need to do that. She went above and beyond her job just to make our experience more enjoyable. She had a smile on her face the whole time, which was nice compared to the rest of the employees. Give that girl a raise and promotion! n nOh, and besides the 10 minute wait in line, because the employees including the manager on duty lack of knowledge of the 15 off deal they clearly have advertised on a sign as you enter Fatburger was ridiculous! First they argued with us about the 15 off, until the employee asked the manager, who then gave us the stink eye, until she waddled her butt to the doorway. Then without any word walked to the back where the line continued to grow as we waited, and waited. She returned and completed the orders after calling her manager asking how to input the discount probably waking the manager up, but good for them if they don't train their employees properly . n nI will not be going back to this Fatburger that's for sure, and will probably not eat at another again. Was highly dissatisfied. n nNo comparison with In N Out.",1
"First of I have to say that I like the food at Steak and Shake, but the service is just terrible! I don't care about waiting in line to get in. it happens there and should be expected if you go. What I'm talking about is getting your drinks and knowing that once the food is there good luck getting a refill on your drink! Im also talking about it having to wait almost 20 minutes in line to pay because the manager can't be bothered to come up and help so we are sent off into the take out line only to wait again and when the manager finally comes up to clear the line all she says is ""it happens "". I then asked for a corp customer she replies ""it only going to come to me anyway "". Seriously, if thats the way you want to treat people I wont be back. Its a shame because the food was good!",1
"This 'bucks is right down the street from my house, so whenever I get a caffeine fix, I take a little walk to my local Starbucks. It does suck that this, Pei Wei and SideBar took over the fierce Emerald Lounge, but business is business. nAnyway, in no time at all the staff knew my name and my drink. Does that mean I go there too much or they're just that good? I vote for the latter, and on top of it these guys know the right way to make my drink. I've tried to explain my drink to other baristas in other stores from Phoenix to LA to Vegas to San Francisco jeez I visit Starbucks too much , and they never get it quite right. nAlso the place is usually spotless, even when it's crowded, which makes for a great hang out spot.",2
"My new Husband and I went to Pub Grill because we LOVE Gordon Ramsay and watch hells kitchen master chef every season! The waiter, Taylor, was EXTREMLEY helpful to us in picking out the best entree's to have. I had the Grilled Lamb Burger YUMM! My husband had the Grilled NY Strip DELISH! Our server overheard that we had asked for Ranch dressing and instead of leaving me to use the blue cheese that was brought to me he brought me a number of options one of which included a cheese dip which anyone who knows me knows I cannot say no to cheese dip ! Everything was amazing I cant wait to go back one day!",2
Ordered their special portobello wrap and there was hardly any Porto in it. Probably not even half of one. It was mostly spinach and the sun dried tomato was so hard I couldn't eat it. Plus it took 25 mins for two items to come out. They lost my service.,1
"Not impressed with this shop at all. Their product offering is sub par and customer service is awful. The only reason why we stopped by here is because we were referred by an employee from another SuperPawn.she said that they had a nice selection of silver jewelry, which was a lie. The silver jewelry selection here was minimal. n nReturn Factor 5 ",1
"Should've read yelp reviews before venturing here. Like one yelper mentioned the place smells funny. Was thinking of walking out but we didn't. My friend ordered the burrito. There was nothing special about it. It was pretty big though. I ordered the carne verde too much verde sauce my pork was swimming in it. It tasted like the bottled verde sauce. Accompanied with Spanish rice and refried beans. Nothing really stood out. I wasn't looking for fine dining. Place is dingy and dirty. Our food came out about 5 seconds after ordering it, ok, I'm exaggerating it was more like 5 mins which made me believe their food was pre made and probably nuked. Really not worth it and a waste of stomach space.",1
"I definitely want to write about this place on the basis of multiple reviews. However, I also like to chronicle my experiences on the same day so that I don't lose the little details. n nHad about half an hour for lunch and decided to try to sneak in my first visit to Thai Food To Go. Yelp showed a dine in offer for free thai tea, so I defied half of the restaurant's name. Luckily, I went with a Thai option off the lunch specials menu instead of picking one of the options that would have spit in the face of the other half of the name. n nMy heresy earned me not only the thai tea, but also the delicious soup of the day that was quickly brought out. It was sour in a very good way, reminiscent of a Vietnamese soup that I enjoy. Cabbage, mushroom, tomatoes were all part of this pleasant surprise. n nJust as I was finishing my soup, the main event arrived. The chicken potsticker my preference over my mortal enemy the veggie egg roll was delicious, and the sauce on it was, strangely enough, not mayonnaise y. My choice of fried rice was very fortunate because it was basically eggs mixed into white rice, so you get the eggy bonus without adding unusual flavors. My beef red curry was very good and had tons of properly cooked, crunchy green beans in addition to the red and green peppers. Unfortunately, it seems that I got the ""Asian person "" mild spice level, testing my rather sensitive tongue. This didn't detract from my experience, especially with some Thai tea available to help quench the fire, but it probably slowed me down a couple minutes. n nBy the way, the Thai tea was definitely as solid as any other place, and the final bill of 6.45 makes the experience pretty much a steal. And it only took 35 minutes out of my day, including driving time. Guess I'm gonna come back a lot!",2
"Ever wanted to dress as Scooby Doo, a pirate, Austin Powers, or maybe even Edward Scissor hands? Party Mania offers nearly every costume and fancy dress accessory you could imagine and much more. One glaring problem, however, was the jaw dropping price of such costumes. I repeatedly winced at the u00a350 price tags and considering the shop doesn't offer a rental service on the racked items you'd probably have to work at Disney Land to see the advantage of buying such pricey attire. I suppose these are unique costumes and this fact partially justifies the price, but u00a350, have mercy! No wonder the majority moan at proposal of a fancy dress party.",1
"I have been going to Dr. Rios for several years and I think he is great. My eyes are a weird shape and I always had difficulty finding contact lenses, but he was able to determine the perfect brand. I agree with several of the other posters regarding the facility being a bit dated and the office staff not always being the most professional and pleasant however, I care more about my physician being competent and professional than his staff.",2
"Great for happy hour, an reverse happy hour. Sushi is top notch, they have a bunch of custom rolls that are great. Great atmosphere, real urban downtown feel.",2
" 1 because it's a CHAIN. How disappointing. But, I have got to give this place corporation high marks for the name. Genuwine and ballsy. And the ""accessories "" they sell advertising their very own Pink Taco are ingenious too. n nSo, we just had to have the pink tacos, 3 chix tacos, ""TJ style "" and they were pretty damn tasty. The fact that the bartendress gave us our drinks free wasn't too shabby either. Maybe she saw us reading the ""Lesbian Coming Out Manual "" last one off the shelf the Borders down the Street, see the separate review and felt sorry for us? It was a joke, really. She's straight. I am not. Go figure.",2
Great little indian restaurant with a fairly extensive menu. Highly recommended.,2
"The closing time on the door and on the internet said 10 00. So I placed my order online, of course you have to pay with a credit card, and it said I could pick up my pizza at 10 01. I went to the store, just down the road from me and when I got there at 9 59 pm, there was no one there. So I had no pizza AND I was charged for a pizza. When I called the next day, they said they close at 9 00. When I asked them why there hours didn't reflect this both on their door and online, they stated that they hadn't changed it on the door but they couldn't explain why the computer let me place my order. I like Chicago style pizza which is why I went there but, the service and their attitudes are HORRIBLE. They have no idea what customer service is.",1
Was pleasantly surprised. The decor was modern and inviting. The service was fast and friendly. Tad bit pricey but I feel like the quality of the food is worth it. I'll have to try a shake next time.,2
"Small breakfast buffet. I was surprised it was so small. The selections were fresh but not much choice. Just the standard breakfast items, like waffles, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage. Perhaps we were just too early and they hadn't put out more standard fair. n nI did get a fresh made spinach, mushroom and bacon omelet. This was made on the spot and was the best part of the meal. I didn't really see any pastries to speak of, just a small selection of donuts. n nSo as far as a breakfast buffet, this was not impressive enough that I would come back for!",1
"A 4.5 star experience at the Hyatt Place for me. I came to Madison for a wedding, and stayed at the Hyatt instead of where the wedding was cause it was a much better deal. The hotel looks brand new modern. The rooms are spacious with a large sectional couch that could probably sleep two if necessary. Parking is a pretty good deal at 10 day. The location is awesome right by Capitol square. Breakfast in the morning is wonderful! By far the best complimentary hotel breakfast I have ever had worth waking up early for. I will for sue be staying here next time I'm in Madison.",2
"This place is DATED. I had been to the same spa many years ago when Planet Hollywood was the Aladin and it was nice. I don't think they have ever done anything with the spa in 10 years. n nThe maintenance on the spa is terrible. I checked my belongings into a lock box and they gave me a key on a thin rubber band classy . I was in the waiting room was uninviting, with a small tv and the most uncomfortable hard wooden chairs. It was like sitting in a church pew. The chairs were from the Aladin and you needed a massage after sitting in them for 5 minutes. n nThe massage was fine but nothing special, in fact she forgot to do one of my arms but I didn't say anything. n nThere were a whole 3 towels avaialbe to use for the shower. With the look and feel of the place, I wouldn't even think to use the jacuzzi. In the shower, it felt dirty and there were tiles missing in the showers cheap dirty feeling . Again, no maintenance. The ammenities were poor and I couldn't wait to get out of there and back to my room where I could relax. n nI told the manager at the front desk and she offered me free passes to the one they operate in the Paris. Not good enough, besides, I would rather have my money back or discounted. I can't believe they make you do a 20 tip. n nJust thinking about this makes me want to take another shower to feel clean. Go elsewhere, they don't care about their spa and it is a shame that the hotel allows it to operate.",1
"This place often has interesting exhibits. The one they showcased when I went was on the history of a pirate ship and crew, very interesting. Only downside, most of the non travelling exhibits are dull unless you're younger than 13. Worth a look, but costs a few more dollars than I expected.",2
"There are many great studios in town with great energy. I took a class today from the owner Stephanie very negative experience. She is very condescending and confrontational. Even brought a family member with me, the family member didn't want to come back again. Don't go there. She tries to correct peoples postures in a very angry way. I feel bad for Kirk, who is her right hand man and an excellent teacher. If you choose to go to that studio, don't take Stephanie's class. I suggest people go to a convenient location to you.",1
"Oh Mama Mia. If there's a chocolate lover in you, or with you, then you have to put Vosges Haut Chocolat on your list of to do's in LV, cuz it's all good in the chocolate bacon and toffee hood. This place totally rocks! n nI read the reviews, and they were all spot on. You go for their Mo's Bacon Bar, Truffles, and you HAVE to get the Bacon Caramel Toffee for sure! In fact, get two, cuz you're gonna eat it all once you open it up on the way back to your hotel. Yup, that's right. In my case I opened it up in the cab on the way to the airport, and by the time I got home they were aaaaallll GONE! Yeah, I shared, never got so many orgasmic responses on a plane.and they were not snake induced either. n nThe skinny Asian dude here was a really cool cat. He was like a chocolate connoisseur, I asked all the questions about all the offerings and he had a descriptive answer for everything. Yeah, he's like Quality Control there, he's tried it all. He said the hot sellers were the Bacon Caramel Toffees, and the Milk Chocolate Mo's Bacon Bar. I got both. n nWe knew their truffles were good, so we bought the Curry ones hot diggity damn good if you're a curry fan.

"As hard as it is to give Salsarita's a bad review My experience today just topped it. First let me say that this bad review is for this location. I have never had bad experiences at the other locations, but this isn't the first time I've had a bad experience here. First, I arrived at 1 30 PM which I would think would be after the lunch crowd, but the line was almost out the door. At first there were only three people working the line, but eventually it got to five. Also, when I ordered the taco salad the Thursday special they were almost out of romaine lettuce. If this was my first experience at Salsarita's I probably wouldn't come back. I think I'll be done with this location, cannot wait until the Quail Corners location reopens.",1

"I called this company on Wed to make an appointment on Friday at 02 30 pm. 3 00 o'clock rolled around and no one had shown. n nLong story short, I had to call the company a total of 6 times over a 3 hour period before they called another one of their techs. That technician called me and said he would not be able to be at my home by 6pm but he could come over Sat. I did not take no for an answer and demanded that someone show up to my home today. n nThe technician finally showed up just before 6 pm and did a very cursory look at my machine. I told him the machine was not spinning. The only thing he did was open the top console and said the timer was bad the timer set the when the machine fills with water, agitates, spins, etc . It seem to work find when it was set to fill up the tank with water, but the machine would not agitate or spin. n nHe never opened the base to see if a belt was broken or if it was something else. He just got to a point he could blame it on and decided he needed to go. he even left the water in the machine when he filled it up to test the machine. n nThis took approx 10 min for him to charge me 50 bucks and tell me he would call me later with a quote for the parts and labor, but it would be about 300. n nI got a voice mail later that night, and spoke to someone this morning telling me parts and labor would be 270. For 100 more I could have a new machine. I told the office lady that I should have been given a free consultation based on the amount of time I waited and the poor checking of the machine. They said it was their policy to charge the 50 service fee, but it would apply to my 270 for the parts and labor. So did I want to go ahead and approve the parts. n nI told them no as for a hundred more I could have a new machine. So what ever you do please choose another company that hopefully has better customer service and better reliability.",1
"My AC died on the 10 on my way back to LA when it was 110 degrees outside. Desperate I fired up yelp and found this place, they squeezed me in before end of day, we're totally up front about everything and took care of everything. While it sucked to have AC bust crap out in the summer heat of Phoenix, glad it happened near these guys!",2
"Great place to buy all manner of beauty supply products and I found the owner at least I think she was to be very helpful. I was in here several times in 2010, my last visit to Mesa. n nUnfortunately when I drove thru the little center this was in today, the store was empty and signage was down. Whether they moved or closed I will have to find out but it is gone, along with at least two other businesses I know of in this particular center, the wonderful little Z lantro Mexican restaurant I frequented on my last trip, and the Blue Goat restaurant I found on Yelp but didn't find in the center. So sad.",2
"Probably 3.5 stars. I love pizza. And I'm no pizza snob. I can enjoy a good slice of Domino's. Heck, I'll even wolf down a piece of Little Caesar's if times are tight. But if I have my choice, it would be high end gourmet pizza think, Grimadi's, Due Forni . n nOverall, I found Biaggio's to be a little greasy for my taste, but the sauce had a great flavor and it is definitely cheaper than the high end pizza places I like to frequent. We had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and I was a fan of the crust. Not too thick, not too thin. Got a salad too but was nothing to write home about. My man seemed to enjoy the food, so if you aren't worried about grease, Biaggio's is a great choice!",2

"GROSS! I went through the drive thru but had to go in because after waiting 10 mins my food was still not done. Don't go in. It's filthy! Grease everywhere. Thick old grease. They hadn't even started my order. .glad I didn't keep waiting. .and threw it all in a bucket. I ordered extra crispy and got extra greasy. I think I pissed then off because my food was all smashed when I got home. nIf you want fried chicken and you are on the area, go to fry's on Val Vista. Hot, crispy and fresh. n nWhat happened to kfc? Ugh not returning.",1
"we had a group of 17 for dinner here yes, 17 ppl! and they did a set menu for about 100 a person. It was quite good and there were definitely 2 or 3 dishes that were very memorable but the rest were good but not amazing. Great service, very accomodating, and overall really fun and tasty experience.",2
"Not my scene, but for what it's meant to be, it succeeds in excess. The layout was gorgeous, the women were almost as gorgeous as the interior, the DJ was skilled, the patio space was sublime and the dance floor was a constant orgy of rhythmic motion. n nApparently according to all the other reviews , this is the hottest club in Vegas. I only waited in line for 2 minutes, flashed convention press credentials to skip the cover, and didn't have to pay for a single drink the whole time I was there, but that seems to be rare. Mine were comped, but others were complaining about the cost to quality ratio of their drinks.",2
"They don't even deserve one star! Rented the car in San Diego for 2 weeks to return in Vegas. Car nearly broke down on the freeway, going 40 mph with the pedal floored! Returned it in Vegas 6 days early and was lucky enough to borrow a car from family instead to avoid any future hassle from this company.FOX CHARGED ME FOR THE ENTIRE 2 WEEKS! Still in a dispute with the credit card company a month later. Oh yeah, and Fox is trying to use the security deposit return as credit for the early return. Worst rental place, worst customer service! DON'T RENT FROM THEM!",1
Food was good people are nice. Got a little gross out my eggs was green in one part. Food did not have much taste that was kinda disappointing.,1
"Pretty good lunch place, haven't tried it for any other meals. The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was good. There are some unique offerings on the menu. It's a small place, so when the windows are closed it can be a little loud.",2
"The staff was super friendly and the restaurant has a nice ambience, but the sagnaki and gyros were not very good. I prefer a pillowy pita, these were thin and dry. The rice was also dry and the salad was bitter. The sagnaki cheese was overwhelmed by the taste of liquor.",1
Absolutely delicious! Our waiter Robert was great as well. The Andy's sage fried chicken is by far the best thing on the menu it's a big sized portion so make sure you're hungry!,2
I was not very impressed with the customer service I rcvd today. I called to see if they had a certain product and the lady who answered the phone seemed put out by having to take my call. Personally she should have just let the answering machine pick up. I was so caught off guard by her rudeness that I was at a loss for words and then she goes on to tell me that the store is closed until January of next year. I don't think I will be stopping by to see the new store once it opens. ,1
"Two stars only because I didn't get food poisoning yet . n nIf you like cold, bland, stale food and lots of it, this is your place. Dining room was practically empty, but the host sat us in a smaller, crowded side room next to a twelve person child's birthday. We won't be back.",1

The herbs with olive oil and bread are amazing! Can't go wrong with chicken parm!,2
"Yeah! Welcome to the neighborhood! Finally a Trader Joe's on this side of town. Nice new store with wide aisles. n nLove the cured meats, inexpensive cheeses. Yea there are a lot of frozen packaged foods for those that don't like to cook or in a hurry, that is great. Had lots of produce and was not crowded. They were out of a few products but it was later on Saturday.",2
"I watch the 1st season of ABDC and was a fan of the show and definitely a fan of the Jabbawockeez. I wasn't sure what to expect when they had their own show. I'm only used to seeing them performing a few minutes a week which kind of gave us that feeling of wanting to see more. n nSo now we get an hour and a half of them. Since this is Las Vegas, they have to go above and beyond their performances on TV. And for the most part they did. The fight sequences with the Ninjas in the dark was awesome. The throwback songs were a kick but some numbers were a little slow. I was surprised to see more members in the crew but they'll reveal who they really are at the end. n nOverall, it was a great performance. They mixed a few comedy numbers in there and more than enough audience participation acts to keep the whole show interesting.",2
"Okay, its not the hippest place in Vegas. but I'm giving it 4 stars just for the view! If you really want a hip place with long lines and really expensive drinks try the Foundation Room Mandalay Bay , if not, VooDoo lounge is a safe bet.",2
"Four things you're guaranteed at Lazy Joe's Fish Chips A sincere welcome, a smile, a gracious farewell, and some darn good fish. n nI love me some Lazy Joe's! Anytime I'm running errands in the Southwest I try to put Lazy Joe's on my food radar. First off, there IS a Lazy Joe. But he's the least lazy Lazy person I know. He not only takes orders and does some of the cooking, he's floating around from table to table talking to his patrons, and not just talking at them at a shallow level. he genuinely wants to know about them, what their background is, what they do. he's looking for a way to connect with them, and often times he finds it, winding into stories of yesterday and how he came up in the business. He's very interesting and treats every customer like a member of his extended family. n nThe food is a pescaphile's dream! If you don't know what ""pescaphile "" means, you may not be one. The menu includes clams, scallops delish! and many non fish items such as burgers and chicken, which contrary to what Jessica Simpson believes, is not ""of the sea "" and in no way references tuna. However, if you go to Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips and do not get fish, please check in to your nearest insane asylum, cuz you're a bit off and need professional help. n nThe past few times I've went, I've been lucky enough to land on their all you can eat fish fry special, which they run Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The starting round starts with 2 pieces of either cod, haddock, or catfish, six shrimp, and fries. By the time you hit the bottom of your basket, you'll be filled with a sensation of mourning, like, ""This delicious fish. these tasty shrimp. they're all gone! NOOOOOOOO! What have I done to deserve this pain and misery? "" But fear not! Just let Joe and his staff know, and within minutes, the glory of fried fish is back, and this cycle continues until you profusely sweat fish batter. n nExaggeration? Not by much. it's that good. n nIt's a tiny bit on the pricey side, but then again, you're getting fish in the desert, so it comes with the territory. I wish they would expand closer to me, but for now, anytime I find myself on the southwest side of the 215, I look for excuses to be near Lazy Joe's. n nStop in and give it a try. Joe will be glad you did. Legitimately glad.",2
"So this was my first time here and I left disappointed. I had the steak fajitas as well as the chili queso. The food was good but nothing special. The worst part about the experience was our service. We went for lunch and the place was not busy at all. It took almost 40 minutes from the time we order until the food hit our table. We asked one of the mangers for more sauce and he said hold on let me find your server instead of offering to get it for us. On top of that it took almost 10 to 15 minutes to get our drinks. Service killed our experience which is unfortunate. Average food, poor service",1
"This place is always crowded on the weekends it seems. I've never been here when it is not busy. It is fun and it has options. n nWant to chill? Well, hang out on the patio. nWant to dance? Well, there is a dance floor. nWant to drink? Well, this is a bar. nWant to have barely clothed ""batenders "" feed you? Well, they do have that too but the ""liuor in the bottle tastes more like kool aid than liquor. But hey, it's free.",2
Bland. Over cooked noodles. Pricy. Snobby. Pretentious. We decided to eat here because I thought buffet was too expensive for vegan selection only I'm impatient to wait for an hour in the buffet line. What a mistake. The price came out about the same I was stuck with what I ordered. The soy bean was okay but it wasn't labeled organic so it was probably GMO soy. Disappointed.,1
"good addition to this metro city and the cultural life. n nBut how come the entrance is far away from the light rail? I would thought that they would take advantage of this, unless they are car user oriented. n nAside from this, the exposition is well organized and there is much more to learn.",2
Came back on a Saturday afternoon and service was so much better! n nThey must save the really helpful and knowledgeable staff for the peak times. Oh well.,2
"Ever stay at the Luxor? Well, sometimes it's hard to find decent food close by. I recommend Pyramid for breakfast, their portions are huge, the prices are kind of expensive, and it's not that good. Decent, yes, and definitely try the oatmeal. Service sucks, waitresses are grouchy although one of the waiters was very sweet. n nThe food is okay. Just feels like I'm eating at Denny's and paying twice as much. I'd never come here for dinner. They open pretty late though.",1
"Ah Vegas. You're such an amazing playground of extravagance, showmanship, and eye candy. n nRumjungle could be a jewel in your crown when it makes its conversion from restaurant to night club. Two hot dancers dance on pedestals outside to tease the folks waiting in line. Once inside, the illuminated glass shelves behind the bar hold a staggering array of booze. They serve well to guide your attention high above where girls dance in steel cages, and other perform acrobatic feats inside of big hoops. n nIt's a crying shame that Rumjungles weekend DJ had the attention span of a tweaked out eight year old, destroying every attempt I made at shaking my ass. It's a pity that I had to wait ten minutes at the bar only to be informed that you didn't have any oranges so that I could buy an obscenely priced Old Fashioned. n nI simply expect more from my glamorous Vegas night spots. n nBonus Shout Out Major thanks to the wonderful bartender who upgraded our drinks to doubles when we wandered back in for last call.",1
"if there was a fool proof way to keep all the god foresaken yuppies out of this place i might go there every night. since that doesnt seem to be an option i stick to wednesday thursday nights. if you are a drunk like me and the slapasses i associate with then you will enjoy drinking there during the day on saturdays as well. decent bar food, cheap whisk, ping pong, epic patio good enough for me. n np.s. i drive a tahoe and wear polos",2
Horrendous customer service. I went to container park with my kids and as we were leaving we stopped in to get some candy. My son wanted a lollipop as he was reaching for the one he wanted he bumped another one and it fell to the floor. The guy working there ask me for it as I handed it to him I apologized for the accident. After we picked out what we wanted we went to pay. When we were ready to leave the guy said I had to pay for the broken one first before he would sell me anything else. I told him it was an accident he said I still had to pay. I can understand if my son was not being careful but the store is small and not much room. A couple of customers with kids heard what was going on and left,1
"The food was good and I especially loved the hot salsa. HOWEVER, I am vegetarian and ordered from one of the vegetarian items marked with a ""v "". My veggie fajitas came with rice. As I was enjoying my food, I discovered shreds of chicken in my rice. I asked the server if the rice was made with chicken and she said yes it is made with the broth from chicken soup. That is not vegetarian! I would rather them not serve the rice with veggie meals or include a note about this on the menu. I was so disappointed.",1
WARNING !DO NOT TAKE YOUR PET HERE FOR GROOMING! The people here are rude and inconsiderate. The dogs in the place are all howling and unhappy. Very unprofessional staff including the lady in charge. Take your dog somewhere else. This place is the wrong one. Don't risk your loved one. Take them to a better place.,1
The food was great! Waitress was funny. But I still like Paschal's fried chicken better.,2
"I've been wanting to come to Marche' for a long, long time. You won't ever run into this restaurant unless you go into the Desert Shores housing community so it's a hidden gem that some people may not even know is there. I did, because I tried unsuccessfully to buy a house here and got outbid at every corner. n nAngela H. put on a Sunday brunch UYE and we had prime patio seating for it. If it's nice out take advantage of it! It's a shaded patio over looking the lake and has vines and potted plants giving a feel of being in someones lovely yard. It was busy, but not crowded in feeling and was a pleasant vibe for all of us to converse. n nI came late, but they were able to get my food out to me in a jiffy and our server was very pleasant. I had the buckwheat crepes with mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was pleasant and creamy and had to be sopped up with some bread, chicken was cooked right and I like the mushrooms were a mix of beech and oyster. The salad with it was a nice mix of greens with a hint of orange in the vinaigrette. n nI don't know why I haven't gone here sooner, but probably because my ego is bruised that I don't get to walk her from my backyard to brunch at the lake. I most definitely will be back as it's prime outdoor dining weather and the food was solid. I will be back for their weekday lunch special pre fixe as that seems like a great deal!",2
"The place looked promising from the outside, but inside was disappointing. No bar or food service. The room had only two light fixtures, one of which was not working. A call to the front desk got us a speedy response to correct it, but in the end the light bulbs were so dim it was impossible to read or work. No light on the desk? Really? Come on, folks! You can do better than that. Invest a few bucks and buy some lamps! We would never have stayed here had we known, and never will again.",1
"M Butterfly is a recent addition to Princes Street and it just seems to have popped up, the ""To Let "" sign still on the door isn't very reassuring and I have a feeling that it's one of those shops that will only be there until something better moves in. n nThey have handbags, dresses and other accessories on offer and I did see a few handbags that looked quite nice but they were all priced at around u00a330 and certainly weren't worth that. I also noticed a few rather pretty tea dresses but none of the material looked that good quality and I can't imagine many of the items lasting more than a few washes! n nIf the items here were cheaper then I could see the appeal, especially for teens and younger girls as many of the items are very glitzy with diamantes strewn on them but it doesn't seem to want to be aimed at that target audience as the prices are around u00a330 for bags and dresses and I don't know many teens who can afford to pay that.",1
"No impressive.Sorry. The shrimp scampi appetizer that we started with was bland and the shrimp were hard. For dinner, my diver scallops were a cold they were supposed to be warm . Wouldn't come back here again.",1
" ""Q, "" Alex, and Chris arrived ten minutes early for our move. They got right to work and were extremely efficient, friendly, and made us feel like they were helping out their own family. They had to move a house worth of furniture and fragile belonging down a three story stairway of an apartment complex. ""Q, "" Alex, and Chris never batted an eye. They made us feel like it wasn't a big deal at all and that it was a simple move, and they finished moving everything in two hours! It took the other movers a whole day to complete the same task when we moved in, granted it was upstairs, but these guys could have done that move in probably three hours. n nThen they packed everything up in their huge moving truck so that it all fit in perfectly with plenty of room to spare! Next up was moving all the heavy belongings from another house which only took them another hour to do. These guys were so fast, and I couldn't believe how friendly and nice they were the whole time. I'm always apprehensive about movers because I feel like they are annoyed by customers that have them do hard work. But ""Q, "" Alex, and Chris made us feel like it was just another day at the office! n nThey had roll out rugs they set up in the new house to walk on so all dirt would stick to the roll out rugs and not dirty up the house. They wrapped all furniture so well that it could have withstood a nuclear blast! Well maybe I'm exaggerating, but they wrapped furniture with blankets and plastic wrap so well! n nI'd recommend these guys to anyone. And I've had several other moving companies before. Ask for ""Q, "" Alex, and Chris for your movers! You won't be disappointed!",2
"I visited today for the first time in over a year, as i remembered it had a couple of sports shops, which I needed to visit. Oh dear. n nThese have closed down , along with many other shops such as ""Paperbox "", the food court has been largely boarded up and many of the shops that are there were noticeably empty looking. very disappointing and couldn't find what I needed, and sadly i think this place is now in a worse state that other shopping malls in Edinburgh. n nOn the upside, the Sainsbury's is as large as ever, and there is now a Costa, one redeeming feature. n nButs sadly as other reviewers have said, if your not coming food shopping, don't bother.",1
We actually had the brunch buffet here which I was fairly pleased with. There is a plenty to choose from and it is a good deal if you want to avoid the more expensive buffets that are found elsewhere around the Strip. I enjoyed all that I got and my husband loved that fried rice was included on the menu.,2
"I go here all the time when i am at desert ridge. I love watching movies here but it is freezing in the movie. The staff are extremely strict which i understand but i was in an R rated movie with my dad. He went to go get popcorn and a staff member came in asking for my ID and ticket. I told him that my dad was out getting popcorn and i had to wait for him until he came back. Also, I was in a PG 13 movie and they also asked for my ticket. Last time i was here the manager followed me into my movie theater. I get how they have to be strict and not have minors see R movies but i don't understand why i get ""watched "" every time I go here. Definitely lost my business.",1
So I was around the Henderson area and I was starving! So I fired up my yelp and searched up food. It says lee sandwich was around the block and I said why not. So I got there. Place looks good. It's a mini version of the lees sandwich on spring mountain. I ordered no. 1 combination my usual order and large thai tea. I didn't like the drink. The texture was very thick and wasn't even cold enough. All that ice didn't do any good. As for my sandwich I thought yes! My sandwich. I'm hungry! I took a bite into it and it smelled and tasted expired. There was a certain meat in the sandwich that was expired. I gagged. Gross! Sucks I had to experience this. I like the one at spring mountain. I've never had an issue there. I'll just stick to that restaurant. Knock on wood! That I don't ever experience this at the spring mountain location.,1
"I wish I could give zero stars. I live nearby so I was hoping I could use this dry cleaner. I went in yesterday with a few clothing items. Problems 1 They didn't have their prices listed anywhere in the store 2 The woman behind the counter was rude when I asked her how much it would be to dry clean my clothing items. I found it strange that when I asked her the price to dry clean she didn't know and had to punch a bunch of numbers on a calculator to finally tell me that my suit pants would cost 6 , the skirt would be 6 and the jacket would be 7 . I couldn't believe it. No thanks. I will be driving two miles out of my way to go to the cleaners futher north on 7th Ave that charge less than 2 per item. n nI can't believe people patronize this business. Anyone who pays 7 to get a suit jacket dry cleaned must be a millionaire with money to burn or a moron. Don't be a moron.",1
"WORST experience EVER with a restaurant operator! The restaurant industry has been built on passion, love, dedication and perseverance. If you want to ruin a wonderful dinning experience this is your place.",1
"I didn't even make it past the parking lot before the rude started. The catfish sign was out on the sidewalk and the open sign was lit. When I got out of my truck Stacy and a couple other people stated that the restaurant wasn't open today. There's something very strange about the way this place opens and closes. I think they are doing business with products other than BBQ at this place, IYKWIMAITYD.",1
Disgusting. I was afraid to touch any surfaces. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles. The waffles had no texture and the chicken was cold on the outside. It has obviously been cooked the day before and was just quickly refried before serving. Yuck. Stay away.,1
"I came here with a group of friends for a bachelor party. The interior design and overall ambiance are definitely winning features. This place definitely had a ""zen "" feel, especially with the modern style kitchen based right in the middle of the restaurant, for everyone to see. n nI ordered the most expensive menu item, the 8oz free range tenderloin, and it was VERY disappointing, especially in comparison to the wonderful steak that i had the night before at Emeril's Delmonico. n ni prefer my steaks on the medium well side, and this one came out with absolutely no flavor. It was tough and uninspiring. The side dish included two large tater tots, also very disappointing. The tater tots from childhood have a more fulfilling, crunchy taste than these did. the asparagus was unremarkable. n nWe ordered a sample of appetizers, several of which were fine, but nothing special for the price of the meal. That said, several of my other friends did enjoy their appetizers and entrees, including one who raved about his Salmon. Perhaps I shouldn't have ordered red meat at a restaurant specializing in ""Asian Fusion "". n nThe wine list was nice and the service was excellent, and we felt ""cool "" being there, but for the price, I certainly will pass on Sensi on my next trip to the sin city.",1
"Rubios is good,but this location is not the best. They need to get with the program. My food has been cold and when Rubios comes out with new items,they lag in getting that menu item. When rubios.com says a new menu item has arrived it should be on the menu!",1
I have always loved this place and have been coming here since I was in HS! The Hibachi chefs are great and the Sushi is always amazing. The virgin roll and SOS roll are must haves. Also remember to get the fresh watermelon martini while they are in season.,2
"Recently changed from Imperial Palace and now The Quad. Honestly, my friends and I only booked here to save a few bucks but it so was not worth it. n nImmediately upon entering the garage, there was a pungent sewer smell that seemed to linger into the hotel. The elevators were dirty, squeaky, sticky and made it feel like it was unsteady. n nDon't even get me started on our room. Our room had sticky, wet carpet with numerous stains on the ground. The furniture was outdated. We had a broken lampshade and light bulb in the bathroom. Few power outlets did not work. The shower curtain looked moldy and had holes and cuts in it. We had wicker patio furniture and when you leave your room, the door would not properly close all the way. Some sort of mechanism of the door was not working and we found our door opened ajar thinking we had just gotten robbed. So when you leave be sure to check if your door is closed properly! n nWe had called for extra towels and pillows and twice because they kept losing our tickets. Late check out is at 12pm. n nWhen the maintenance man came to our room to fix the lamp, he was rude and didnt even replied back when we talked to him, he straight up just ignored us whenever we asked him a question. n nThe pool I didn't mind, it is a friendly family atmosphere, but not really the Vegas style pool party if this is what you're looking for. They close early at 6pm. n nI'm sure they will be doing renovations and until that time if I see any improvements in the ambiance, decor and service is the hotel I will change my review. But for now, I wish we had just spend the extra few dollars for one night at the Cosmopolitan or any other hotel. You do get what you paid for, but I still feel like we paid too much. We paid 174 for one night amongst 4 people. So in my opinion, still expensive if you're comparing it to a Motel 6. n nIn a positive light, it did serve its purpose as a roof over our head and a place to sleep on the strip. But I would not come back here and would not recommend it to anyone else. If you're looking for a convenient location on the strip that's affordable stay next door at the Harrahs hotel, have been there numerous times and didnt mind it at all.",1

One was helpful but ordered everything wrong and one was pushy. Here are all of the problems we had to deal with n n we ordered a full set of bedding furniture instead of the dresser, we clarified that we want a tv stand . After waiting for 2 weeks, CAN YOU Believe that they delivered a completely wrong bed ? n n Instead of the tv stand, they delivered a dresser which we did not order. So we had to wait for another 2 weeks to get the tv stand. Tv stand finally showed up with a lot of scratches. n n The dresser where the mirror stays on top had one draw does not work. I asked one of their delivery guy to help me fixed it. He told me to call the customer service. Fine! n n we ordered 2 extra armed chairs to go with the set of the dining table which we also bought from Ashley. We had to put them together, took us several hours and one of them had problem. We had to drive 1 hours 30 minutes to exchange and installed it ourselves again. n n except the dining table, every piece of furniture they delivered to us had either scratches or small cracks or faults or low quality. n nI had too many things to do moving into a house and really don't have time to deal with all of their mistakes. Horrible!",1
"Stayed here for 2 nights on Dec 18, 2008. Yea, it was a while ago, but it was such a positive experience, and I'm doing my Vegas reviews right now, so I wanted to share my recollection as I simultaneously browse through pics of that weekend n nI'm gonna do bullet points for this review n Lobby quietly elegant, and there is a grand piano at the lounge area n Bed comfy, but the details elude me n Room soft yellow gold tones, spacious, and with a kitchenette that includes a microwave. Oh, and there's a couch your leech of a buddy can sleep on too. n View decent one of the strip, though you are actually a block away from the center, so it's not the best n Bathroom there's a TV built into the mirror! And the shower was, at the time, the biggest I've ever been in I remember I could imagine myself in it with 4 more girls easily! Unfortunately, in reality, I had myself a nice shower before soaking in a bubble bath. n nI'd definitely stay here again if I was aiming for a nice, quiet getaway in Vegas. It's close enough to all the action on the strip, but don't try walking back to the hotel from TAO it's farther than it looks. Another reason it's so quiet is because there's no casino. If you want to be where all the young, loud, drunkenly crazy, and hopefully half naked girls are, don't stay here.",2
"This was my very first buffet experience in Las Vegas. Somehow, through word of mouth, we knew we had to try this place at least once. nWe've been back a couple of times since. One thing I learned, it's a waste for people who don't eat much in my opinion . n nThe buffet is huge but nothing really stood out. They have all the usual expected buffet fair which is good. There's just so much stuff that I was honestly overwhelmed. Even if you just took one small sample of everything it's too much for me . Top it off at the meat section where you can select a mouthwatering steak and they cook it to your liking right there. A full sized steak, on top of all the other buffet pickings? Whoa. If I could have stuffed all that into my tummy I totally would have.",2
Great mall lots of choices! Great play area and always a pleasure to walk around here,2
"What an awesome event and we sure did pack the place with a great group of people yelp and staff . And tons of food and free booze to that and why wouldn't I give it 5 stars. Parking was a little difficult, but we yelpers are pretty resourceful. Other than that, things went quite smoothly. n nI walked in about 10 minutes late to see the place already packed with fellow yelpers. After getting my name tag I looked around to see if I recognized any familiar faces. I did, but instead of going for my comfort zone, I decided to dine with 3 strangers. Which turned out some great diverse conversations. n nAs per the venue. The hot sauce bar alone will get me back in the door. So many choices, I just started taking shots of them. My stomach is strong for now . The layout is kind of like an upscale fast food joint with some nascar themed paintings, extremely random decor on the walls, and even a nice TV to boot. n nBooze wise, they offered pretty much whatever we wanted. Being that I may be one of the most interesting men in the world, I had to go Dos Equis. No regrets, great beer. They had other above average beers on tap such as an Octoberfest. I also saw plenty of people drinking wine as well. n nThe first bit of food that came out was the chips and accoutrements. The guac was solid, probably one of my favorite things of the eve. The cheese was of the nacho consistency and the salsa was pretty straight up salsa. Of course I added some smack my ass and call me Sally sauce to it. Next came a flauta stuffed with cream cheese and jalapenos. A great play on a popper. Then came another flauta, this one with chicken and cheese. It didn't really do it for me honestly. Then a blackened chicken taco with beans and rice was put in front of me. Not bad at all, and it would be rude to leave anything on the plate, right? So, I just kept on eating. Next up to bat, a big ole burrito. Good thing we split it, I was past full by this point. Oh yeah, dessert, LOL! Another flauta! Cookie dough. Pretty damn tasty. And the churros as well. Not too shabby. Towards the end of the meal I got up and took a look at the menu. This place is CHEAP! Great amount of food per theoretical dollar. n nAs the staff had done all night, they took one more chance to talk with us. A 10 gift certificate was in our future. Man these guys know how to spoil some yelpers. Thanks a lot to the whole crew for such hard work. I hope others tipped as much as I did.",2
Not a fan. The food was dry and bland. n nNot sure how someone could make a bland burger. Just add salt and pepper. n nToo pricey for such limited return as well. n nToo many other great places in the area to come back here.,1
"tl dr terrible bagels, terrible service, go elsewhere. n nIf I could give this zero stars I would because it is a sad excuse for a restaurant. They were out of cream cheese at 8AM, but they had butter and jelly which you had to put on your own bagel. That would have been fine had they not charged me for the cream cheese anyway even though I questioned it . The cashier was super curt with us despite there being nobody else in the line. n nThey ""toasted "" my bagel in a panini press, which squished it down flat and made it taste like sliced bread. I also ordered coffee, which was below average. The worst part was probably that the lid to the cup was super flimsy clear plastic that bent every time the cup changed shape, so that when I went to pick up the cup, coffee spilled all over my hands and I couldn't put the lid on tighter or readjust it . n nAll around a thumbs down. Would not recommend.",1
"Yes it's BYOB, but if you go with a group your sushi COMES ON A BOAT WITH FIRE! annnnd the caterpillar role is shaped like a catipillar with carrot eyes and celery slivers for antenna. Too cool for school!",2
"The name is deceiving, not anything at all like NY style pizza, not even close! Was hoping to get pizza like back home and was disappointed to say the least. The wings were good. The pizza was very doughy, not thin, dough was definitely not handmade. It tasted pre made. It was very salty, not enough cheese, too much spice in sauce, and even more dry seasonings sprinkled on top, which is totally not necessary. If you're not used to East Coast style pizza then this place would probably be acceptable. Won't eat there again.",1
"J'aime bien mon Juliette et chocolat.

"Warning this is a bit of a novel. To get to the parts about the food and service, skip to the end. If you want to hear the story, read on. n nThis place is beyond ridiculous. My friend and I walk in after a race, are greeted by the owner, and a nice mother and daughter immediately start recommending items for us. n nMy friend orders the chorizo breakfast and I the falafel pita naturally . I am always very skeptical about ordering falafel because so many places just don't get it right. It's either been frozen, it's too greasy, or too dry. So, as you can tell, I was nervous. n nThe owner is super friendly when taking our order and just made us feel as though we were at home. We talk to the other patrons in the restaurant for a while it really says something that extremely friendly, intelligent people eat here , and then go take our seats outside. The woman cooking the good brings us out two of the most amazing plates of food I've seen in a while, and the owner follows her with the forks, airing us that the food is freshly made and that he hopes we enjoy it. n nWe dig in, and oh my goodness. The chorizo had the perfect amount of spice according to my friend , and the falafel. oh, the falafel. It was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Just perfect! I have never enjoyed falafel that thoroughly every bite was just a little piece of heaven. n nAfter finishing our meal, I had to step back inside to compliment the owner on the falafel, to which he responded by showing us just how truly fresh it is. They make a huge batch of it from scratch every day! I was so impressed by the quality and by how he made me feel right at home. n nI thought things couldn't get better, but as we were walking out, he wanted to make sure we had enough water since we had just run a race. Talk about a wonderful human being! n nI'll definitely be coming back here!",2
"Ask for Jackie. You know the difference between an orgasm and a massage by Jackie? No one has to sleep in the wet spot. nKnow what a massage by Jackie and an orgasm have in common? EVERYTHING! I swear, I have had lots of massages. They all start by gently feeling your back for 10 min. NOT Jackie! She asked how firm I liked it and said pretty firm. She told me shes stronger than she looks. HOLY UNDERSTATEMENT, Batman! She laid right into me, and when I thought it was going to be too hard it felt better so fast I learned to trust her. n I have been engaged to people who didnt know my body as well as she did. To prevent the questions Yes, I do mean you, and Yes you ARE the reason I'm gay now. Go follow someone elses Yelp if your feelings are hurt n She started on my back, worked her way through my whole body and ended with my back, and feet. n It was a SERIOUS massage. It was peaceful, relaxing, and GOOD! I was really glad I forego the 15 minute for scrub, when she offered to just let me have the time in massage instead. I will be going back, I strongly recommend you go too. Now, before I book her for the next year straight! nI wish there were more stars to give her. I cant really rate the facility too much, as I was in a blissful stupor when I left, and got there a little late, so I was rushing in. I can tell you the bathroom was clean, and I think I broke the faucet. The room was very calming, peaceful, smelled good, and was spotlessly clean.",2
Can't say enough about how much fun this show was. We had picked up tickets through Travel zoo and had an awesome awesome time. The musicians really seem to enjoy what they're doing and they're attitude is infectious .,2
"Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady medical assistant maybe . No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said, ""no one called you with the results yet? NO! Will not see this doctor again. Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable, not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment.",1
"Waste our money. First the house style chips came to the table burn. That should have been I clue to leave but we decided to stick it out and hope thing would improve boy where we wrong. The food was BAD all around. My wife is from New Orleans so we know how the food should taste. This place doesn't rate a one star. About the only item I would give just an OK to, is the shrimp and grits. Dine at your risk. You been warned.",1
Smh city out here. They literally cheapened the whole menu at carnegie. this is not the pastrami sandwich I remember. Its dry now.,1
"The patio area is just beautiful anytime of the day! I would recommend sitting outside if possible. n nThe menu is fantastic! My favorite items are the french fries and the mac and cheese. I know those are pretty juvenile dishes, but they are to die for!",2
"Overpriced drinks and food. Rude to mean staff depending on your definition of customer service. Ordered hot chocolate and latte was nine bucks for alright drinks. Cinnamon buns are 8 bucks here. They are into the fair trade sentiment that is great maybe make your prices fair to the customer. On a positive note, I liked their decor",1
"I give five stars to the salesman who helped me since he was awesome. I give 5 to their logistics. I ordered over 5000 worth of furniture and was donating my old items to a family in need. I scheduled for delivery and I get a call from Phoenix that there was a delay. I let that first one slide. The next week, they call AGAIN to say there was a delay so I cancelled my order and gave my money to someone else. We are in a tough economy so I get it, but when someone wants to buy scramble like hell to get it delivered. This was not the fault of the store or the sales team. The delivery side who doesn't get sales and how tough it is doesn't get that their inability to deliver causes people to not shop there again. I hope they understand they lost a customer! I used to buy from there, but now I don't see the point.",1
"What it lacks in hipness and personality, it makes up for with kick ass coffee. Never been disappointed here.",2
"What a hidden gem in the South Hills. This fun Little store carters to a wide range a spiritual curiosities. You can explore your psychic side with a modest selection of power crystals, tarot cards and scents. I found the selection of books to be helpful and spanned a wide range of interest.",2
This location is out of business.,1
"i found our server to be completely fake, and somewhat condescending. she just seemed to tolerate our party of 2. she was less than attentive, providing no plates or silverware for our appetizers i remedied the situation by getting them myself. the margarita was very good and a fair value during happy hour, which was not crowded at all.",1
Too packed with college kids and too much of a sweat box. I would rather spend my time somewhere else and save up to hit the clubs in Vegas. This was a disappointment and I was expecting more from Scottsdale. Only good thing was a bartender who kept giving me free drinks!,1
Fun show. Saw it twice.,2
Should be ashamed to call themselves a veterinary practice. I'd rather let my animal die than go back.,1
"Huge selection of flavors to chose from. I had the key lime pie, and strawberry cheesecake. Both were Dalish! The key lime was extremely tart, but creamy and with chunks of gram cracker crust, it was perfect! There are a couple tables and chairs both inside and out to sit and chat while enjoying your gelato!",2
Tried this place for the first time after living in South Carolina for 6 years because they advertise gluten free. The cashiers were very friendly and helpful about ordering my food but the cook seemed irritated when they asked him a question and they Only had one fryer working so could not get wings that would be gluten free. I ordered the sampler and the food was so so. Unfortunately I has a severe reaction after eating here. The kitchen obviously did not take precautions. They advertise gluten free but really should not.,1
"I had a pretty great experience here. I was at a conference during the week, starting on Sunday mid day. The rooms weren't ready from the packed weekend, so we ate at the Wicked Spoon upstairs while we waited for them to text us that our room keys were active. I'll give a separate review of how frigging amazing the brunch was. n nYou can see the pic below of the view from my room. I don't know if it was the conference rate sxsw v2v , or if the week day price is always good, but I had a big, nice suite for 180 a night, and the private balcony faced the Bellagio fountains and the strip. My bathroom had a large spa tub and vast walk in shower. n nEverything was very luxurious, but there was food left in the microwave from the previous tenant. I called about it, and it was promptly removed by a very friendly member of their staff. They were great about the whole thing, and though I had picked up things from the mini bar not knowing that I would get charged immediately , they removed the charges. Don't touch anything unless you want to pay for it! n nThe accommodations and service were excellent. We dined at most of the restaurants and caf u00e9s in the hotel, I saw much of the conference space, and we had some drinks at the bars. It has a great central location, but the casino is definitely lacking. Just kind of blah. n nRegardless of the minor shortcomings, I will definitely be staying here again.",2
"I was excited when this restaurant opened so close to me. As a vegetarian there are limited restaurants that I can enjoy. I decided to meet some clients there to discuss their upcoming wedding photography. Their menu had a lot of choices and I was impressed with the different things I could try. I decided for meeting my clients, I would just have a piece of cake and something to drink. I got my drink and my clients got their items after about 20 min. but my item did not arrive. I had asked three different people if they could check on where it was, each time they indicated that they could, but no one thought to walk to the bakery case and put the piece of cake on the plate and bring it to me. 45 minutes later I finally just asked for the item to go. I didn't get an apology, or offer to rectify the situation. The Individual that finally brought me my food, in the to go box, was aware I had been waiting almost an hour. I'm sure this restaurant is wonderful for a lot of people, I have no intention on returning.",1
"Food is good, all different kind of small dishes to try but it adds up on the bill. Had to order a lot of things to get full. Service was pretty fast. It would be nice if they have more pictures of the food. Not everyone can read Japanese on the wall. ",2
"I normally like BWW for beer and wings but this one is pretty terrible. The service is poor, upon arriving there was a wait, so the girl asked if we wanted inside or outside I asked what the waits were for each and she said 10 for inside and about 20 for outside. I put us down for inside so it would come up quicker, then several people came up behind us and were seated before us, on the patio. Weird. So we are seated and we order beers and appetizers garlic mushrooms and the mushrooms came before the beer. And they were tiny. I tasted no mushrooms in the breading, and I've had them before and they haven't been like that. By the time I got my beer I was so thirsty I drank it all before my wings came. Then my mango habenero wings came, and no beer. So while waiting for my next beer my songs got cold. Bad experience, bad meal, if we do ever go back to a BWW it won't be this one.",1
"I'm so glad I can finally write a review on this show because it is effing stupid! Saw it a few years back because of the highly rated reviews, but was completely disappointed, angered, and frustrated about how anyone can possibly consider this to be entertaining. It was the worst waste of an hour and a half of my life, needless to say total waste of 200 dollars for two tickets. I left wondering if there was something that I didn't understand, inside jokes that I've missed, or that I wasn't stoned or drunk to find the show of a shred of entertainment value. n nLet me break it down to you the show consists of tp running down the audience, watching the bluemen eating and subsequently vomitting spaghetti and twinkie, making crunching noises from eating cereal, and stupidly staring at each other. If anyone can help me justify how this show exists, or likewise provide insight on what I've missed, I welcome your feedback, otherwise, do me a favor and save your money. However, if you must insist on finding out for yourself, make sure you're get wsted enough something I wish I had done before watching the show so that you can wash off that hour and a half of your life along with your hangover the next morning.",1
"Meh. I went here for an appointment with Anastasia for gel and glitter. I waited patiently and ended up with an appointment with a completely different person than what I was told I was going to see. n n I asked her I wanted gel with glitter and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said she can do gel polish with glitter in it but not any type of loose glitter with gel. The lady they gave me only does regular acrylic nails and was even too afraid to do the glitter as she didn't know what she was doing. Finally another lady said that she can do it but that i would need to wait a moment until she's finished with the appointment. n n I waited a half an hour and finally saw the lady. I did not realize that she was pushing me in between her appointment and she did it very quickly, maybe lasted about 20 minutes. I have never had my nails done that only takes 20 minutes. She ended up using a shellac gel instead of an actual gel builder. And it was very clumpy and uneven, to were you could see a dip in the middle of each of my nails. n n The only reason I'm giving it any stars is that the owner was very apologetic and tried to accommodate the situation, but I was disappointed. n n Also, I had went there with a spa finder gift card. I had 10 left. instead of just taking the money off of that card and giving me the card to go somewhere else, the receptionist traded it for a total bliss card. This now, forces me to have to go back to them just use the rest of the card.",1
"Went to the Electronics Dept. the other night to buy a lense for my Nikon. They weren't very busy but no one was coming to help us so we went to the cashier and she said as soon as she was done with the 2 people in her line that she would come and help us. We waited for another 10 minutes and turned around and the cashier ""Kim "" was no where to be found. We asked the guy that was behind the counter and he said she left for the night. This young man tried to help us but he couldn't find the lense but at least he tried. So I came home and went on the Walmart site and ordered my lense and saved myself 20.00. This Walmarts customer care sucks!",1
"Goodness gracious ! n nGetting in was not a problem, in fact we were lucky to be comped 2 bottles and placed right next to deadmau5 dj arena!

She blamed me for being the girl she told apparently 3 x not to sit at a certain area of the table! n nI was than kicked out of the table and i pulled the rest of the girls with me!

"I ordered their Chicken Waldorf sandwich on wheat bread and a half salad. The chicken waldorf was excellent big chunks of chicken with cranberries and nuts yum! The wheat bread was huge think texas toast size which made it very difficult to eat two slices as a sandwich. I eventually threw the bread aside and just ate the chicken salad out of it with a fork. n nThe half salad was bad. No, really bad. The lettuce was not fresh and I had a lot of pieces of lettuce that had the hard white vein running through the middle of the leaf. Ick. They don't have french dressing so I went with the honey mustard which was another bad choice. I took two bites and threw it away there went 3! n nFor the amount of money I spent total was almost 10! and for the amount of food and the quality I received the next time I'm going elsewhere.",1
An uptown pizzeria with delicious food and great atmosphere. The Parlor is more urban feeling than their downtown cousins though achieves a more family style friendly atmosphere.

"This just solidifies me not wanting to go to the Cosmo to gamble anymore. Been planning a trip out to Cosmo since last month because of the fun stay I had over labor day weekend. Made my reservation when I saw the B1G1 free night offered, but booked it for the second Monday in November instead of the second Monday in December! So aggravating and even though I played at a decent level during my last stay on the slots, plus we spent over 2k on rooms and food clubs etc over just a couple days, and no help at all. A host quoted me the online rate thinking I was stupid and hadn't done my research.

I ordered the lobster for main course when the food came out, first bite was too salty and nasty. I gave to my friends to taste it. they all agree that I need to let the server know about it. n nthe server, she was very kind to re made it for me i think it should be that's way because of I paid for 50 for that. no matter what the food was re made but still not good as you paid for 50. n nGood experience but not worth for money, if you are going to spend 2000 per table.",1

"I've only had one burger here so far, but it was so salty that I doubt I could bring myself to go there again. n nThe ""smash "" portion of the burger appears to be a seasoning mix that is seared into one side of the patty.

"I don't think this place is even open anymore because it's not showing up on the Fairfield Inn website, but it doesn't surprise me because it was gross. n nWe stayed here two years ago for my sister's wedding in Scottsdale. Scottsdale is a pretty expensive area and since we were going to be in AZ for a while we didn't want to blow all our right away. The Fairfield Inn got decent reviews everywhere, was close to where we needed to be, and was inexpensive. I thought because it was a Marriott chain it would at least be ok. I wasn't expecting to be wowed, I just wanted a clean, safe place to stay for a couple nights. n nIt was gross. The place was falling apart. There was chipped paint everywhere, the pool lining had a rip in it, the cement ""deck "" was crumbling. The pictures from the website obviously were from 5 or 10 years before! Our room looked pretty clean, but it just didn't smell right and the whole time we were there I just felt gross and didn't want any of my stuff to hit the ground, lest we take home some of the funk with us. The stairwells were dimly lit and so were the outdoor walkways between rooms. It was creepy and super Motel like. n n I've never been a fan of chain hotels restaurants or anything else for that matter and this confirmed some of my issues with them. They've got the name and familiarity to keep customers coming in, so they don't really have to focus on quality or service. n nI was soooo happy to check out of there and since I'll be heading for another visit to Scottsdale pretty soon have a new nephew to meet! , I'll be happy to spend a lot more money if I have to, to stay somewhere that doesn't make my skin crawl!",1
Love this airport! Quick and easy!,2
"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!",1
Not enemy 1 star. Had coconut shrimp where's the coconut and can you cook the coating so it is crispy? Shrimp was tasteless. Fish and chips were bad too absolutely zero flavor.,1
"I've waited a few years but have to say that Margie Dacko has no business as a midwife and I would recommend staying as far away from this individual as possible. I nearly lost my daughter and my wife because of this person's gross negligence. Thankfully, the doctor was able to save my daughter, who had to be recesitated upon an emergency c section. My wife spent 33 hours in labor and Margie barely got left our couch and was more concerned with the tv and getting out of our house than the well being of my family. We found her to be incredibly lazy and the Margie Dacko who came to our house was not the same nice lady we met with beforehand when she wanted to our business. I could go on, but this is a difficult matter and I just want to get the word out that Margie Dacko should be avoided at all costs.",1
"Second time here, ordered a Greek Salad with Chicken Kabob. the plate was so small i couldn't cut my chicken or even fork out the cheap iceberg lettuce without some falling on the table, chicken was way too saucy as well. Stick to a gyro, had that last time and it was golden. Seems like good people, they are nice.",1
"I've been here twice so far. The first time, I was impressed. The second time, I was indifferent. It is mostly fish and chips, and they are a fixture in the plaza while other places come and go, Baker's Cove has been there for years and has many loyal customers who go there faithfully, as established regulars. This made me want to give it another chance. n nThis time, my companion and I both started with the clam chowder, which is made in house. It is runnier than many but really tasty nice use of spices. I had the haddock and chips. Both were golden, crispy and good, and the tartar sauce was home made! Yum! My companion had a daily special haddock with creole sauce delicious and spicy with lemony mashed potatoes. n nIn all, a delicious meal, with plentiful portions. The only sad thing was that we didn't have room for dessert!",2
" This review is for the bar area only n nI was in Milos for about 45 minutes to meet with my cousin and pre game for a bit before heading down stairs to see Mariachi El Bronx explode on the main floor of Cosmo. n nThe bar area is super cozy and the bartenders are very attentive. This area not only overlooks the restaurant, but you also get a sweet view of the bustling Cosmo floor, great spot for people watching. The drinks here are pricey, but are also pretty stiff, so it balances out. I didn't eat during this quick trip, but I will be back because the food smells coming out this place were intoxicating. n nPRO TIP nAvoid the long wait and eat at the bar. You can order food and chow down in the bar area if the restaurant is slammed.",2
Just left there after trying this place for the 1st time. Our server Tim recommended his favorite dish the Baked Rigatoni. Wen waited 29 minutes timed it just to get a very dry no sauce overcooked dish. We tried it and left the rest. Tim was not people friendly. We had to get his attention a few times to come attend to us. We will not be returning.,1
"This was my second trip to Station Street. The first visit, about a year earlier, I had a wonderful falafel sandwich. My husband had a requisite dog which was quite good. After passing by many times, we recently went for a second go round. It was early and empty. After loving the falafel, I ordered it again. My husband ordered a hot dog with chili and cheese. We sat at the bar by the cooking area. Big mistake. From there, the lack of cleanliness was obvious and did not bode well for the rest of the meal. The staff was deep frying my falafel while dancing and using the serving bowl near her mouth to whisper to a co worker. Yikes, I should have left right there. But I stayed for the queasy, unsatisfactory meal. Stale wrap, overcooked and mushy falafel, the chile on the dog looked more like salsa pale and flavorless . We were able to eat a portion and then put the rest in the trash. A waste of 16.00. That will teach us not to go the extra couple miles to D's Six Packs Dogs.",1
Sat and waited for an hour to be seen by a PA that then left to get my prescriptions and didn't come back for 20 minutes. Very poor service and did not get treated for the pain I was having. Would never go back to the Urgent Care again.,1
"Totally worth checking out, the ticket is 25 bucks but you can talk yourself into a 10 off coupon if you work the people at the counter. n nSome of the figures are better than others, but it's all very well done and entertaining. They encourage you to touch and pose with the figures. It's a lot of fun if you are with a couple people and have a camera!",2
"There is no need for any of the gourmet burger joints in town so long as In N Out is around. For two bucks and change, an animal style burger from here beats anything Kerry Simon, Hubert Keller or anyone else in this town is doing with their meat. n nI do think that INO fries taste like cardboard unless I ask for them cooked light. But that's the beauty of INO, they will undercook your fries if you want. They will overcook your fries if you want. Hell, they'll probably serve them to you in a hair net if you ask nicely. n nGreat staff, 100 order accuracy on every visit in 3 years. I sometimes whine about the lack of decent restaurant options in the Dead Hooker Burial Ground part of SW Vegas, but really I should just shut up and come here.",2
"The management cooks must have changed because this place went from being ok for lunch to horrible! I thought maybe it was a fluke and ate there again but it was worse. nI do not recommend this place! It is very expensive, save your money and head down to Taco Bell.",1
"I came here with a friend who highly recommended it, and I'm a big fan and ready to join the Mosh Pit. It's like a Chipotle assembly line setup where you order your proteins which they grill hot in front of you, and pass you down the line to select your favorite veggies, sauces and other toppings, and they roll it into a nice easy to eat fresh pita choice of white or wheat . This think is easy to eat, and doesn't spill all over your suit.and it fills you up, but in a fresh non gut bomb sort of way that normal monster burritos do. The chicken breast I had was fresh white meat non grizzle and perfect. I shall return to the pit of glory.",2
"So,if you are thinking of eating here but haven't gone to any one of the other acclaimed steakhouses in Las Vegas, I'd highly recommend you go elsewhere. This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us. n nFirst thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title. The steaks are not prime. And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks. They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't. n nSecondly, the service here sucks. No sugar coating here. I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town. Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service. n nWell, hopefully I've dissuaded you. If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on. n nWe ordered the crabcakes. And this is where the problems started. We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell. Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes. Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell. I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells? Unbelievable. n nNext up, the salads. Except we didn't order salads. They were for the table next to us. With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f ing cart, but they served their salad first! I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse. Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause. n nMy steak was ok. 18 oz bone in ribeye. The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy. However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me. Sides were decent. Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected. I didn't much enjoy the bread though. I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty. n nAnd then the final insult. We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again. The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time. At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left. I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone. Why are we ordering dessert still? I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs. After ordering the crepe suzette 17 layers! , we waited a long time for our dessert. A real long time. And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check. At this point our waiter returned! We hadn't seen him since we ordered. Apparently he had been taking care of another table. He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time. He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant. It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks. By this point we were angry. We got here at about 6 45, and it was now 9 15. So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check. I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.",1
"This is a beautiful restaurant with a great patio for afternoon drinks or a sunny lunch date. On my last visit I had the Roasted Beet Bleu Cheese Salad which was to die for. I could eat that every day. I also had the BBQ Brisket Sandwich which was a disappointment. It was good but below average compared to others I've had. Hey, I'm from Kansas City I take my BBQ seriously. Still worthy of five stars.",2
"I've been here before and had a somewhat better experience. This time not so much. As we watch everyone around us get there food, we waited for quite sometime before finally getting our food, only to find the chicken pieces are way to small. We repeatedly asked for drinks and the waiter only visited out table way too few times. I'm sorry I won't be coming back for a very long time.",1
"I still think this place is great, but was disappointed to discover that they will not alter dresses which were not originally purchased from them. n nMaybe they get absolutely tons of business and can afford to be picky, but I would have thought that they would appreciate the extra cash flow. I never want to return to the place where I bought my dress, but would also rather take it to a place which is very familiar with altering wedding dresses. Kudos would have been perfect and very convenient for me. n nIn fact, I was hoping to buy my accessories there they have some gorgeous stuff but it would have been much better if I was able to try the accessory actually with the dress. Wee shame.",2
"We've been looking for a really good Chinese food place in the area, I haven't had luck with the others, the food quality just hasn't been there. We tried Hunan Park last night and were not disappointed. We live 0.9 miles outside of the delivery radius boo! so pick up it is for us, but it's worth it.",2
"The Fredericks of Hollywood in the Fashion Show Mall is great! Huge selection, they had every color and every style. I was shopping for lingerie for my wedding and honeymoon and the salesperson was incredibly helpful, but not pushy or annoying at all. They had everything from soft,lacy lingerie to dirty, raunchy lingerie I bought and few of each . The prices are very reasonable lacy teddie ranges from 22 40 and beautiful corset with bra and garter belt 62. The Fredericks of Hollywood in Meadows mall is tiny and the lingerie seems different cheaper, uglier . I definately recommend this place!",2
Went here for lunch. Took over an hour to place our order and get our food. We had to have the food put in boxes right away. Only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the Saba was really good. The sushi should be avoided.,1
"I am NOT dissapoint! n nGud place to hav food. I come heer vith friend pothed, he say hav munchees. I order panama red subwich, very delishus, yum!

Only bad thing, not much meet on subwich, a little dissapoint. So fore stars not faiv. n nI come agin try something else. Maybe meet voman finally! keep optimistik!",2
Awesome! Excellent service and the food was great. Prices were also very reasonable. Highly recommend !,2
"I don't like this one much because when I asked them a question regarding their Sur La Table brand products, they weren't able to answer and weren't sincere to find an answer for me. Whenever I went there, I always saw the staff idling with each other chit chatting with each other, didn't really bother to ask what I was looking for. They just seemed pretty lazy to me, while the other one in town is more hard working than this store. You can see the review I wrote for the other store. The other one is way way way better. n nOne star for the staff in this store, the second star is a merciful star for Sur La Table itself.",1
" 5 for a slice of white pizza but it was a generous slice. I did get lost trying to look for Secret Pizza, guess if it was easier to find, it wouldn't be such a secret. Third floor, literally through an alley way. Yummy cheesy garlicky pizza. I think half the appeal is looking for it.",2
"Went in to buy a car alarm and was in the section for almost 20min before someone finally came by to assist me. I asked what the differences were between the units and the guy started reading me what was on the box! Really? If all you're going to do is read, be up front and offer to find someone who is knowledgable about the alarms! nI guess everyone that works there are only into laptops and printers!",1
Horrible check in process. So slow and over 100 people backed up on a Monday in May. They should plan staff based on arrivals. Huge waste of time and no apologies or comps for over an hour to check in,1
"Good yogurt, had the taro and coconut flavors very good . Taro tasted like taro and the coconut was the best , put on some coconut sprinkles and mochi and enjoy.",2
"I thought I had the address wrong the first time I went here. This is a huge corporate complex where the heck is the sandwich shop? I decided to give it a shot and parked in the parking garage. As I walked in I was REALLY taken with the amazing landscaping fountains hidden conversation spots all around the outside of the building. I wanted to get a job in the building so I could eat my lunch outside there every day. So I walked into the building and. nothing. No signs of Dagwood's. Then I realized that right in front of me was an area w small tables, a sofa and some nice sitting chairs facing a tv. I had to ask someone when they walked out if that was Dagwood's. It was. So I walked in and went to the side to find that the entrance for Dagwood's is officially at the back of the building but even there I couldn't find a sign. n nA really amazing selection of sandwiches. They had SO many options. And they do breakfast gotta love that. The sandwich was good and all, but my favorite part was walking outside to eat I love Phoenix! My first time here was November and I've eaten outside in December and January too! where I found some round shaded tables where I could eat lunch while looking out at their fake lake with ducks swimming back and forth. Not bad for 5 minutes away from a very industrial part of Tempe. If you work in the area, it's definitely worth a stop.",2
"One word.Meh. This is a place to go if you really don't care how good the food is and you are dying for msg. I would call it cheap Chinese, but the word cheap is not entirely accurate. The food is moderately priced, and what we ordered lacked flavor and was rather plain. The plus side is they are fast and have a big selection of typical American Chinese favorites.",1
"Someone, from Philadelphia mind you, told me the cheesesteak at Uncle Sam's is better than anything he had ever had in Philly. It wasn't. It was incredibly mediocre, dry, and flavorless. n nThe honey wings were pretty good, but aside from that this place sucks. Oh hey look, another generic sports bar type place in a strip mall in Arizona. n nPass.",1
"Help is friendly. Store is messy. Hardly EVER any clothing selection, almost as though this store is forgotten by SA for goods. Not sure mgmnt is problem. Iffy place to go, in my opinion.",1
"This place just keeps getting worse and worse. Get there after 5 pm and expect a half an hour wait to get a table while the restaurant is HALF EMPTY. The food is okay, but the service is absolutely terrible. It will take you another hour and a half to eat because of the delays from the service staff and kitchen. Don't be fooled by the 9.99 three course meal deal signs that show crab legs. The best you can do for 9.99 is spaghetti and meatballs. The small portion of prime rib will cost you about 15. n nThey aren't offering any cheap Vegas specials, like you would expect from a casino so I don't see why they can't seat and serve people in a reasonable amount of time. You are better off going to the chain restaurants across the street for better food and better service for about the same price.",1
"4 stars because they don't take credit cards. Really? In this day and age? Yogurt and shakes were good, but not the best I've ever had, but a solid 4 stars.",2
"I gotta start saying I already wrote a review and it has been erased, so hopefully this one doesn't get erased too, cause then I wouldn't trust yelp reviews anymore, since they only keep the perfect ones. n nFirst their staff is not very capable and speciality knowledgeable. Why i say this cause one of their techs did an ultrasound that according to her words, everything looked very good, 2 weeks later in my third appointment I found out something wasn't quite right when Dr. Jennifer Powers let me know the ultrasound showed an absence that could be a sign of miscarriage, she even asked me if the person who did the ultrasound didn't mentioned it, and I said no she even said everything looked good. Well she set up a second ultrasound for me, ultrasound that it was practiced by the same person and she didn't even know about the special requirements that dr. powers discussed with me. I had to tell her about it. I even suggested her to talk to Dr. Powers about it before the ultrasound but she just said I know what you mean. She knows what I mean?, I don't even know what i mean, i just repeating after dr. powers. Anyways the ultrasound showed I had a miscarriage. n nSecond you don't get to see Dr. Gex until your third or fourth visit in my case I had a loss in my fourth visit and that's when I get to meet him, but just because the ultrasound showed that i had lost my baby, so he just came to let me know I was suffering a miscarriage. It was very uncomfortable that someone I never saw in my life, had to told me such a hard news. But I have to say he was kind and answered all my questions. n nI visited a different doctor last friday to find out what's is wrong since this is my second miscarriage. he did an ultrasound and he found out there's polyps in my uterus, based on that and my symptoms I was diagnostic with possible endometriosis. nso Third how come they couldn't see that in the 2 ultrasounds i got practiced in Dr. Gex office? n nFourth, in the third visit i got practiced a pap test, at least that's what i was told in that visit. Well I need the results to show my other doctor, I called Dr. Gex office for results cause it had been 3 weeks since the test and I never got a call with those, neither they gave it to me in my last visit. So what a surprise when they let me know I didn't get that test, instead I got a gonorrhea test that I was never told about it was negative according to them . So now I'm gonna have to make another appointment to get the test I never got. Btw I also got lots of blood for tests I never got to know about and to be honest i don't even care anymore, since I found someone else who was more knowledgeable that make me feel comfortable and I can trust to , but most importantly that there's a solution for my case and I'll be able to be a mother, and that's all I care. n nSo maybe Dr. Gex works for regular pregnant woman with healthy pregnancies so don't need very capable and knowledgeable people that provide information on time for you to do something in case you need special treatment. But if this is your first pregnancy or even worst a pregnancy after a miscarriage or more, this is not the place to go.",1
"I went here by accident, because I was so hungry I couldn't think straight. But it turned out well! n nI had come out of a long meeting and was just in a low blood sugar muddle. I planned to go to Blue Bear but there were lots of people coming in and out, and I somehow wandered into Circle . I'm really not good when I need food! n nAnyway, there I was, and I immediately felt better. I like the feel of the place, nice and chilled and cool and calm. The waitress was lovely when I couldn't decide what I wanted. And the tea came in a pot and was delicious. n nMy scone was disappointing, though more of a roll, light and bready. I like a scone with a bit of heft to it! Especially when I'm hungry. n nBut yes nice place, free wifi, good tea, patient staff!",2
"We ate there last night. We had the ""gluten friendly "" free Bianca Pizza, it was very good. We loved the atmosphere, the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be returning. Welcome to the neighborhood.",2
"Service overall sucks here, and this was all before we were able to be seated. This place is ran by a bunch of idiots. nWe put our name down with having 2 adults and a child requiring a high chair. The hostess took our name down, incorrectly, and only had us for 2. When we were finally brought to our table, with a normal expected wait, the hostess called out two names and the other group cut in front of us on the way to the table and jumped in our booth. The hostess just froze an idiotic look on their face and then shrugged her shoulders. She then found another table with crap still on it and said that it would be cleaned right away. Now during this entire time, I am holding my child, and when I asked about the high chair, she looked shocked as if she wasn't expecting us to need one. She said she would go find one, and never came back. We literally stood outside of our booth for about 5 minutes waiting on a chair for my son. After I snagged one of the workers, they looked around and finally came back to me saying that all of the high chairs were being currently used. nI sent the wife and kid to the car as I talked to the manager. She seemed truly sincere with her apology but wasn't able to offer any solution. She tried to convince me to come back at another time for a free meal, but didn't take my name down or give any voucher, so I think she was full of crap. nWe went down the road on Durango to Babycakes Cafe, and they were far better than any ihop we have been to. Give them a try before this place!",1
I try and go here at least once or twice a week. Love the flavor and love the taste. Every bowl I have gotten has been off the charts good. I feel full after eating one and feel better as well. Amazing.,2
"I hardly ever get to go out because I have a crazy schedule, so me and some friends decided to go to whiskey rose to try it out at westgate, the bartender was HORRIBLE! I shouldn't have to wait as long as I did for a drink, especially because it was a Sunday night and it was there were 20 people in there tops. Not to mention the drinks were horrible, I felt that she wasn't putting any alcohol in them, I had 3 margaritas and not even a buzz! Thank you for, we ended up leaving and going to toby keiths. my friends and I wont be coming back not worth my money, me and my fianc u00e9 are really understanding people but the dumb blonde behind the bar needs to find a new profession because bartending just isn't working for her. n nIf I could give no stars I would",1
"I don't believe we have ever had poor service or a bad food experience at Red, White , Brew. n nI have to say the bread is always fresh and amazing, so much so that I always seem to enjoy too much of it. n nIf you have never had their steak salad, you need to try it. It's a tender, well marinated steak sitting on a fresh salad. n nAlso, the portions are very generous. I recommend splitting a meal so you can enjoy one of their amazing deserts!",2
"I basically don't like when shops assume I don't know anything about cars because I take my car to a shop to get an oil change rather than doing it myself. I was a loyal Hontech customer until recently I was told I needed a whole new oil pan for my Honda because they could not work with the aftermarket oil plug that was on the car. It had a oil plug used by places like JiffyLube. It has an opening in the center of the oil plug for them to attach a vacuum to suck out the oil. Well the plastic plug in the center had broken off and because of that Hontech could not change the oil and recommended to install a whole new oilpan.I opted out and the next day went to Autozone, bought a new oil plug for 2.50, and changed the oil myself. Saved myself a few hundred dollars. I'm no longer taking my vehicles to Hontech and looking for a new mechanic.",1
"I am reading the reviews and surprised at some of them. I have been going here for about 2 years and really like it. A big plus is that it is in the mall. The food always tastes fresh and I was told they make mostly from scratch, which is a plus for me. I love the guacamole they make it at your table for you. The salsa and chips are so good, the best I have honestly tried in a restaurant. You can get them to go for around 8.00 for a huge bag and probably at least a pint of salsa. I always order the soup and guac. My hubby has had many things on the menu and always is satisfied. This is the only mexican restaurant my son goes to, he loves it.",2
"Yeah, its the baby superstore. Think Bed Bath Beyond, but strictly for babies. Everything is compartmentalized into its own section. Super cute with a huge selection.

"3 drinks eight dishes 2 desserts gave four of us a good feel for the Clever Koi style. This multi Asian concept food needs more definition. n nThe drinks were topped only by the beet salad which was the best of the bunch. The ramen is a good value on the HH menu. Most all meats seemed a bit mushy and ALL of the dishes except the hot pot and octopus had a cloying undertone of sweet. Kung Pao Brisket with no pow, hot pot seafood where the hot was all of the chili variety. Octopus that was tender but served over ""crispy "" rice that just seems like the bottom of the rice pot floating in sauce. Duck bun with interesting, yummy meats but not ""Peking "" and couldn't taste ""charred plum jam. "" n nThe restaurant is in a nice reused building. Parking is behind the building, enter on 1st Ave. for comp valet. Consider sitting outside if the weather warrants it so that your clothes and hair won't reek of cooking smells. Wow, maybe this is the authentic Asian part of the restaurant!? n nIf I lived in the area, this might be a nice little place to toddle over to for a bite. It's not enough to get me to the downtown area for supper out.",1

"Third strike, you're out! I've given this place three opportunities to 1. Provide service with a smile and not an attitude. And 2. Provide a drink that I could actually swallow. Ick. Sop. Bring the mop! I can drink anything, and I actually threw out a pumpkin spice latte from there. It tasted as if it were loaded with white pepper. Sick. I won't return. Starbucks became Starbucks for a reason. It taste good.",1
"Went here a few weeks ago. This place is great! Casual dress with small plates that are very good. Prices are reasonable for what you get as well. We had quite a few plates, however, my favorite was the foie gras stuffed cannelloni with black shaved truffles. It was phenomenal. We shared sangria, which was good. I eyed another customer receiving a dish in a shoe, literally a old loafer type shoe, I asked the waitress about it and she informed me it was a chicken dish that was popular. I would like to go back and try the risotto. Anywhere that is good enough for the owner of El Bulli is good enough for me wink wink ",2
"Okay, my girlfriend and myself decided to try The Italian Pie despite the reviews that I had read. The outside of the building and the location I give 5 stars. As for the environment and food quality . I mean I can only give 2 stars. Honestly as soon as you step into the place you think you are walking into an old Pizza Hut! The place is outdated, poorly decorated, and the layout sucks! The food was just not at all what I expected from an ""Italian "" restaurant. The food we received I could have made myself, only it would have tasted a lot better. Serving size was fine but the taste was bland and probably the cheese ravioli I got had been frozen. Unless the manager plans on redecorating and giving the back of the house a makeover we won't be going back. IF you think it's a place you should just give a try because it's cute, DON'T!",1
"Game has always been last port of call for my violent and antisocial needs. First tends to be any independant gaming shop within easy reach, and second is Gamestation, which despite being the same company as Game, almost always seems to have better deals. n nI was delighted to find on today's visit then, that Game is taking the incentive and lowering their prices a bit, and I got a fantastic bargain of the recently released Yakuza 3 for only 20 bucks. Now I can vent out my sociopathic desires in the safety of my own home, and can cancel my plans of returning to the St James' tomorrow armed to the teeth with hand grenades.",2
"Make sure you ask their pricing and you clearly know what you want first.They added a few extra charges and then tried to explain their fees. They did make me feel guilty of asking why it was more than it was supposed to be.Runs on referral program so unless you tell 10 people about their nail shop expect nothing, after then you get 10.00 off. I guess you give that back neways when you tip, if you tend to tip good.",1
"With practically everyone downloading music, it's hard to find a nice music store like this one. n nThere's something about owning the hard copy of a CD. Holding the CD in your hands that is so much more substantial than an album on your ipod. Their collection is expansive, I would say to have a few CDs in mind and then venture through their goldmine. Granted it won't be as cheap as goodwill but they probably have exactly what you want. n nDefinitely going here for some reasonably priced CDs.",2
"It's a post office. . . Pretty boring really. nAnywho, it's always here when I need it, so that's pretty cool. n nOverall a rather busy place, but they absolutely process quickly so as to help as many customers as possible in the time allotted, no dilly dallying!",2
"Why offer reservations if you can't seat a party within 30 minutes of their reservation time? At least the group that complained ahead of us was offered drinks. All we got was, ""Are you sure?

"This place sucks big time, went for breakfast had to wait 5 mins.to be seated when their was many empty tables. once we were seated we waited 10 mins with not even a cup of coffee severed or I will be right with you said.

"We ate lunch at this restaurant last week. We thought because they are always busy that it would be a safe bet. Boy were we wrong. There were 4 of us and 3 of us ordered the French dip sandwich. You could tell it had been cooked earlier, possibly a day or so because it was tough as shoe leather and so dry. Obviously it had been reheated as it was not edible. Our other guest ordered the pulled pork sandwich and she commented that it tasted old, like it was left over and put in the microwave. When the waiter picked up our plates with most of our food still on them he didn't even ask why we didn't eat the food. I don't know if this was a one time thing but I would definitely not go back. Way too expensive for that low quality of food.",1
Great property! . Excellent Service. Fun pool area. Good food. Retro furniture. You really cannot go wrong here. We stayed mid week so there were no crowds or loud guests. I would choose this over the high end resorts any day.,2
Unfortunately I am having the same issues as many others have had with this company. I purchased the living social deal and what a waste of money. I have been unable to reach anyone from the company and living social is only refunding credit to purchase from their website.,1
"This place is really foul. If Hooters was full of meth heads and had inedible food, it would be this place. n nMost of their waitresses come from the strip joint across the street and while that should be a plus unfortunately they have the attitude that goes with the ""people pay me to shake it "" profession. And keep in mind this isn a grade a strip club. n nThe burgers taste gamey, which i didnt think was possible with beef. The menu is limited, the beer list has 2, maybe 3 beers, and the only saving grace is if you're walking around and really want a coke in a bottle. n nIt was a decent idea when it was heart attack grill and they all dressed like doctors, now it's just an extension of the strip club w a menu to match.",1
If you are expecting a Cirque type show this isn't the one for you. I've been to a few Cirque shows and I felt completely jipped when this one was over. I didn't leave with the feeling of 'WOW!' It was more 'Meh.' nWe bought tickets to Mystere for the following night.,1
"Terrible apartments, do not move in! We rented an apartment here because they seemed the only place willing to accommodate a 3 month lease we're buying a house, so we needed a short lease. From the get go, no one seemed to know what they were doing. We we're told by some chick named Rebecca that all we needed was a 30 day notice before we moved out, same thing from Nicole. Well the manager and some other gal that works there told us it was actually 60 days. They told us it was part of the lease agreement to have renters insurance, well that's fine, but when we got our renters insurance proof they then came back that we needed to have on there that they were an interested party. Nobody told us this until move in day! They didn't have our keys ready move in day, and our apartment was still fresh with paint. I have a toddler, if smelled so bad of paint and some kind of pesticide. The staff just did not seem knowledgable nor did they really seem to care in attending us when all we were trying to do was figure what more we needed to move in! Isn't that what they want?! Find a better place to live!",1
Thai Chili is right behind my house so I've eaten here several times and tried most of the curries and found them all to be very good! Some of the combinations are a little odd yellow curry beef? but I think they're just trying to cater to a broad audience. n nI'm quite certain that they're using a store bought paste but that's not a knock on them as many places do not make their own pastes. Very reasonable prices as well!,2
Last time i was here ordered Rambo burger was served with stale pulled pork and a old hard bun Fries were burnt and my kid would not eat her meal. Next time I went Ordered bacon hot dog and was served frozen in the middle wtf. I have been here 150 times I don't know what is going on but I'm on the fence If I will go back again and when I go in they say wow you have not been here in awhile go figure it out guys. Thanks one of your best customers Aka John Rickles Fu,1
Good atmosphere. Good food. The only negative is the small space. Cesar salad is awesome!,2
"Wow, what an experience. I think this hotel opened prematurely, especially w 4000 rooms. We did not find one person checking out that had a satisfactory experience. Our check in was a nightmare didn't get into our room until after 7pm. They couldn't put us on same floor as our other 2 parties. One friend never got room service. Ours didn't come until 5pm. Hairs in sink. Toilet dirty. Check in clerks less than accommodating. Did have a great check out experience, although I scanned all the agents to see who seemed the most pleasant. They are aware of their shortcomings and are trying to improve, but unfortunately for Aria, most guests will probably not return. Of the 3 guests in line, none were happy and all received some sort of compensation. Not good. Hotel restaurants were good though. Decor is dark. Rather stay at Bellagio, Wynn or Venetian. This hotel needs a lot of work.",1
"Went in for Happy Hour. Food was good. Bartender was rude as could be. Curt, snarky, and a short pour on the wine. Clearly annoyed when we had a question about our bill. Shrimp was tasty, thank goodness.",1
"Shoe lovers beware. nThese guys will act all friendly and act as if they want to help with the sneaker community. But that's not the case. nThe skinny nI met these guys a few years ago at several different shoe shows dxc heated sole I thought we had built a relationship that was friendly. I purchased 2 shoes and I sold a few pairs of shoes through them which they charge 20 no problem they sold my shoes and said they would have someone call me to pick up a check well after a few weeks I noticed my shoes had sold but no call I waited another week before I decided to call, they lied and said they just sold the day before and I was going to get a call soon. I went to pick up check I noticed my other shoes had sold as well but they didn't tell me either I let it go as I got my money but felt like they were not telling people as they didn't have enough money to cover checks ,They have no policy in place for holding a check and they seemed to get upset when I asked about it. I would call in to ask if they can relist my shoes on their Instagram page Brandon seemed to have an issue with and said he would have someone look into it but nothing was done. God forbid you go in there and ask about prices being so high they will give you this attitude about prices being set by customers when in fact they recommend pricing as they want to get as much as they can. There is always 2 3 staff hanging out in there and makes it awkward when ur the only shopper and they are just standing there looking at you. nPlease be careful of the services they offer, they let me know that they can do a legit check on a shoe for me make sure they aren't fakes or variants I thought that was great as there is a lot of fake shoes out here. I finally worked out a deal for a very limited an expensive shoe that I needed to get a legit check so I had the guy meet me there, we go in and it checks out and as I'm closing the deal, Brandon offered him more money that I was able to give. No apology no nothing just a s t eating smile like he won the lottery. He also was boastful online about it as to throw it more in my face. Real questionable business ethics, I won't do business with this store again.",1
"My typical dish of choice is Orange Chicken with Fried Rice. It's AMAZING. I wish I could afford to eat every meal there. n nI no longer live in Laveen, but I will be travelling back to Laveen and who wants to do that just to have lunch dinner at my favorite chinese place in Phoenix. n nYUMMY!",2

"This has become my go to pizza spot in the south side for 3 reasons. I'll expand below. n1. It's fast and easy to order online n2. The price is great for the amount of food you get n3. The food is consistently good n n1. The online ordering is efficient and I've never had to deal with showing up at the store and them not having my order ready. You can order from your desktop or mobile. The order process is easy and you can pay with your card or select paying with cash. n n2. I've tried many other pizza places in the south side area who charge 20 for a large pizza that really isn't that great. Gennaro's allows you to get a large amount of food for under 20. My go to order is a 1 topping medium pizza and 1 order of cheese twists think pepperoni roll type of goodness . The total is just over 19 which is a great deal. The hoagies there are also HUGE if you get the full size. n n3. The food is good. Not great, certainly not horrible but it's good. The crust is usually soft and they have a good cheese to sauce ratio for my liking. I've only had the red sauce selection so I can't speak to the many specialty white pizzas they offer. The twists are delicious and make a great addition to any order. The breadsticks are big and fluffy. The only item that I had and would not get again are the wings. The wings were basically deep fried wings with bbq sauce poured over them, they didn't take the time to toss them and get them nice and saucy. n nOverall if you're looking for solid affordable pizza in the south side Gennaro's is a great option.",2
"I gave this place 2 chances. i love japanese food and really wanted to love this place because it is close to home. I was underwhelmed the first time and disgusted the second time. the food was tasteless and not what the menu stated. Soba noodles are not white, they are buckwheat and are beige at the lightest and brown at the darkest. When I called i had delivery to tell them that I did not get what I ordered, I was told that it was correct and I was wrong. Food was tasteless and service was Awful. Do not waste your money or your time.",1

"I discovered this restaurant a few years ago and have yet to find a better Thai restaurant in the greater Phoenix area. The restaurant is surprisingly slow considering how fantastic the food and service is. It's not often that you find a place with amazing food and no wait for a table!

"Visited Dutch Bros Coffee on March 26th for the first time. What a WOW experience. I mentioned it was my first visit. Each person working in the booth introduced themselves by name through the drive up window, plus an employee in the driveway run up and said hi too. When I received the blended coffee I was asked to try it, I replied it was ""good. "" The young man said if it wasn't great he'd create a new one. I said it was great! Lol. The music was playing, the team was obviously in synch and enjoyed working together. I've never visited a coffee shop with such a strong esprit de corps, plus the coffee was great. I received a punchcard with a couple of extra punches to make sure I returned soon. Today I was searching their website for locations in CA and NV, I look forward to returning to this Tempe site and visiting others as well. Thank you for an uplifting experience!",2
"My visit to Beef 'O'Brady's was my first and only time, so I am going to try them again to hope that they get their act together. The night I stopped in with my wife their was no wait, we were able to get seated promptly, but then the clock started ticking. And ticking and ticking. n nWe were very near walking out when the drink order was finally taken, about 24 minutes after sitting down. The waitress was new, but I do not think that was her fault, I just wish she was given more help support from the management or other co workers who seemed to be numerously staffed that evening. But nobody was lifting a finger to help her with anything. n nAnyways, food was good. I had a wrap, the wife had a salad of some sort.all was good on the food department.but by then the service lag had really just left us wanting to move along. n nHonestly, if management had come around or asked how our meal was, they probably would have gotten an earful, but I figure these things will work themselves out. We will try again later.",1
Elsie helped me pick out the perfect desserts for me and my girlfriend what a nice clean and courteous operation. Great staff and awesome hours. THANKS Swirly Q!,2
"Been here a few times now so it's time for the review. Walked up to the hostess on a Saturday night and she asked if we had reservations, I said ""no "" because I didn't think this place was like that but then spending some time here it kinda makes sense, or Sens. Haha. n nSo one time ended up getting 6 maybe a few more but the beers were going down pretty easy that night different items. Each one well thought out and fun to eat. Yes, I said fun. One was cooked by us on a hot rock, and the others made us investigate each tasty bite. n nYup, the portions are small, but they're darn good vittles I tell ya. Oh yeah, and they have a DJ so they get a few extra hipster points.",2
"I was not a fan of the takeout. The breading is soggy and falls from the meat. The soup was good hot sour , but everything else we had was not good enough for me to go back. Perhaps if you stay there it would be better. But for takeout I do not recommend this place.",1
I LOVED Nancy's nails. They were nice friendly and quick! Nancy is a Great owner. She knew everyone by name and made them fill welcomed! Everyone should go to this place.,2
"Took my girls to Smeeks for the first time today and we had a blast. The selection of candies ranges from your parents' old favorites to your old favorites to stuff you've never seen before.

To do Fusion well, you first have to do authentic well. nFor the price you'd expect something more but no such Fu luck after dining here 2x.the food is just not very special. nIt might be because being in a hotel they are catering to the visitors and consistency do not matter much.too bad for us locals.",1
I've had problems with this location. The machines sometimes do not dispense yogurt when you pull the bar down I've had this happen twice and the guy at the counter had to come fix it! the yogurt is also always really soft and melty compared to some of the other places I've been into. Not sure what the problem is but I'll pass next time. n nTcby has ok yogurt. Not my fave by a longshot but also not at all bad. I much prefer what they sell in the grocery stores to the soft serve though.,1
"Service and Food is R R! n nI make this short and sweet. Lets find the real places in Phoenix and lets support the authentic, creative, and traditional restaurants. n nTrue, it feels a little awkward because of the metaphysical transportation from USA to India. After 10min its like you are in India. Cliche, but lets be honest, if you have have been there its kinda the truth. n nService Very approachable, knowledgeable and sincere. The table next to us for some odd reason didnt like the food, she said it was ""too different. "" Uh? Ok.its Indian food! Its meant to be different. Nonetheless, the ?manager? insisted on offering dessert. The patrons denied his generous offer multiply times. GREAT SERVICE! Our service was 5stars n nFood Sadly, I don't know what I devoured because I arrived late and they just placed the food down as soon as I sat down. That being noted, what ever it was .it was goood! The chicken fell of the bone, the sauces were savory and spicy, and the rice was moist. n nWell R R Recommend Return n nR n nNOte Lock your doors, the Flavors is in a exasperated area.",2
"Went just last week on a Wednesday night, wanted to check out there ""glow party "" very bad! Horrible service.

"If you've read some of my other reviews for car dealerships, you'll probably draw the conclusion that I've been car shopping for the past couple of months. My current insurance company lender USAA offers a ""car buying service "" that is designed to save you money on a new car purchase, and so after several failures at other dealerships I decided to give this option a try. I trust this company, and in turn, I trusted that the dealership they were affiliated with would likely be my best bet, which led me to Chapman Mitsubishi aka Bell Road Mitsubishi in a search for a new Evo. I was supposed to be able to purchase the car for 100 under invoice, a pretty good deal, and so when I pulled up and they had maybe 20 cars on the lot, I got one of those bad gut feelings. I had spoken to the liaison given to me by USAA's website, and expected the process to go smoothly, so I ignored it, and I went in to find him. After requesting him by name, the receptionist called him and I heard him answer in the back of the showroom, and immediately he tried to pawn us off on someone else. That person was unavailable, so he walked over with another guy who he did end up pawning us off on. They had me drive over to their Hyundai dealership so that my trade in could be appraised, which is where the nightmare truly began. It took about 20 minutes for the used car manager to come look at my vehicle to begin with, which was totally unnecessary as this place was completely dead. Then after our short drive to ensure that my car was in perfectly functional condition, I was told to have a seat while this guy who another employee claimed was 'the best in the business' put some numbers together. While I waited, I was then informed that because they didn't have the model I was looking for in stock, that I wouldn't be getting the deal I was quoted online.then my salesman claimed he didn't know where they'd be getting the car from. I already did my research before going there, I knew exactly which dealership's stock they'd be pulling it from, so that was an outright lie. After waiting for over an hour, the salesman read scam artist comes back with an offer for my trade. Now, before I go any further, let me make it very clear that I fully realize I will be getting bent over any time I try to trade in a used car, that's their job, and that's just how the industry works. However, in this case, the guy has the nerve to offer me 8k for a car that books anywhere between 22 33k. I waited for Ashton Kutcher and his camera crew to bust out from the employee lounge or wherever they set up their control room, but much to my surprise, I actually wasn't on an episode of Punk'd. That was really what they tried to offer me for my car. Now, I'd been lowballed on these offers before.I've been offered anywhere from 14.5, to 18, to 23k, but 8,000?!?! This was beyond insulting, and after waiting for over an hour to be insulted like this it was clearly time to walk out. I will never go back to this dealership, and I'd strongly encourage anyone who's considering buying a car from these shady scumbags to go elsewhere if you value customer service and being treated with respect.",1
"Wonderful show. Great dancers and acrobats, great lighting and good music. There were also videos of some parts of Michael's performances which were so compelling to watch that I was sometimes conflicted as to whether to watch the live show or the video! I suppose if you don't like Michael Jackson at all this might not be a good fit for you, but I loved it.",2
"So, we finally got a chance to head back over to Three Amigos after our poor experience the first time. And needless to say, this trip wasn't any better service wise. The only reason I'm not dropping to a 1 star is that the busboy was very helpful and the only person on staff that we saw in the dining room for the majority of our time there . n nHere's how our night went. We were seated immediately in a fairly full restaurant. It quickly became apparent that most of the tables were waiting for checks, so we figured we were starting off on the right foot. The fabulous busboy brought us our chips and salsa and waters. And we waited. And waited. And waited for a full 15 minutes before a server came over to take our order. I got the combo with a chicken taco and a chicken enchilada my boyfriend got the enchiladas verde. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. The busboy again came and filled our waters and brought more chips. Then we waited some more. Until 35 minutes later when our food was delivered. n nAnd after all that waiting the best food I had was the free salsa on the table. No joke. The free salsa with chips was the best thing I ate. We then had to flag the busboy yes again down to bring our check. I didn't even let him set it down before handing him my card to pay. I was done waiting. We then saw our waitress for the last time as she brought our check. I hardly recognized her. But I can tell you exactly what the busboy looks like and that he was working his bum off the whole time. If I'd had any cash I would have handed him the tip directly. n nWe will not be returning to Three Amigos. I'm honestly not pleased that I've now paid 50 for two meals and both were mediocre with some of the worst service I've had. Ever.",1
"NEVER USE THIS SERVICE! n nLast summer, I was going to turn in my Jeep because my lease was up. I had some scratches on my bumper that needed to be buffed out, before the car went back. I searched yelp and found this place, and decided to give it a go. n nI intially called and talked to Claudia in May I think that was her name and said that her and her husband were the owners. I told her what I needed and I would like to set something up to get my bumper buffed out and fixed. She told me that I should hold off on doing the work until the month before I turned it in so that way in case another scratched happened, I would have to pay her twice. my car was going to get turned in around September, FYI n nClaudia also said that she only services Scottsdale, and that I need a driveway to fix my bumper in. I told her that I live in an apartment, and wondered if she had an alternative location that I could drive to, and have her work on my car. She also stated that she will not drive down to Tempe, since she ONLY works in Scottsdale, and that the 101 was to far for her ""service "" to drive. Um, really? red flag 1 n nClaudia also told me that if since I was an apartment dweller and lived in Tempe, I would have to meet her at her storage shed in Fountian Hills and she would do the work there. n nAnyways, a few months went by, and it was finally August. It was time for the car to get fixed. I wanted it done before labor day so that way I could turn the car in sometime in September. I called Claudia since I had already spoken to her before. She remembered me, and told me that she would be unable to help me. I asked her why? She said that the storage unit mgmt had changed in July, and they wont let her work out of it for customers like me any more. really? Red Flag 2 She said unless I had a friend who had a house and a driveway to work out of, then she would not be able to service me. n nPersonally, I think Claudia is a fraud. She was misleading, and I dont trust her response about the storage shed. She claims to be a mobile service company, but picks and chooses where she wants to service. Plus, her storage shed line I thought came across as a bunch of BS. She blew me off the first time in May telling me to wait, then told me in August that things changed on her end with the storage shed. n nDont waste your time with this one. EVER.",1

"Took my Mom and BFF to lunch and we were so disappointed when the server came back to tell us there was NO duck today. What?! Today? Or just at lunch time? We placed our orders with pork, chicken, and beef then proceeded to ask our server if the restaurant was out of duck today or just at lunch. It was really bugging me. The menu shows duck as an option all over the place. She said that we were the only people who ever ordered duck. Ever? Like, as in EVER ever? She said yes. Well, I knew that was a lie. My BFF orders duck from this place on a regular basis, but that's at dinner. So, I asked if she meant that duck wasn't available at lunch only. She smiled and said she wasn't sure. Poor thing. The kitchen did her no favors by being so lazy. n nOn a side note, a bazillion years ago my Mom taught us kiddos to check out the restrooms. If they're clean, you know the kitchens are clean. Eeewwww. I was not pleased with the lady's room. Paper was on the floor and it was smelly. Thank goodness one of the soap dispensers worked. Another eeewww, when I got back to the table there was a fly hovering around. Gross. n nLunch orders consisted of Broccoli Delight with beef bland, overcooked veggies nPa Nang curry with chicken yummy, light on the chicken, overkill on the green peppers and, Mango curry with pork, yummy, light on the pork n nTwo stars because I felt bad for our server and two of three dishes were yummy.

"Two stars. That's it. One for the service. The other is for the pop machine yes pop, not soda! . Everyone was helpful and friendly. The pop machine was a touch screen and had many flavor variations for each choice. My wife and I split an Italian and a Cheesesteak. When subs are hot, they need to be baked, not steamed. Steamed soggy. Overall the steak was just blah. Not much flavor. Better cheesesteaks back home at Sheetz gas station that makes decent food . The Italian had honey ham on it, which is good, just not on an Italian. It gave it a sweet flavor that it should just not have had. Probably won't go back there because the food just wasn't that good. There are some sub places I haven't tried yet, and some I have, that I would go to before I try Firehouse again.",1

Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70 mark up on the price. n nHe then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been 15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid 13 for one pizza when I could have paid 15 for two pizzas?!

"My husband and I decided to try Cibo as it was part of a ""discount card "" fundraiser we had signed up for when I looked at their website menu online, they identified themselves as ""gluten free friendly "" and more than happy to accommodate any allergy dietary needs and as a GF girl, anytime an Italian place says they have GF pasta, I'm pretty happy! We dined on a Saturday evening, with reservations. n nI usually try and keep it pretty positive when it comes to reviewing restaurants but our experience was the complete opposite of positive and I hope some changes can be made their in the future because their food had some great elements their owner was nice but other than that.ugh. n nWhen I mentioned that I am GF and asked if I could get the Chicken Parm but without breadcrumbs which I would normally not even think to ask for but since they had identified themselves as being willing to accomodate allergies I went ahead and asked , I was told the chef ""is busy and wouldn't want to do that but that he could just put some grilled chicken on top of the pasta but she didn't want to ask him to make it ""parmesan "" style, even though I'm pretty sure that would just consist of putting some sauce and cheese on top. I can understand when things are busy it is hard to accomodate special requests even simple ones like mine but as a customer who is paying 20 for dinner , I don't think I should have to worry about if my order will stress the chef out. Either don't claim to be GF friendly or get some more kitchen help? In the end, I ended up paying a pretty high price for noodles, marinara sauce grilled chicken n nOur waitress only smiled when she was dropping off the check we only smiled when we could finally leave.",1
"I heard so many good things about this place.but I was just not impressed. On a friday night, it's a long wait.I'm talking an hour. n nThe food was just ok. It was not special. There were four of us and we shared a little of everything. 3 out of 4 agreed that it was below average. n nMaybe we ordered the wrong thing.but I did not like it.",1
"OK so I went back with my father and this time they really hit it out of the park. Service and food were excellent! Thank you to Jackie for making us feel like we were special and im sorry to say I cant rember my servers name, but he was excellent. We both enjoyed our meal and wanted to thank Flemings for coming through! We will definitely be back!",2
"I'm an Enterprise Plus member.and typically I love renting from them. However this experience was much less than good. n nI rented from the Las Vegas airport location. The counter staff downstairs was exceptional! Thank You. n nIt was when I went upstairs, the treatment was not good. The person placing me into a vehicle was rude and short with my simple questions. And acted miffed that she needed to assist me.crazy.it wasn't even busy. n nShe then put me in a car that has been smoked heavily in, and also had a very sharp, distinct odor of pot. Everyone who rode in the car inquired about it! Not a teetotaler here, but wow Enterprise.embarrassing. n nThe individual checking the car out was unapproachable, but when I called it to the attention of the final check out guard.he just was nonchalant and offered a simple discount, then noted it. n nI guess that's ok? But no offer for a different vehicle.and don't they charge you like 300 if you smoke in the car? Maybe the fine should be given to Enterprise when they pass the car off to you!? n nOverall, it was embarrassing and annoying. And the customer service of the vehicle placement person was unacceptable. n nDon't typically, but gonna begin researching my car rental options. For those that brave Enterprise, don't get pulled over.the smell of pot might get you a nice, convenient vehicle search!",1
Bad ambience. 1h wait for food when there were only 3 other tables with people. Bad quality and quantity of food.,1
"I have never written a review, but I feel compelled to write one for the Marquee. From my experience, the Marquee staff is clearly racist against black people, and therefore regardless of everything else deserve the lowest rating possible. n nI got a table with bottle service for my little brother's 21st birthday. Our group had 7 people. When the staff came to escort us to our table, they let the 5 people that were not black in, and then stopped the two black guys and asked them if they are with us. The guys were clearly with our group. n nThen we show ID's. The girl checking ID's checks everyone's ID, and then when it gets to one of the black guys, checks the ID for a good 15 minutes, while the rest of us wait, on the other side of the ID check. They bring an extra person to check this clearly valid driver's license from Florida, while they harass us for waiting for our friends to get in to be escorted to our table. n nAfter that we got into the club, and by the end of the night, both of the black guys were kicked out of the club, with an 'X' marked in permanent marker on their wrists so they can't get back in. While I did not see what happened, I know everyone in that group. They are long time friends of my little brother's and they are some of the coolest, nicest people I know. They are not the kind of people that cause trouble in clubs. n nIt is inconceivable to me that this was a series of unfortunate mistakes or coincidences. My friends were kicked out for being black and not dressing ""white "" enough. I expect we would have had less problems if they put on a white button up shirt, suite and tie and tried to look extra friendly and smile extra big for the racist Marquee staff. I think the Marquee staff saw two black males and assumed they would cause trouble, so they gave them as much trouble as they could and ultimately kicked them out. n nThis was our experience and we had bottle service. One can only imagine how the staff must treat black males they determine are ""too black "" that just want to come in and have a good time. I'll never go to this club again.",1
"SHAVE ICE! n nFamily dinner night with my brother guys and noticed For Goodness Shake on the way too Famous Dave. Since none of us has been here and know it use too be yogurt shop long time ago. We made sure left some room for dessert too check it out. n nTalk about making a fabulous first impression not only friendly, welcoming, and just feel the passion these local business owners. They actually have Shave Ice! I never noticed on the menu till they pointed it out plus he noticed my local motion tank top. Next thing you know talking stories about Shave Ice back in the 808. He mention Matsumoto. I am not fan of but showed me this guy knows da real kine of shave ice. The machines they were using too make the Shave Ice on point japanese style and cut of ice was spot on. They even put it in same style plastic cup get when ordering Shave Ice back home. It nice size portion too. My only problem is wish they have more flavor syrups still nothing like back home not just your basic strawberry, grape, etc. Also came too toppings more like no toppings so basically pretty straight forward Shave Ice. Still for just being straight forward nice knowing that they shave the ice DA RIGHT WAY! Vegas summer or Extreme Heat Warning Days nothing better then Shave Ice and BONUS not in Henderson but on the right side of town. lol My nieces ordered the Shave Ice. I did try scoop just cause its Shave Ice. n nI ordered one of the shakes. Strawberry shortcake shake. It was pretty good. It had nice strawberry flavor but also taste cake or just this heaviness too the shake with whatever it is they put in it. For sure I found it was a filling shake. They have lot more signature think call them shake plus another side of smoothies. Also in the middle of the menu you can come up with your own shake. My brother ordered one. Not sure what he came up with but he was happy with it! Shake and Shave Ice would say are winnahs! If the smoothie taste anything like the other two you wont be disappointed! n nThey have couple patio tables outside. SInce its the summer weather not exactly ideal place too kick back. Option. I like the interior design like kid family feeling too it. The menu are both electronic so easy too read. If you have questions the staff here is very informative and helpful. They checked up on us once we got Shave Ice and Shake asked how things tasted Each shake they contribute back too Three Squares. Deserves LOVE giving back too the community. Not very big place but since new should be fine. Just hope For Goodness Shake stand the test of time because with this location place has changed few times. Shave Ice count on me coming back for more.",2
"Meh. I've experienced better. n nOkay, I have huge issues with what most Italian cuisine out there poses to be. Don't give me a meal that anyone can make with a decent understanding of how their kitchen and a grocery store work. and then do like a 400 mark up on the price. Worse still, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find a place that use fresh ingredients and makes things from scratch. Otherwise, last I checked, a box of pasta and a can of tomatoes were pretty darn cheap. n nIn another words, I crave authenticity and value I know those two don't always play well with each other , and as usual, this Italian left me disappointed. This place came highly recommended to me as good, fairly priced Italian food. The chicken cannelloni were talked up so much, that three, out of the five of us, ordered it. For 12 a plate, I expect more than just two standard cannelloni even if just a side salad or something , especially if the chicken was pretty dry if I were to guess, a consequence of prefabrication. Yet to its credit, the bechamel sauce had perfect consistency and wasn't too rich. Luckily the bread, oil, and balsamic were gratis so I could at least get my fill. n nLooking at the menu, I will say the prices aren't as bad as most culprits, yet the quality could be taken up a notch to meet them. Also, the ambiance deserves a note. Italian places usually goes in one of two directions a Tuscan kitchen motif or a Sicilian mafia motif. While the former tends to be more intimate, the latter, like this establishment, tends to be classier. The booths have ample leg as well as elbow room. I would call the lighting romantic without being too dim. The hostess was delightfully bubbly. Service by the waitress was spot on without any deficiencies or commendations of note. Despite my trepidations, I might find myself here again.",1
"The Irish Nachos were a bit bland. We came in to get an appetizer, meal and possibly desert. . but once the waitress took our drink and appetizer order, she never took our meal order. I guess if you are not drinking bear or whiskey you can forget about service.",1
"Wow! Visited Phoenix, Az and went into this restaurant with local friends. Unassuming front leads you into a world of delicious mexican food. The guacamole made at the table was excellent, the tortilla chips seemed like they were freshly friend for each table, the extensive margarita list was amazing I suggest the Cadillac . Now for the menu, its amazing, I've gone twice and got the same dish the Tacos Cochinita Pibil, like a moist pulled pork taco stewed in Mayan spices and a homemade tasting queso fresco. I cannot recommend this dish, nor this restaurant enough. Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonable prices, relaxed atmosphere.",2
"Not worth it. Portions are tiny, have to order twice, most of their rolls have 'Cajun' rub, not many choices for the price they offer. nOur server was okay but alittle off. I first ordered gyoza and after getting everything we ordered I told him I never got my gyoza his response was, ""I never heard u say that "" clearly my girl friend I came with heard me and so I said ok can I get an order he walks away. Then we ask to order more, we put an order in for two more rolls, waited 10 mins he comes back and asks if we wanna order dessert so we order that and he brings them over so me and my friend look at each other confused bc we ordered two more rolls and he clearly didn't put that order in so we just paid and left. Totally by wort it and I recommend trying to ignore that server never even got his name! nYama on flamingo and Maryland is the best ayce sushi too bad they don't stay open late or we would of gone there!",1
THIS LOCATION IS NOW CLOSED. Not that anyone was thinking of going there.,1
"I stayed at the Aria last week for 3 nights, four days. The hotel is pretty cosmopolitan, sleek looking. Our flight got in very late at night. We checked in with no problem, but once in our room, there were no electrical outlets bedside and I use a machine to help me breathe at night. When we called the front desk, they said they would come right up with an extension cord. Well, that was 45 minutes later and by now it was 3am and we were very tired. Finally, the service person came in but the extension cord was too short and hung 3 feet in the air next to the bed. He apologized and said he would get a longer cord in the morning. Ok, so if I got up in the middle of the night, I could easily have fallen on the extension cord and hurt myself, but they didn't seem to care about that. Oh, and when I told the front desk, she said I should have ""asked in advance for an extension cord. "" Really? Even a Motel 6 has an electrical outlet next to the bed! Then, the light was out in the shower. We called about that and they did have it fixed by the evening. Honestly, the people working there were pretty cold. Everything in this room is on a computer, so if you are not a techo savvy person, don't stay here. What was REALLY frustrating is after eating out one evening, we had a doggy bag and moved around some cans and snacks to make room in the mini frig. Unfortunately, I when I got home, I had a bill for 94.75 from the mini frig! We didn't eat a thing! Apparently, if you move anything or lift anything at all, it charges the room. nI won't be staying here again. I would rather stay at the Monte Carlo or New York, New York where the hotel is user friendly and people friendly.",1
Went to Food Express on Chinese New Year's Eve and the restaurant was all dark. The sign on the front door said it was under renovations and closed as of Jan 18. n nBummer! n nAnyone know what's happened to Food Express?,1
Awful. Been in line for over half an hour now. Only 8 lanes open out of 26. If it werent for it being a gift it would not be worth the time.,1
"My family and I had a horrible experience here in June. We were visiting from D.C. and our mother took us here because of all the rave reviews. I was 7 months pregnant at the time, and also brought my two young children. The staff was very rude and even asked me to wait outside for our table, the restaurant was NOT crowded and I asked to sit at the bar to wait because I was uncomfortable, but was told I could not. Furthermore, the pizza was not worth any wait! Oregano's pizza is better and the service staff are outstanding compared to snobby Pizzeria Bianco!",1
"The poutine here was excellent! I would recommend the pulled pork chicken. Definitely will be coming back, the service was great as well.",2
"I had read previous reviews from yelpers and took there advice and called 15 minutes prior to my arrival. When I got there, they still hadn't put the pizza in the oven. The lady told me it was going to be another 15 minutes. I'm still here waiting over 25 minutes. nI wish they would have told me that it was going to take an extra hour. The nine orders of people here are getting uptight about this. I'm just seeing people walking in and out of this place. nWhere is the management of this establishment? Although this is a franchise, there should be some type of responsibility for the bad service they provide. The corporate office should investigate what kind of people are running this franchise. nIt gives Little Skeezers a bad name.",1
"Let me set the scene. It a Saturday morning, the second day of spring, there is a blizzard outside, and of all weekends. we choose this one to have a girls only romp in Montreal. nBut we are troopers. and did I mention hungry? n nWe find a restaurant that catches our attention 11 minutes from where we are staying and begin our trek in the snow storm. Wet and cold we arrive and are blown away by the gem we found. Quaint and sophisticated, Universel is not your boring breakfast spot. House music plays in the background, MuchVibe on the TVs and the decor is mix of retro chic, and modern. The breakfast menu is HUGE, service is amazing, and the food came out in less than 10 minutes which is good cause we were starving . n nAll in all amazing breakfast vibe. nI would make this my regular spot if I lived here. nPrices are a little higher than a Cora's but well worth the price. n nIf you find yourself in MTL in a snowstorm and feel your day has been ruined with ever additional flake, this place will warm your belly and your soul.",2
"Let me say, I am not a big buffet fan because I usually get full on plate 2 which is a waste I know. However this luxurious place containing sixteen stations with everything from sushi to hand sliced bacon to cheese and cold cuts, Mexican, seafood, Japanese, Prime Rib plus omelets made to order, chorizo and eggs, pizzas, pastas, fruit and every type of dessert you can think of including gelato between two cookies? Just a decadent display of the most magnificent buffet you could ever visit. This has to be the super bowl of buffets, all for 39 bucks! For 16 bucks more you can have unlimited mimosas. Fast and friendly service but get there early.the line wraps around the casino!",2
"LEZ is FEZ n nHow do you see if a restaurant operates efficiently? Tackle it, for the first time, on a Saturday night.without a reservation. Why initially see a place when they're dead and can handle a rush of 6 customers? n nUnfortunately, for the apparently highly rated Fez, my first impression Fezzled upon entering the incredibly small establishment. There was a wait no doubt, it's Saturday and again, I didn't have a reservation. Thankfully, it was only ""estimated "" at 30 minutes. Honestly, that's not bad. And even when it turned out to be 40 minutes, I wasn't too upset. n nWhat did irk me was the wait at the bar to be acknowledged. The teeny tiny bar comparatively speaking, for the place, it was proportionate was packed, and yet, there was a seat open in front of me with someone's bag on it. Apparently, the person to the left of the bag didn't want any close visitors. I was fine with that, because I had a party of two and we found plush seats off to the side. Back to the wait. n nTEN MINUTES? Sure they're busy, but, incredibly, I tip on service.not because it's expected and when the roughly three bartenders servers behind the bar don't even say ""Greetings, welcome to Fez, I'll be with you in a few moments "" for TEN MINUTES I'm thinking of the savings I will have when if I tip. Yeah, and I've worked with customers clients for many years don't want to date me, so let's just say more than 2 and I was trained, on DAY ONE, that simple gesture immediately acknowledge the new customer. n nNow, so it doesn't sound like I'm a poor patron, when I got service and the drinks, both were great. The friendly bartender was attentive now that he got to me and the drinks strong a PLUS. I learned later that I could've ordered from the waiting seats.however.it wouldn't have really mattered. The roaming servers that were trying to accommodate the waiting and hungry souls, weren't truly helping those who waited. They seemed distracted and annoyed at the lack of direction they were probably given by the multiple voices from the kitchen bar host absent supervisor. In fact, one tried to serve food to me and my friend, even though not only had we not ordered food, but we had yet to see a menu. And while we waited, we witnessed a table of six or so at their table ordering and when the server got half way around the group, he abruptly stopped and left. One patron had to shout out to ask if they could finish ordering. This should've been a red flag for me and my friend. n nFinally.we were sat. Thankfully my partner and I had a lot of catching up to do, because, again we had not seen menus. For ANOTHER TEN MINUTES. Trust me I'm not making this up. And during this time, a couple was sat to my left, I assume they had reservations because they entered the restaurant and was immediately seated. n nNot only did they receive menus while they were sat, but their order was readily taken. A few minutes later, a very nice server named David Adam literally just happened to check on us those were his words. He wanted to know if someone already took our order. Instead of attempting to play the guessing game, I asked for menus. n nI will say David was a saving grace, because he was extremely pleasant and made pitch perfect recommendations to my friend. It was still a long while before he took our order apparently, he was really busy. Again, I was grateful my friend and I had a lot of catching up to do since we had plenty of time on our hands. n nAnother saving grace was the food. We ordered Garlic and Rosemary Fries delicious! for an appetizer, then I ordered the Shrimp Kisra EXCELLENT! and upon David's recommendation my friend ordered Pesto Dijon Lamb Chops. These are her words before ordering and I use them with permission ""I hate lamb, so I'll have the lamb chops. "" n nI laughed, but she trusted David so well, she ordered it. She was not disappointed. Neither was I when I tried it. n nAgain, David made another good recommendation for desert their signature cheesecake. I'm one of the few family members that I know that doesn't favor cheesecake. Yet, this was delicious. n nOkay.To sum it up, if you're unwilling to make a reservation you really, REALLY should but are willing to wait we were in the place for a grand total of 3 hours, so much for going out afterwards she had to get home to her kids they make up for it with the fantastic food. I just think, despite the tasty selections, the place is horribly managed. They have staff running around with little direction as if they're chickens with no heads. Please don't read into I am knocking the staff they certainly did all they could to keep this house of cards from collapsing.",1
What can I say about the service here. HORRIBLE. The managers don't seem to care either. Some of their policy's are ridiculous. Support you mom and pop shops in your local area. These big corporate companies love to drain our money out into their outside bank accounts and we don't see it back.,1
"We came here for drinks and appetizers. We chose the oysters because our waitress suggested them. I loved the vibe in this place. It was fun without being serious or thinking too much of itself since it was on the strip. n nThe food, the service and the ambiance was great. i would definitely come back here when i'm in vegas.",2
"Food is not bad, service is good and bad, depends on what time during the day you are going. But this is the BEST place to get Boba in AZ!",2
"Delicious chopped salad. You Must order this salad! It is the same as citizen public house but waaaaaay better. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think the menu could be better. It has staple items to order which it does amazingly like the mushroom dish, the chopped salad, and a few others but overall options are limited. n nI prefer it for lunch personally because of the chopped salad.",2
"Love this salon! n nI went here my first time as a college student using a Groupon. Candace trimmed, glazed, and styled my hair. She is absolutely amazing. If you ever need a perfect blowout she's the best around. n nI highly recommend this place. The salon is located right under the W6 and the prices are affordable.",2
"They have a great buffet. My Aunt used to live in Vegas and this is one of the ""locals "" casinos they always went to. The place was always clean. My mom and I did stay there once and the room was nice as well.",2
"The food at Carlito's is OK. I can't think of anything better to say about it. n nThe green chile is New Mexico chile, cooked a little untraditionally, but close enough to the real thing, that someone who has lived in New Mexico finds it somewhat familiar, but lacking the gustatory punch of really well prepared New Mexican green chile. n nThe flour tortillas are of poor quality and have a tendency to fall apart. The refried beans are so bland they border on baby food. And the atmosphere, well, it's like a taqueria noisy, cheap, crowded. n nIt's good for someone looking for a green chile fix, but probably not the place to eat for really good New Mexican food",1
"Went in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The Conservative is DELICIOUS and their salads are excellent as well. The menu is a bit pricey, but fair given the large portion size. I would have preferred a smaller portion with less cost. Definitely would recommend Layers to anyone looking for a yummy lunch.",2
"My boyfriend and I live pretty close to Komol so we go here a lot. The servers are nice, food is great, and the lunch specials are super affordable. They have great soy shrimp and the vegetarian appetizer sampler is awesome! Tempura spinach, yes please! They aren't very consistent with the spicy levels but other than that, I love this place!",2
"Was just driving through the Verrado area with my family and came across this great restaurant. n nWe enjoyed the pizza's that we ordered. It's a little greasy, but that was over looked by the great taste. I love thin crust pizza and it was a little burnt from the brick oven. I loved that burnt taste, to me it just adds a little extra flavor to the pizza. The only complaint I have is that the soda was flat. n nThe wait staff was great. I'm horrible with names and I can't remember for the life me. She was a very pretty brunette with a nice smile. She was very attentive to our table and very nice. Also, we meet the owner as he was energetic and was greeting everyone there. It was a very welcoming feeling in there. n nCan't wait to go again.Mmmmm love the pizza!",2
"The food is amazing! The service tends to be hit or miss, but let's be honest.most people don't go to Pita Jungle for the service. We always get hummus with grilled chicken which is amazing! , but last time I ordered the fruit platter for my five year old. It was huge. Between three adults and one five year old, we put a small dent on the fruits and cheeses, but it was delicious. Everything is fresh and yummy.",2
Cute little cupcake shop located in the Pittsburgh Public Market. I got the Drunken Oatmeal and Hop In Lime cupcakes both were delicious! I also got a bag of small cranberry filled penny sized cookies these were yummy and perfect to go with a cup of tea. Her baked goods are very unique and the alcohol flavor is light and not overpowering.,2
"This is my favorite shop in Phoenix. It houses Eastside Records and many 10? other vendors in the same vein as Crossroads in Portland. They've got tons of new used records, tapes, audio gear, clothing and books. For the most part though, it is a record store with a great selection and good prices. I would say that the majority of the records are used, but they also have good new releases and reissues. The Punk, Jazz and Reggae sections are huge compared with anyone else in town. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and there's always new stuff in the new arrivals bin when I stop by.",2
The large cheese pizza and zeppoli's were great. The service from Stacy was spectacular!,2
Lots of adjectives come to mind. Dumpy. Ancient. Moldy. Quite far from the heart of downtown by Charlotte standards . Most rooms don't even have a minibar. Nor do they have nice TVs. n nThe wifi speed was decent though. That's always a plus.,1
"Now I've been to at least 2 dozen Vegas buffets, and consider myself somewhat of a Vegas buffet connoisseur.and this is the first one that has caused me to say ""Wow, that isn't worth anywhere near what I paid! "" At most Vegas buffets, you get more or less what you pay for. My main area of expertise is the Champagne Brunch, and Vegas has quite the variety. I've seen everything from the 8.99 Sahara RIP that served their champagne in plastic cups from some bizarre powdery mixture, to the Bellagio, which for 25 will get you a good selection of high quality food and the coldest milk money can buy, to the Wynn, where 45 will get you every bizarre food under the sun yet somehow omit the one food you crave most at any brunch buffet.bacon . n nAnyways.The Flamingo buffet hits bottom rung in pretty much every category. Poor selection, poor quality, high price, and to top it off you have to pay 10 extra for champagne unless you happen to be a diamond Total Rewards member ! At 25 plus 10 for champagne, you get basically the smallest buffet in Vegas. They do throw a few crab legs and shrimp in to justify the price, but don't be fooled. They were well below average quality, even for buffet standards. And the rest of the buffet is no better.I've seen 10 Fremont strip buffets with twice the selection and better quality! n nThe wait staff was friendly and attentive, so I have no qualms there. However, they were balanced off by the surly crepe chef. I get to the front of the line and ask for my crepe with ""everything "". She says, ""Everything? "" I say , ""Yes, everything, "" and point to each of the toppings apple, strawberry, chocolate, whipped cream, and nutella . She gets angry, throws strawberries and chocolate on my crepe, and yells, ""Next! "" Who does that? It doesn't cost you anything. Even if you think the combination is disgusting, just throw the junk on the crepe and the drunk idiot will go away and be happy. Now you made him sad. n nSo if you happen to be in the market for a champagne brunch, pass by this one and don't look back. There are plenty more that are well worth your while.TI, Paris, Aria, Planet Hollywood.just to name a few.",1
"we tried Kneaders two times, both times not impressed. Soggy bread, uncooked pastries, we will not go back. Service was ""directive instead of suggestive "" the clients that were there each time were more interested in our conversations then keeping to themselves while we were eating. n nIf I even get a weak moment and try it again I will re review.",1
Good hardy home cooked food. the atmosphere is non descripted but good food for business traveler. Very friendly staff,2

"If you were to ask me about my in store purchase and customer service I would have said it was great. However that all changed once they had my money and the purchase was complete. I spent nearly 3,000 on a sectional over Memorial Day weekend and was told that my order would take at most 14 weeks but that most orders take around 6 weeks. So at the end of July I call and I'm told August 21st is my delivery date. I call back at the end of August it took three messages and calls to reach my salesmen and he says he's been trying to call me but my phone was broken it wasn't, I've had the same phone for 10 years . Then he tells me it will be September 21st. I begrudgingly agree since this is the maximum timeline in the 14 weeks. Now here we are, its the end of September and I call again today and I'm told 2 4 more weeks. I tried to talk to the manager and express my dissatisfaction and he stood there silent on the other end of the phone offering no concern or effort to expedite my shipment. Bottom line once the sale is final and they have your money they put zero effort in helping you. Meanwhile here I sit on the floor 4 months after my purchase and I still have another month to go that is if this time quote is accurate ! I recommend taking your business elsewhere. Somewhere where customer service is more than a smile to get the sale.",1
"Well for my first time to vegas I wasn't sure what to expect, but I do know Ive had better hotel rooms for better prices for what my boyfriend and I payed for a week at the Luxor. n nI'm not gonna completely diss the Luxor It is a decent tourist attraction hotel stay, but for what you pay it's not worth it, e changed rooms twice and our other friends changed 4 times, now that's obnoxious who wants to change even once. NO ONE. no internet, no fridge, the pillows sucked, the bath tub clogged and there was tones of noise, you could hear everything. n nFor an older couple maybe it's not that bad, but foe younger couples it's definitely not the place to stay, LAX i swear on my life played the same music in the same exact order no lie 3 nights in a row. and Saturday nights are like a sardine can. It's at the end of the south strip so thank god for the rental car we got or else we wouldn't of seen anything. you are too far from things to walk everywhere and who wants to pay for cabs for a week.overall it was just ok",1

"The food was a solid 4 maybe 4.5 stars but our service was. well we really didn't have any. Delightful greeting and he did take our order in good time. But then we were abandoned. We begged for a tea refill by flagging down another server. We could not get the check and our server never returned after our brunch was served. To add insult we noticed hot beignets being sent to tables at the end of service. We inquired of the maitre de on the way out and he seemed surprised we were not offered any. To his credit he offered to pack up some to go, but we were over it by this time. n A pretty place and the food was very nicely done, but at 50 a pop per person for brunch you ought to be able to get a refill on the ice tea.",1
"I can't believe this place closed! I was so excited to write a review and use my new favorite word, ""douschebaggery "" when explaining the scene. Oh, this place was so seedy. Tons of guidos and I swear they LOVED to wear all white. n nIf I could, I would have given this place zero stars. n nI guess I'm happy they closed down because it was a long time coming. This place was so over the top. The process of getting in was always annoying. You'd HAVE to valet your car and then upon entry there would be way too many people bombarding you in the entry way. n nThe location's a bit off the main strip of clubs in Scottsdale and I always found it weird to be on Drinkwater when I'd go out to the patio section. n nAnyway, I'm just crossing my fingers now that who ever buys the property gut the inside and make into some trendy hipster bar lounge!",1

"Stay away! Took my dog to get groomed, they cut her ear and clip her against the hair. 50.00 never again. Plus the dog food is very exepenseive. The sales help is very inexperienced!",1
"i am very disappointed with the service. i waited 45 minutes for 3 orders. and take note its ""take out "". the crew are running around cos there are a lot of people. well every crew has to have there own station. and the receptionist is out of sight. there were still people coming in and waiting to be sitted. but the receptionist is inside the kitchen making orders. management sucks. not organized at all. people are waiting, orders are not taken in time. like seriously? its not an excuse that you are busy and helping others. you panic because you are not organized. not really worth the wait.",1
"This place was initially planned out as a ""drink "" spot before we began our debauchery like antics in Vegas for that day, but turned out to be our dining spot as well. n nBefore you start planning to eat here, please note that if you go to www.restaurant.com you can purchase a coupon which allows you to have a portion of your bill taken off if you spend ""x "" amount of dollars AND THIS INCLUDES ALCOHOL! That's the only reason this place was considered prior to our group taking the trip to Vegas. Our coupon was a 100 gift certificate for 200 or more of food and drink. n nSo now for the food.it was.well, good! Quite a few of us had the turkey burger we added guacamole . There was nothing super extravagant about it, but it was definitely a good turkey burger. Our table had the trifecta of fries fresh cut, garlic herb, and sweet potato. The sweet potato fries were the only ones that did not get devoured. They just didn't work for us. Kinda gross actually. A few of us actually went back the next day for late night eats. I had the Ahi Tuna burger. Good and unique tasting, but that's all. Just.good. n nNow, if you're a drinker you might have came to the right place! The Jumbo Cocktails will get you where you need to go.if you're choosing to go ""there "" this is where the restaurant.com coupon really comes in handy . They come in 16 and 32oz. mason jars. The 32oz. Tableside Margarita won't disappoint you! Also, be careful! Some of the people in our party had some drinks that were not too tasty. I'm not sure which ones they are, but get a quick taste before your waiter waitress leaves the table in case you need to send it back and order something else. n nOverall, it was a great experience! Great waiter, great atmosphere, great weather, great drinks, and uh.good food ",2
"Good for a dessert place, bad for food. n nCame here on a Sunday for brunch super hungry. We waited 30 minutes to be seated and ended up sitting outside on the patio in 106 degree heat. While they have fans with water misters, they don't reach certain tables. I had to ask the hostess to move to a better table where we would get at least some mist. The outside patio is covered by a pink tarp which gave everything a bright pink glare. Bring sunglasses! n nWe were starving by the time we were seated. We waited 5 minutes for a server to take our drink order. By this time we already knew what we wanted to order so we placed our order. I got an LEO omelet and the main squeeze ordered a burger. It took 10 minutes for us to get our water and another 10 minutes to get our food. My omelet was all egg and hardly any onions and salmon. It tasted dry and salty. The burger was okay. It seemed like forever until we found the waitress to ask for our check. We ordered a cookies and cream milkshake to go. That came back 5 minutes later along with our check. n nMy experience here was pretty bad. I feel like it was a waste of time and energy sitting around waiting, waiting, and waiting for food that wasn't even good. The best part of the whole experience was the milkshake it was delicious.",1
managers are rude. n nhotel staff needs a course in customer service. n nmake the drive to the 7077 Mayo Blvd Store. n nthats all i have to say about this location.,1
"I love the food here. I've been to one in San Diego and it was just as good. Although, I do have to admit that our server at this location looked a little worn out. I could tell that she was tired and ready to get the hell outa there. n nWe were sat right away a week from today on the patio. Upon being sat we noticed that they were nearing closing time. I ordered the medicine man drink and we started with a vegetable crudites but substituted the hummus. The server forgot to sub it but it was remedied right away. n nI did, however, love my medicine man drink. n nTo follow I got the chicken chopped salad. It definitely was an amazing salad. I loved the sweetness of the dates along with the sharp flavor of the champagne vinaigrette. n nNearing the end of our dinner we were offered dessert. Normally one would wait until the guest is all finished but we weren't too bothered. We were full anyways! haha. I thought it was a nice gesture of the server to offer us free food and drink that was going to be thrown out anyways. I love how they try not to waste!",2
"My girlfriend and I walked into this pub after Zips was packed on a Sunday afternoon. We were starving and didn't want to drive anywhere else so we figured we'd try Clancy's. This was our first mistake. Strip mall bar is complement for this dump. The projector TV on the wall was faded, barely visible, and of course the one TV with the Cardinals game on was back under it's dingy bar so it was barely visible. n nFood We ordered the Hot Wings, Pepper Jack Burger, and for an appetizer Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole. All of these bar munchies are basically impossible to screw up by anyone not drooling on themselves or riding a short bus yet this place managed to ruin all three. The wings seemed like they were microwaved and barely had any sauce on them. The burger showed up with meat, cheese, and a bun. I was graciously provided rubbery pickles but apparently lettuce and tomato aren't grown in this section of Scottsdale as they were noticably missing. But lets get to the best part.the guacamole. To say this stuff was brown and disgusting would be an insult to the Coach Purses and Skin of the Scottdale women everywhere. This wasn't just a dusting of top that could be scraped off but was through and through this deliciously looking turd treat. n nNeedless to say I'll never return to this culinary hell hole unless I lose a bet that will benefit special need puppies.",1
SERIOUSLY ew. Rude and inappropriate.,1
Capriotti's has the best turkey sub in all of America. They roast their turkeys everyday and the white rolls are of top quality. Go ahead and order the two footer you won't be disappointed. That's a whole days worth of food right there.,2

"WHAT? There are no entries here yet! Are you all asleep or hiding this little gem?! n nOver in the south side of town, across the Mon' Monogahela river, next to the Incline in the Station Square shopping area you will find a lovely Italian Restaurant called ""Buca Di Beppo. "" Now, I know many of you are saying this is just a small chain restaurant but I don't give a farthing. They have some of the BEST italian food served FAMILY style that you have ever had. n nThe thought of their potato Gnocchi has me drooling right now. n nWe went last Sunday night, as a group of about ten, and ordered some garlic cheese bread, beer and iced tea. The party never stopped from that point on. The wait staff were very helpful, patient, and courteous to a fault! Thank goodness for these people alone. but wait. the food is fantastic! And it's served in large or small portions so you can eat family style and pass the dishes around, or keep one just for yourself. n nWe had Cantiloni, Gnocchi, stuffed shells, chicken parmegain, pizza, fetticini alfredo. oh man, was this food good! I walked away patting my stretched tummy, and felt like a very blessed man. n nSeriously. I want more of their Gnocchi. I didn't get enough. The prices were also very moderate, since we got out of there with drinks and appitizer for 20 each. n nHint If the weather is nice, ask to be seated outside against the street side and you can see the hillside near the incline. It's a nice view, and great if you have as large group too!",2
"So it was my girlfriends birthday and we decided, after much browsing and walking around, to try out Olives, and boy am I glad we did. Every part of the meal was fantastic, from the drinks, appetizers, main course, to the complimentary birthcake dessert. I was going to try the beef tartare, but at the suggestion of our fantastic waiter, we got the beef carpaccio. Delicious is all I can say. The waiter found out that we were in the food industry so when we ordered the flat bread he brought out a Trio dish with fig and prosciutto, olives classic, and portabello. Downright amazing is all I can say. Since my girlfriend is a part time vegetarian she got the Pasta butternut squash tortelli, and she loved it. I ordered the rabbit dish, which is a first for me, and the flavors were delicious. Todd English himself might be phoning it in at this point in his career, but the Chefs and cooks at Olives are more than covering his ass. Fantastic job folks.",2
"I've never ordered online, so I don't have any comments on that. n nThe store in Toronto is awesome. There's a barber and a cafe in it. n nThe clothing line itself is a trend setter and I can walk out of there and fit right in on Queen West, arguably one of the world's trendiest fashion areas. I can also walk out of there dressed to impress at work. n nThe prices are also really fair. You can get a perfect dress shirt for 30 bucks off their sales rack. The only thing that I found to be badly priced was a pair of 155 dollar sneakers.loved the sneakers though. n nThe staff are helpful and the space is great. You can definitely build a wardrobe here.",2
"Last night, my friends and I had the amazing opportunity to see O.A.R. and Gogol Bordello for free! O.A.R. started the evening off right! Such a great show and full of energy, energy that built up my appetite. Between shows, my friends and I decided to walk the Linq and check out Haute Doggery for bite to eat. n nFirst off, when you hear the name Haute Doggery, you think gourmet. You think, wow, that's a cool spin to a hot dog. That's what originally caught our curiosity. Hot dogs are an American classic. When there's a spin like that, you can't help but walk in and try them out! Walking into the place, you notice the bright accents around the room. White table tops, wooden trimmings and bright red chairs. The focal point to the place is the hot dog artwork to the back of the room. I thought at first sight, this place looked awesome! Then it was time to order. n nTHE BIGGEST, and I mean the biggest turn off for me are non engaged employees. When I walked up to the counter, the lady taking our order was texting on her cell phone! Clear as day, it looked like she was hiding from her coworkers, but didn't care about doing that in front of her customers. I took a picture and posted it onto the business page for proof. If you zoom into the picture, she wasn't texting anything professional. The conversation via text was about some drama. WHAT. A. TURN. OFF. That should NEVER happen. Unacceptable. She let me stand there for a good 30 seconds before saying something. When she did, she said, ""Don't worry, I can hear you. Go ahead and order, "" WHILE SHE CONTINUED TO TEXT. Ugh, I'm sorry for the rant, I just felt cheap and unimportant at that moment. Not good for this business. That may be the reason why they just opened in the Linq and so far have an overall Yelp score of 2.5 stars. n nAside from that, here's what I got for my meal n n Crinkle Cut French Fries for 3.99 the big disappointment with these fries that they weren't fresh cut fries. If the business is going to advertise themselves as a step up from the normal hot dog joint, well then I would expect them to have stellar, fresh cut ingredients. n n Tijuana Dog for 7.29 When I did get the opportunity to talk with the hostess, I asked her between this dog and the Gold Standard dog advertised on their business page on TheLinq.com. She told me hands down, this dog. This dog was bacon wrapped and deep fried, topped with grilled onions, jalapeno and mayo. The jalapenos weren't overly hot and coupled with the onions, it brought a nice crunchy texture. One of my favorite guilty pleasures is eating a hot dog with mayo. This was no different and super delicious! Although the hot dog was bacon wrapped, which I LOVED, the dog was super small. It had a nice snap to it, but unfortunately for me, it got lost in the mix of ingredients and wasn't the true star of the show. n nThe word Haute means, ""fashionably elegant or high class, "" depicted by Websters. This place was inspired by the famous Holstein's menu and to me, a huge disappointment. I appreciate their overall take on the American classic. I really wished the experience was much better than what I saw, heard and tasted that day. For the strip, I would say the price is on point, however, not worth the return visit in my opinion.",1
I keep hearing this place is good. I keep finding it's bad. Even the margaritas.,1
"Oh, the bar that tries way too hard. On the first floor of the Constellation Apartments, I am sure the owners thought they would be pulling in the residents that live above but during the times I have been there, this wasn't the case. The decor is a mismatch of reclaimed lumber, industrial lights, ikea shelves and random pez dispensers. Trying to be hip? Trying to be ironic? Trying to be urban? No clue. The last visit, there were several wines that were not available yet were printed on the menu. The same goes with one beer tap. When asked, the bartender simply replied, ""They don't tell me these things "". nI guess if you lived above and there was a monsoon, tornado, or other severe weather event, it would be ok to come here. Otherwise, go to any number of places in Madison that are truly authentic and deliver a great experience.",1
The cheapest hotel for a Memorial Day weekend. I dont think I would come back here. The sink water had an odor and tasted like burnt rubber tires. Ewww I cant believe I brushed my teeth with that water!,1
Fabulous Sunday Brunch! The staff was friendly and attentive although our server disappeared for long periods of time . Great experience and I would definitely go back. Request to sit inside on particularly hot days.,2
"LOVED my experience here! The food, atmosphere and service was amazing! n nAs soon as I walked in I felt so welcomed and cozy, like I was having breakfast at a friends or something. Mugs are already on the table. And the mugs aren't like your dainty little coffee cups that you have to keep asking refills for, they're cute mugs that have their logo on it. n nThe menu offered so many options and it took us almost 10 minutes to figure out what to eat. I eventually decided to get a skillet and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Goodness. The portions are HUGE! Definitely one of those, save half for lunch kind of places. The skillet was sooo good. Melted cheese on potatoes, avocado, ham.my oh my. n nIf you check in here, you also get a free banana nut muffin which is definitely worth a try! I love banana nut muffins and the ones they make here are pretty top notch. n nI would definitely come here again, if I wanted to get away from the strip and have a relaxing breakfast.",2
Great Service! I bought sever vehicles from here and always have a great experience.,2
"As a Sun Devil alum, staff member, and athletics fan, I have found myself in Wells Fargo Arena for men's basketball games throughout the last six years and occasional women's basketball games . While I have been in much larger arenas, I think the Wells Fargo Arena is a great venue that isn't too large and isn't too small. Having just been to the rival basketball game U of A at ASU , almost the entire arena was filled, and there was much spirit and passion on the parts of both sets of fans. Definitely a fun time! n nI have also enjoyed events in Wells Fargo Arena including the residential move in experience, Sun Devil Welcome, student concerts, and graduation ceremonies. The arena is built in such a way that there is great flexibility in its layout and each year, ASU upgrades the arena a bit. Last year, a new mini food court was added on the east side of the arena.",2
We were looking to enjoy the concert at the mall using the San Felipe Cantinas patio. The manager was Extremely rude and told us that unless we were going to order an entree we would not be allowed to dine at his restaurant. We had full intentions of ordering drinks and appetizers. With an attitude like that we took our business across the courtyard to Cadillac Ranch. Excellent food and very courteous staff.,1
"I've been eating here for almost seven years , they have been very consistent and have been one of my favorite places to eat Chinese fast food , the shrimp fried rice has always been my favorite , and the waitress there has always been very good to me not to mention she is nice on the eyes .",2
"Pros Clean and efficient, they get you on quickly. The LINQ area and shops are very nice. n nCons Price 96 for 3 with local discount . View honestly isn't that great, it's on the back side of the strip and frankly you see a lot of the parking lot until you're about half way up. n nUnderwhelmed",1
"We've been coming to this particular location for over 7 years at least 3 times a month because we always received the best service from our server, Fey, who just happened to not be working this evening. we were looking forward to having the ""2 for 29 "" entree wine dinner. When we arrived, there were only 2 parties of 2 dining. There were 3 servers no manager. We received no greeting were told to take the 4th booth on the left. We were neither walked to our booth nor handed menu, whatsoever. We sat for 15 minutes without one serving coming over to us at all, not even to give us a menu or even offer us water. We both stood up walked around still every server ignored us. We stood at the cashier counter for about another 5 minutes, expecting the friendly attentive manager who usually checks us out so we could make him aware of our disappointment. all 3 servers walked by still ignored us. so, we left landed at to Coco's on Bell Rd. 98th Ave., only to be greeted served as we're to be served. When Fey isn't there, things are not up to par.",1
"My husband and I decided to try Regions after seeing that they had reopened. The whole experience was just disapointing. The food was uninspired and below average, the prices high, and the service mediocre. I can think of at least five restaurants within a five minute drive of Regions that blow this place out of the water. One out of five stars ONLY because it wouldn't let me leave zero.",1
"Great atmosphere, great talent behind the bar, excellent food! Treavor and Jon are bartenders that rock!",2
"Love it! nIt's great to grab a bite for lunch. nLove all the different salsas! nPrices are reasonable nTV is too loud most of the time, but I can overlook that I guess. Just is hard to even have a conversation at the table. nAll in all Great place! nI think I'll go there for lunch today!",2
"This is an automatic stop for family every time we are staying at the Palazzo. We come here for lunch or a quick hot noodles fix after a late night drinking. Their noodle soup are very tasty and delicious which always hit the spot. Love the fact they close late at 3am. This was our first stop after checking in the hotel so will definitely be back after drinking tonight. They also have Pho but soup base seems a watered down and not the best out there. Some of my favorites includes Shrimp Fried Rice, Beef Congee and the Duck Noodle Soup.",2
Ordered the hakkah fried rice Ginger chili tofu and the Curry noodle The portions were tiny AND food was very oily. Would never order from here again,1
"There is ROT associated with this hotel. n nThe superficial elements are one thing and they leave much to be desired but rather u00a0I'm talking instead about its management, and some very nasty tactics they used to tack over a hundred dollars in extra fees onto a PRE PAID hotel bill. The whole incident was very ""unkosher, "" to put it nicely. I'd use a harsher term, but I'll refrain here.you can probably imagine. I have the backup in writing, so I've taken the matter to my credit card company. But adding insult to injury, the hotel's Assistant Manager stood back and said ""Not our problem. "" Such actions should be condemned in the strongest possible terms, if only because they are the precise opposite of hospitality. Disgusting. Despicable. Worth avoiding by staying elsewhere. n nIf someone from the hotel were to contact me I can provide additional details, including the names of the individuals in question.",1
"Actually, I was pleasantly surprised. Four of us got a killer deal of three nights plus airfare for about the same price as airfare alone. I mentioned to a few people where we would be staying, and got the Ewww looks. We normally stay at Harrah's due to their generous comping system, and it's always nice. But, I figured, the hotel is just a place to crash, it just needs to be decent. n nIt was decent. The rooms were clean. Housekeeping was prompt when we requested extra amenities. The water pressure was good and the water was hot. n nSo, why only 2 stars? 1 95 of the employees act like they hate their job and they don't care who knows it. 2 There was some draining problem in the shower and you wound up with 3 inches of water with each shower. 3 The casino only tracks table games if you play 25 hand. I have a ""system "" in Pai Gow and vary my bets, and this rule seems unnecessarily elitist. All MGM Mirage owned hotels are the same 4 Housekeeping knocked inappropriately. when we had Do Not Disturb on and when we called down and asked housekeeping to skip us. Girls need their sleep, dammit.",1
"Made reservations for this place a week in advance BF asked for a window table and everything was confirmed and ready to go. We went there on a Thur in the evening in attempts to ""beat the crowd "" when we walked in the place was empty typical for a weekday we gave the hostess she was nice out name and she asked another lady a question quietly NOW as l mentioned before the place was EMPTY only one other table. She quickly sat us in the first table closest to the register hostess station, which was weird because we specifically asked for and confirmed a window table guess we looked like we might run out on the bill nWe took that in stride and just tried to enjoy the meal, food was decent enough, filet mignon was nicely cooked but lobster Mac and cheese was the highlight. The server was nice but he NEVER checked on us, we both had salads to start, entree and a dessert and he NEVER refilled out drink even ONCE never even asked if we needed anything else. Needless to say the service was less than perfect, guess we also look like bad tippers. We have been to and frequented MANY fine dining establishments in Vegas and this is by far the worst l was ever treated. lm never going back, the service was horrible and they seem too presumptuous and judgmental. Don't go here l would try Tender at the Luxor or even Delfrisco's for better food and service",1
This is the worst airline I have ever used. Booked flight for my wife to visit her sick dad. That flight was two hours late. Booked her return flight and it is four hours taking off. I couldn't see how to post negative numbers for he review,1
This is a great place for a fun evening with friends. The food is fantastic and they serve large portions. I love the Lobster BLT with generous portion of lobster. I'm also a fan of their beignets. You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Highly recommended. Just make sure you make reservations otherwise you can wait anywhere between 30 to 45 min.,2
"First there was Pepe's Tacos, then there was Tacos El Gordo and now there's this! Best part is the restaurant being only a block away from where I live so I don't have to drive all the way up north for damn good tacos. Located at the former Republic Kitchen Bar establishment along South Eastern Blvd, this is definitely one of the better looking taco shops out there. I like how the new occupants kept the same floor plan from the old bar and added few Latin modifications to suit their concept. Plenty of seats downstairs, upstairs and even outside. n nThis place has several stations for certain cuts of meats from which you can order any way you desire taco, burrito, nachos, fries, bowl, and vampiro. Salsa bar is also impressive with various sides and 8 different sauces! Thirsty? They have a full bar and an extensive list of beer on tap or in a bottle. Happy hour is from 6 8 p.m. daily with live mariachi on Mondays and DJ spinning on weekends. n nI always get tacos with cabeza head , lengua tough and chicharron skin anywhere I go so I had to try them out from this place. The first two were quite tasty and really tender. As far as the chicharron, they actually add crispy pork rinds which was a first since other taquerias normally just serve the taco with soggy pork skins. What also got me hyped up is the fact that they have elotes since I no longer have to track down this dude who sells them from a shopping cart! n nOverall, Taco Y Taco is one of the best Mexican joints in the valley. I would give them six stars if I could.",2
"i ve been three times and think it's overpriced. the atmosphere is cold and whitewashed. We went Saturday for my friend's birthday and the bartender, who she knew, offered to make her a special drink send over food, which in my experience means you are going to be comped. At the end of the night we were charged 30 for a meat cheese plate that we never ordered. While I may be perceived as another whiny pittsburgher who doesn't get good food and good drink, I will argue that having traveled all over the world and spent a good deal of time living in new york and boston, I've experienced plenty of delicious food and drink and you don't need to spend 120 on a night out. A 12 3 sip cocktail is b o r i n g, unoriginal and overrated.",1
Worst Cab Service ever. Ronda was the RUDEST person ever on the phone. Please someone just put them out of service already.,1
"Okay I have been going here for years now. Three years ago, I went vegetarian and they still had ""spring rolls "" on their menu. So, whenever I go in and order menu less, I usually get veggie lo mein and order some ""spring rolls. "" I have not been corrected by terminology in the last couple years I have no idea when they changed their menu because their ""spring rolls "" are NOT, NOT, NOT VEGETARIAN! They now put chicken in their rolls, it is just ground up so incredibly fine and overloaded with rice noodles and carrots. I now finally found out the reason why I always feel ill after eating at this place. Sorry Big Buddha, it's time to cut ties.",1
"Ordered the Chicken Piccata which is supposed to come with the chicken, potatoes and fresh veggies. The veggies never made the plate. In addition, they don't have Jack Daniels apparently corporate decided not to carry it and to go with Jim Beam. Seriously, who doesn't have jack? n nThe food is poor quality. It reminds me of a cracker barrel.",1
"So. I would have posted pictures, but devoured everything before I could remember, lol. n nThe food is AMAZING! The service is great also.

"Cool furnishing store with modern designs. You'll find a lot of unique items, whether it's a bed, coffee table, or decorative item. Prices are fair, since you are paying a little more for the unique aspect, plus the higher quality.",2
"If I can give this place 0 stars, I would! Also, if I was a health inspector, I would definitely shut this restaurant down. After I already paid, I noticed that there were packages of beef sitting in a bin on the floor. Another set of packages were on a cart next to bottles of Clorox Bleach. This is not the way to thaw meat! The cashier also was eating behind the counter! nI will definitely reach out to Quiznos and let them know that these people who lack knowledge of food safety can potentially harm customers with a foodborne illness!",1
"I came here to eat with my family on Wednesday and I'm a HUGE fan of this place, not just becasue its pretty much the only Argentinean restaurant in Vegas but because they actually have great food. n nTheir Chimichurri is DELISH! For an afternoon lunch, I recommend their sandwiches with a cafe con leche, which is yummy. I usually order their hot pastrami sandwich or the especial churrasco. My man loves their Lomito completo sandwich. The empanadas are very good too just a little too much for such a small empanada because they cost 2.25 each and I just think they should be a little bit less. n nFor dinner they have the Parrillada which is just delicious, I highly recommend it. Only thing is, that in my opinion its a little expensive since it doesn't come with any sides, just the meat. n nOverall its a nice little Argentinean restaurant deli and the staff is very friendly which makes people want to go back and thats definitely a plus.",2
"four stars only because the calamari is too good it's soo expensive. i like the bbq meat and egg roll on vermicelli noodles. my mouth is watering just thinking about it nOH and definitely DO NOT GO ON sunday between 9am 3pm. it's like rush hour. we went last sunday and i couldn't even make it to the front door. unfortunately, we left. but it's not enough to keep me away for good",2
Very nice inviting unique atmosphere. Breakfast on 4 4 12. Busy at 9 am as it should be. Michel Richard is a culinary icon and it shows.

Poolside service is great and there are always waitstaff bringing you pitchers of water and ready to take your order. Get the kobe burger with fries! There was no steak salad on the poolside menu so I have no idea what the previous reviewers were raving about. There are also a ton of koi fish in the pond leading to the canyon villas. If you ask the pool staff, they might let you feed them with what looks like miniature dog food pellets.

"I love this place, not only do they have an amazing selection but their prices are always great, My stepfather works at a liquor store and he even comes here to buy his booze. The other day I came in here with some friends and we bought this new whip cream infused with alcohol. well all the air had been let out of the container or something because it was coming out pure liquid. We brought it back and they exchanged it for us. They didn't have to but they did, it was very delicious and got a lot of attention being the drunk messes that we are when we brought it out on the town with us.",2
"There is not much to say other than AWESOME tour! n nThe guide takes you to a couple of different stops 1st one being the Hover Damn, 2nd one being a Chocolate Factory an extremely small one, more like a rest stop, but still good chocolate , and then last but of course not lease the Grand Canyon. n nOnce you get to the Grand Canyon you get to visit the souvenir shop, the sky walk if you are on the Grand Canyon West tour , the ranch where they can serve you lunch and then to a special section that only pink jeep tours are able to go. This is the best part, because you don't have to fight through the crowds to take pictures, since you are only with the group of nine people who are on your tour bus. The guide will bring you on a short 10 15 minute hike and is willing to take loads of pictures for you. The guide also knows a ton of information they literally talk the whole time telling you different things about Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, the animals, people, and plants in the area. Anything and everything you can think about they talk to you about. It's a bit more pricey than the other tours, but it is defiantly worth the money!",2
"Pizza review only! n n1 Their beer tastes good n2 Their entres look like stuff you'd find anywhere else and at least smelled and looked good n3 The place looks nice n nBUT.the pizza claiming to be ""Authentic Chicago Deep Dish "".sucks.think Personal Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut.remember the doughy texture, the flavor, the look, etc.then you've eaten Old Chicago's deep sigh.just a waste.AND the personal pan which the waitress said she 'split' with her friends cuz it was sooooooo much ran me almost 13 and barely filled me up. n nHowever, I would go back to try their other offerings.if I have time.",1
"4.5 Stars All Day Long. And who wouldn't want a Spiced Calvados Sidecar to help kickstart the holidays? I know I did. Although contrary to the azcentral article http tinyurl.com 2fy6m5w ""Best holiday drinks around the Northeast Valley "", the rim was not frozen and in fact, the bartender had no idea what I was talking about when I asked for the cocktail. But in all fairness, they've been open just over a week. After a few minutes of asking around she quickly corrected herself and not only apologized but bought my first drink! Whew! I knew I had done my homework. And the drink was amazing. n nWe went for the full dining experience at Local Bistro. Started out with the Beef Carpaccio which was topped with arugula, parmiggiano, fried caper berries and drizzled with truffle oil. First time EVER even hearing about a caperberry. Basically, ""capers "" are young buds of the caper bush. If they grow large enough, they become caperberries which when fried, reminded me of okra, with a hint of tartness like olives, larger pearl like seeds.inside with a slight sticky texture. Interesting! I love parmigiano so that was a no brainer but the arugula was fresh, delicious, and paired nicely with the carpaccio. n nFor an entree how about some pan seared sea bass with seasonal veggies topped with a vanilla beurre blanc? Killer. Added a side of Spinach which was sauteed in olive oil with garlic and granada padano.the infamous italian cheese that is similar to parmiggiano with a few different distinct qualities. Great flavor, prepared nicely. Well done and priced at 24. n nI couldn't leave without trying dessert. They had I ""I want them all "" for 40 which would give you all the desserts.but I chose from the list the most unique which happened to be the Nutella Calzone. It was wood fired, stuffed with nutella, served with berries and I think it was supposed to be topped with vanilla gelato, although ours was served without? And I don't remember the name of the cocktail but I had a dessert cocktail which included a biscotti liquor. Delish. Still my favorite was the spiced sidecar.well worth the venture up north. n nIt was completely out of my hood but I am determined to try all the 10 hot spots for unique holiday cocktails. If I'm ever in the area I'll definitely be back and I would highly recommend for anyone in the neighborhood. I'd be there often!",2
"This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House. Great food with excellent customer service. My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non clean district manager Kyle I was told is his name ",2
"This is probably the most beautiful Ritz carlton I have stayed. I have stayed in quite a few but this design is very handsome city savvy. The lobby is a great place to share a drink and stories with someone and the room I stayed in was like a penthouse, the only think missing was a kitchen. n nCheck out the television that appears in the mirror while you are shaving or brushing your teeth. And how about that italian expresso machine in the lobby area of the room. Amazing.",2
"Been here for 2.5 days with my MIL and everyone has been extraordinarily nice, the care has been exemplary, and I'm confused at the negative reviews I read prior to posting this. n nI guess a working understanding of medical care offers perspective and reduces entitlement. YMMV.",2
"Solid food at a fair price. In some ways it's just glorified bar food burgers, sandwiches, etc with a few entrees to choose from salmon, steak . I had the pork chimichurri sandwich, which was delicious as usual. I appreciate the rice black beans on the side a nice change over the usual french fries. I also had a mojito, which was decent, but probably not worth the price. 8 works upstairs, but seems a bit overpriced for this space. n nThe only low point of the visit was the service. We wandered in after a show at the Comedy Club on State, about 15 minutes before the posted closing time. The bartender informed us they were just about to close. We said we'd be fast, and so we were seated at a table. The waiter came over and immediately says, ""Do you know what you want? "", before we had even been handed menus. Tacky. The service didn't improve from there slow, inattentive, etc . n nI don't know that I would bring guests here looking for an amazing dinner experience, but for a quick burger or sandwich, it's one of the better places in town, and definitely a few notches above standard pub fare.",2
This place is great for rolls Sashimi is just good. I always get the D's Guy and Justin Special. that is the way to go. The music is a little ghetto,2
There's been a menu revamp since it first opened and the food has markedly stepped up in quality,2
"Pho soup is not that tasty compare to the one i always go! The service is not that bad! The price is too much for the taste! nA few cup of beef pride rice is way too expensive for 9.00 wow! Would not go back there! I spend about 60 dollars for 2 large soup thats almost taste like water and salt,1 beefpriderice,2 charlbroild fork that really tin and tiny! 1 can of coke that was accidentally spilled and was not replaced!",1
"I admit I was a bit hesitant to go here because of the outside facade. With the words ""24 hours "" and ""gaming "" and location in a strip mall, I questioned the quality of the food. My friend took me here because she raved about the sushi and customer service. The sushi was excellent fresh and generous portions. I particularly liked the sake sea bass and chicken mu shu. They offer a diverse menu of Asian cuisine by the way. Since it's 24 hours, it's great for anyone who may be craving good food during the wee hours of the morning. Yep, one should not judge a book or restaurant by it's cover.",2
"I moved here from California and apparently the service here is just as good! I looooove in n out. I never eat fast food, except in n out, and I don't even consider it that because it's always freshly made. I always get a number 2 with animal fries. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating, and the food is always hot fresh! Best burger you'll ever have! ",2
"Excellent! I was a bit apprehensive eating here because it is a celebrity chef restaurant and a chain, but being a fan of Bobby Flay and having heard good things I had to try it. I was very pleasantly surprised, the staff were great, very knowledgeable and very welcoming. n nThe food was delicious, we had the Ahi Tuna and the green pepper cioppino as well as the brussels sprouts as a side dish. Being a big lover of good cioppino the green pepper base really intrigued me, venturing out of the traditional tomato base, and it was brilliant! I do not know how to describe it without not doing it justice so I will just say go eat it, it is the best cioppino I have ever had, the fish, scallops, and lobster that were in it were cooked perfectly and the green pepper broth was so delicious, so so delicious! Aside from the cioppino the Tuna was also very good, and the brussels sprouts were cooked with pomegrante seeds which was seriously tasty. n nAll in all, when in vegas there are a ton of options to eat at, but you should eat here!",2
Loved all the sushi and plates we ordered. Excellent service and a nice place to eat. Maybe a bit pricey but in a special occasion its worth it. I don't recall anything I didn't like so if you like sushi in general you can try anything and will be really good. The only thing I remember not liking as much was the spring rolls with strawberries for dessert. All other desserts were really good.,2
"So after tasting this place at the Yelp Science Center party I KNEW I had to go check this place out! I had never even heard of a Pupusas until that fateful Yelp night. n nThe hubs and I rolled in about 7 30ish. We were the only ones in the place aside from the waiter and the cook. We took a seat and the waiter came on over with menus in hand. He was really helpful, I told him I didn't know what I had at the yelp party but I wanted it again. I had the shredded beef, bean and cheese pupusas. So tasty. n nThe hubs and I also split an order of the potato and cheese puff things. It was like a deep fried mashed potato missile! So crunchy on the out side yet so fluffy on the inside. n nHubs got 3 pupusas, two shrimp and a steak. I sampled the steak and it was pretty bomb! He went nuts over the shrimp, but I skipped trying it out, wasn't in the shrimp frame of mind. The one thing I wasn't a total fan of was the coleslaw, it has a very vinegary, dill, I don't know what kind of taste. I am VERY finicky with my coleslaw though, hubs said he liked it. n nThe restaurant itself is nothing to write home about. Its olllllld. The tables and chairs are from the late 80's and worn. There was some rad gangsta rap playing over the speakers and Bones reruns on the tv, but when I noticed the time and asked if they could switch the tv to american idol yes I am a nerd He gladly did so and turned down the rap. Pretty rad. n nSo for an iced tea, a total of four pupusas and some tasty deep fried potato puff guys, the bill was only 13.99 with the coupon they gave out at the yelp event . We left very full.",2
"This place has the look and pricing of a nice restaurant befitting of the Bellagio hotel but the food was just okay and the service was terrible no better than a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. It was a long wait before our waitress decided to grace us with her presence. She had no personality and didn't even say the minimal ""Hi, can I take your order "" her mere presence at our table was her indication to us that she was ready to take our order. Food was slow to come out and one server practically threw a dish on to our table. I expect this kind of service from a hole in the wall restaurant in exchange for cheap prices but this restaurant charges quite a premium for what they serve.",1
"I came here after work today to do carry out. I only come here for one item and that's the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls. They are addicting and filling even though it only comes with three rolls. These have chicken,lettuce, fresh mint, carrots, peanuts ,rice noodles, with a taste of lime vinaigrette rolled in a rice wrapper. It comes with sweet chili sauce and Thai peanut sauce on the side. My personal favorite is the peanut sauce. nI enjoy doing carry out because it's ready for me to pick up right after work. When I call in my order it's quick and fast because by my phone number they can tell what I ordered last time. I was recently made aware that they also have a frequent diner card there too. I just started using it today so I don't know their point system. If it means every once in a while I can get these rolls for free then I'm in!",2
"I cannot say enough about this wonderful establishment. The food is without a doubt the best pub fare I've ever sampled the beer list is a dream come true. I love that there is always a cask of ""real ale "" available and a cicerone to help find a perfect pairing of food brew. The food, beverages service are all exemplary. nThe poutine with duck confit will force me to come back very soon.",2
"This place has taken a turn for the worse. Tables falling apart, booths ripped up, paint peeling from the sides of tables, tape all over wow. Food has gotten worse, too. Unfortunately, I can't recommend BVD anymore. Hope they can fix it.",1
"Save yourself from disappointment by walking in with low expectations. If you're after a celebrity chef restaurant here in Las Vegas, hit Mesa or Scarpetta instead.",1
"This place was amazing. It was a bit chilly out so we waited for an indoor table, about 15 mins. My only complaint would be that the music was a bit too loud to hear someone not talking over it. The duck burger was amazing. The drinks are too. Get the Old Fashioned.",2
"If you can help it, don't use them. nService is horrible, the product is the same. nAnd they are expensive.",1
"This is the best Mexican market I've been to in Arizona. It's enormous.like a Costco decorated with colorful hand painted wooden signs everywhere you turn. Unfortunately, like Costco, it can also be packed. Granted, this location is new and attracting a crowd with some of its specials, but I have a feeling that the number of customers won't wane too much any time soon. Not only are the prices super competetive for any and every Mexican food product you could desire, there's a fabulous fresh foods section. This includes a juice stand, a yogurt stand, a salsa bar, a carnitas pollo rostizado costillas section, a guisados and platos combinatos line, tacos and of course freshly made warm tortillas. Plus outdoor grilling. Pretty much like Mexico, except cleaner and they accept credit cards for anything. It's heavenly.",2
"I came here as part of a food tour we took during our stay in Scottsdale. We tried their pulled pork tacos and homemade chips and salsa, everything was DELICIOUS! Our guide also told us about happy hour taco night I can't remember when it is but next time we are in Scottsdale, we will for sure have ourselves more of their amazing tacos!",2
"Cheap, made to order burgers featuring fresh ingredients? Yes please! Very busy during the school year, so visit accordingly.",2
"I recently spent three nights at the Meridian with two friends. Someday, it will be a fantastic place to stay, but as of 11 07, they are NOT ready for guests. n nThe suites are spacious and private and the beds are very comfortable. The grounds are gorgeous, though a bit confusing figuring out how to get around. It is gated and while that provides security, it is necessary to always have the key or code to get in and out of the various gates. There is a lot of construction going on, so with all the workers it doesn't seem very private outside. The walk to the strip is a good 15 minutes of a brisk stride no big deal for us, but for older people or those with health issues or if it's very hot or rainy , it could be too much. Also, I wouldn't walk it alone at night. n nWe had the 2 bedroom suite but needed to move to another suite for the following reasons 2 out of 3 tvs didn't work the phones rang numerous times in both suites with people asking for unknown parties phones don't go through the registration desk there were no brochures books to help us with understanding the hotel, LasVegas or even a phone number to the front desk several lamps didn't have light bulbs housekeeping never brought us new ones the kitchen had an old half full beer bottle on one of their shelves the bathroom shower head kept falling so we had to hold it up with one hand the whole time the interior bedroom had a window to the lighted halllway outside so we had to put a blanket over the window to block the light that same room is VERY noisy in the morning as the housekeeping carts roll over the tile and grooves, making sleep impossible at 8am in the morning. We moved to another suite and while it was a bit quieter and certainly beautiful , we found a large cockroach, more calls on the phone for other people and it took over two hours for housekeeping to bring us a coffeepot that worked. n nAgain, I think this place has the potential to being a class act, but it has growing pains and a lack of handling small details like managing the phone system and getting us a working coffeepot sooner than 2 hours which means customer service has its own growing pains.",1
"Hit and miss, these days. 3 stars on the food these days, every other category they do great. n nThey used to be a solid 5 star Thai source back when they opened, but now about half the food is really really good and the other half is not really good. Their Pad Thai used to be the best ever by a fair bit, now it is just sweet and doesn't even have peanuts on it last couple of trips at least . The barbecue was OK, but the green chile dipping sauce it came with was exceptional. n nStill AWESOME Beef Panang, Pad Kee Mau spicy coconut milk chicken soup . All their curries have been awesome to my memory. I used to take joy in trying new things here, now I am more cautious. n nI hear there is a Scottsdale location now, but I think I will stick with the original.",2
Very clean and the staff is always willing to help. Open 24 7,2
"Ok. I don't really understand all the crappy ratings. I came here on a Sunday to watch football, drink beer, eat some damn wings, and forget I have to work tomorrow. Mission accomplished. Here's my thoughts. n n1. Food I got the wings with a side of onion rings. The bartender let me split the flavors, so I got honey hot and some chili flavor.breaded, not naked. They were solid. Not the best wings in the area I still say Sidelines has the best , but they were pretty solid, and large. Good helping of wings. Onion rings were as you'd expect. Amazing, cuz they're f ing onion rings. n n2. Beer I think I drank 6 22 oz Budweisers. Nuff said. Wish I could have stayed longer and drank more. n n3. Service I sat at the bar outside. Brittany sp? was the bartender. Cute gal. She's super friendly. Made a point to introduce herself and remember my name. Solid game there. Is she single? If the owner checks these, please see if she's looking. Anyway, please please please tell her to smile more. She seems rushed and frustrated. It looks like she needs assistance behind the bar, since that's where everyone sits. I appreciate her hustle. But the service was slow as previous reviews have mentioned . Not the bartender's fault. Oh, and there's a waitress walking around, in her late 40s I think, dressed like a 22 year old. Put em away hun. Maybe 20 years ago. But my service was good. I never felt neglected. n n4. Prices Previous reviews indicate this place is expensive. Huh? My big beers were 3, and my huge plate of wings was 9. How is that pricey? I spent less today than I thought I would when I went out to find somewhere to drink and eat. My bill was on par with other places in the area. n n5. Atmosphere So here's where my down vote comes in. Who is in charge of the tv's? It feels like the organization of the football games on the tv's was all over the place. Two consecutive screens had the same game. The big projector had the Cardinals, but the sound was like 3 seconds off, and during the overtime game between NO and SF, the game was changed to some other retarded blowout. I don't get it. But, tv's are big and plentiful. Some of the tv's on the patio were off. I didn't get that. The place was clean, menu was simple and solid, nothing else to complain about. n n There was a group sitting behind me who brought their Rottweiler. Obnoxious a holes. I hope you read this review. You're marginally below ISIS in ranking of who do I want to least meet in my life. Keep your junkyard dog at home. The rest of us go to a bar to enjoy it, not listen to your rescue story. n n4 Stars. Brittanny FTW n n After proofreading my review, I noticed a glaring omission. There isn't a sign on the men's room door. I thankfully found the right door, praying to God I didn't walk into the wrong restroom. n nI'll be back. Brittany, you better be smiling next time.",2
Service was great.mochiko chicken and garlic chicken is really good.20 all u can eat lunch can't go wrong.,2
"I'm not gonna lie, the two sushi rolls I ordered for takeout were delicious. They were ""americanized sushi "", but the fish was fresh and quality was apparent. n nBut the staff was rude to me from the start. As soon as I mentioned I had a check in offer for free edamame, I was made to feel l like a crazy coupon clipping cat lady. There was a 10 minute hold while the hostess ""checked "" if the check in offer was valid. When I arrived I was told to stand there because I had to speak with a manager about the check in offer I was using. All in all, the free edamame was not worth the 20 minute hassle.",1
"I did not stay at the hotel, but we celebrated a birthday at the lounge on top of the W, hotel. This was by far the best lounge I have ever been too. It feels like the W is sitting on top of all Scottsdale, it has a great view and the service is top notch. n nThey have different sections of the lounge, one section has sand and nice lounge chairs that make you feel like your in Hawaii. We ordered food, and I recommend the Kobe Beef Sliders, I am not sure if I was just hungry or this was the best beef id ever had! The drinks were great too, a little on the pricey side, but what do you expect from the W. n nOverall this is a great spot. Whenever I am in the Scottsdale area I will definitely be visiting this place.",2
"Le Cupcake Shoppe specializes in selling delectable, mini cupcakes 1 each or 10 per dozen .The owner, Alexandra, and her mother are fantastic and are truly vested in their small business.

"I love sweets. If I could live off sweets and not gain 300lbs, I would. Chocolate, ice cream, cake, ect, give it to me! SO obviously when I drove by this place in my heart I knew it would be amazing. I didn't catch the name so I thankfully was able to look it up on Google maps and the next day I made my way there! n nI was not disappointed at all! I got the toasted coconut it had a better name but I cannot think of it right now and plain ole chocolate. Omg was this good! I usually always go for the chocolate and that's it, as I am 100 chocolate lover, but I couldn't pass up the coocnut! It was simply amazing! This place is sadly pretty far from my house, but I will for sure be making the trip down there in the future to fulfill my ice cream needs. n nNow I know to always trust my gut for when a place looks good on the outside, most likely it will be amazing!",2
Chicken enchiladas were terrible could tell they were cooked and left to reheat under a heat lamp. It was boiled chicken with no flavor wrapped in soggy tortillas with a pretty standard cheese sauce. The rice tasted like it was microwaved. The waiter kept leaning over me instead of walking to the other side of the table. He didn't replace the silverware from dinner when we ordered dessert. Disappointing food and service.,1
"If you shop here make sure you know exactly what you're buying, the sales reps will lie to your face without a second thought just to sell a couple things. With all the gun stores in Arizona the last one I would pick again is one with a widespread and well earned ""used car salesmen "" reputation. Shop elsewhere.",1
"My 3rd stay at the Clarendon was over 4th of July weekend, I really like this place. I have no need for large resorts with fancy spas, I never use the spas. The Clarendon provides the great rooms and beds along with a cool pool without the extras I have no need for. Plus in the summer, they have super deals. I like the decor in the rooms, colorful and modern, and the beds and linens are absolutely fantastic. We had a king suite, with a seperate sitting area and huge flat screen tv in the bedroom. This is my favorite place to stay in Phoenix, a better alternative to the standard chains.",2
"Loved Happy Hour! Great Food, Great Beer it was a little loud and I found myself screaming a few times, but the yummy happy hour food and beer made up for the sore throat will def, go back with friends and family.",2
"had a crappy day wanted a couple of drinks went to Applebees with a couple of friends. The food is the food. It is a chain restaurant, but the waiter was wonderful. I was drinking my jack and diets and he made sure I didn't run out. We were kidding around about them having a 3 for 30 there were three of us and so he sat down and said now we could do 2 . 2 for 20, got some of the other staff involved. It was fun and definitely lifted my mood. I totally recommend this place if you are just looking for a local place to hang that is consistent with good wait staff.",2
"I'm usually leery of buffets, but having lived in Vegas for nearly 9 years, I've tried quite a few of them. The Rio's Carnival World buffet does a very good job all around. n nIt's huge with food from different parts of the world including Asian with a Mongolian barbecue station , the U.S., with heavy focus on down home Southern goodness. Don't miss the mashed red potatoes I had three helpings! Italian, Mexican as well as breads, salads, pizza, seafood snow crab, cold shrimp, fried shrimp, fried fish and baked fish with drawn butter and cocktail sauce, and a carving station with pork roast, roast beef, prime rib, turkey and ham. I camped out on the prime rib it is deliciously seasoned and they have little cups for au jus. n nEnough about the food. Let's get to the real point dessert. These people know their way around sweets! They have at least 10 varieties of gelato in every flavor imaginable, apple and raisin bread pudding with vanilla sauce I'm a bread pudding lover, and as anyone who eats it knows, it's not always made well the Rio has it on point , little cakes, tiny pies, eclairs, cheesecake in a chocolate shell, custards and cookies. even sugar free items. n nIf you heed nothing else I write, you must believe me on this get a cup of their very good coffee, a plate of bread pudding and some of their bananas foster fresh bananas in a warm bath of butter, sugar, spices and rum and forget everything else you ate. Take a forkful of the bread pudding with a piece of banana and make sure you put as much of the rum sauce as will stay on the bite, close your eyes, thank your maker for taste buds and enjoy. n nYou're welcome ",2

"Not a fan. The waiter raved about their seafood how it arrives fresh daily and is great. Hence, we ordered some fish. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and just by the look of it, we already knew it was a disaster. n nThe calamari looked like scrawny chicken strips and tasted like a flavorless, rubbery, unknown protein dipped in batter. n nI ordered the pungent salmon that the waiter recommended it was absolutely disappointing, to say the least. It was exactly that. Pungent. Extremely fishy in taste and smell, and under seasoned, much like the fish tacos that my friend ordered. n nTheir Greek steak salad looked okay good, but I wouldn't go back for it. Much better places around here to dine in.",1
It was great! Nice people and they did my car very nice! I am for sure going here for now on!,2
"Very smooth race! A nice out and back course for the HM well, basically out and back . n nStarted at Mandalay Bay in waves, separated by about a minute. Lots of news coverage. Turnaround was roughly at Fremont Street. Roads were wide, lots of room to move, not too crowded as opposed to Bloomsday in Spokane where people are elbow to elbow! . Water Gu Cytomax regularly approx every 2 miles . n nThe finish line held many options for recovery. Pictures with showgirls necessary as far as I could tell , space blanket foil insulators, bananas, pretzels, water, cytomax, gogurt, bagels, beer MGD64 THOUGH? , Marathon bars. Gear check was smooth and easy. n nA very nice race!",2
"Underwhelmed. Perhaps it's my fault for having high expectations based on others' reviews and based on the veg friendly menu. Plus I had my heart set on adding another joint to my ""dog friendly "" collection of hang outs. But I left wishing for better food, better drinks and a smaller bill. n nThe hummus was dry and a bit chalky. The pita was stale. The white balsamic ""vinaigrette "" was viscous and had some seriously strong onion business going on. The fish and fries were decent my dining companion admitted they were very well prepared albeit with maybe a pat or 2 of too much butter. The ""seasoned vegetables "" as listed on the menu was misleading I took that to mean a plural variety of vegetables. But it meant a whole head of broccoli. Mmk. The cucumber martini was gross, that's as objective as I can put it. Sour? In a cucumber martini? I thought that might be a typo for Sake. But it turned out to be a good way to ruin 3 oz of vodka and a plump refreshing slice of cucumber. n nThe service was ok, the atmosphere was alright. But I didn't feel the food or drink were priced appropriately for the quality. The menu looks so lovely with all it's meatless fare and fresh sounding ingredients, but I felt a kind of emptiness after dining here. One that no french fry alone can fill. n nWould I return? If it were not my decision, I would return to meet friends here or attend an event. And I will order something else on the menu with full hopes of a new and better impression. But the impression I got from this meal was ""recession, I guess they must be feeling it in the kitchen too. """,1
"ate at the location in the miracle mile shops. my friend and i were hammered, and i saw their cheeseburger challenge and had to do it. food overall there was pretty good though, so i wouldn't mind coming back even if i don't do the challenge. n nmy burger nfor the challenge they have a special burger that is supposedly like 3 pounds as it is a double cheeseburger with jalapenos, mushrooms, bacon, kalua pork, and the regular burger fixings, all on a huge bed of chili fries. the waitress was trash talking the whole time saying i couldn't do it, but it was that playing around trash talking which made it a fun experience. i ended up finishing it all but it was really good. n noverall, i would recommend the place as everyone else highly enjoyed their food also",2
"I think I've eaten about half the lunch menu here and have yet to be disappointed. Friendly staff, great food. I would definitely recommend the red curry or pad prik king.or the spicy noodle.",2
"This is our second visit to Eggstasy and it's just getting better. Peter Varros, the owner, is always out and about, checking on customers and spreading serious joy. He is great and obviously knows what he's doing. n nHad the panini today.and the wheat pancakes.and corned beef hash with hash browns.and a fruit crepe.geez. All so very fresh and good. I'm stuffed. The portions are really huge and probably should be cut down by a third. n nHad the orange juice today and it was truly fresh squeezed and almost mango colored. They must be using the good Valencia oranges. Yum. Hard to find fresh squeezed anything in the Valley. n nOur waitress, Tara, was professional, warm and attentive without being overly so. Nice staff. n nThis place is starting out very well. Lovely location, nice natural light from the windows we always get there early enough to get a window seat! , noisy, but in a happy way. n nHopefully, it will be here for a very long time. God knows, the Valley needs a decent breakfast place.this is our new choice. Next time, it's lunch!",2
"Had about 2 hours of fun at the phx MVD and thought i would reward myself for dealing with that, so I yelped what was near and guess what shows up! I had no idea they had more locations, i thought it was only the one from man v food. n nWalked in and first thing that happens is that im welcomed by the owner. I ask for a recommendation, and he recommends El Rey The King Its a big torta so I opted for the smaller Especial. the same sandwich except without the egg , chorizo, and sausage omlette! I also got a agua de pina fresh pineapple juice . legit! I would go back for that alone. the torta was big. maybe to big. but hey. man v food did go there for the challenge so expect it! n nThe torta was good, had different cuts of pork in it and i think a slice of breaded beef! The neighborhood could be considered not desirable, but get over it, the place is fine. i usually judge a place based on whether or not i would return. for the food, service, and atmosphere. n nThe answer is yes, i am going back to try some other stuff on their menu, the service was quick and the waitresses were nice, the food was good especially the juices, and the atmosphere was whatever. but yes i will return to get me some fuel soon!",2
"It may be fry bread for some of their offerings, but very light fry bread, not heavy or greasy. I got red Chile fry bread, wife got the Calabsitas soup, both were VERY good, full of flavor for the unique desert SW flavors and style of food. We also sampled their green chile pork and potato soup too and wow! that was good and warning for those who don't like spicy, this would be one to sample before getting a bowl. We will certainly be coming back to this great place with very friendly staff!",2
"Encore Bridal Boutique deserves four stars because of the potential that this little shop has. I met Gretchen, the owner, at a Bridal Expo that was held at the Santa Fe. I loved the dresses that were shown in the fashion show, so I decided to make an appointment. When I arrived at the shop and began looking at the dresses in the back, I felt pretty uncertain. The dresses that are available are purchased ""as is "" which means that I had to find a dress in my size or two sizes up so it could be fitted. I was not a fan of seeing the gowns on the racks some were uncovered and the flaws were really noticeable on a few gowns. My only suggestion would be to put each gown in a clear bag to show that they are all cared for even if they are previously used sample gowns. Gretchen had pulled some gowns already that she thought I might like, which was very nice of her. but I am pretty picky and only tried on two gowns which I did not fall in love with and we all know that this is a must for wedding gowns . n nI am sure that brides who are looking for a great deal will be able to find something to suit their tastes. I even spotted a Pnina Tornai and a Maggie Sotterro in the back! The bride before me ended up purchasing her gown there and seemed very happy! The customer service here is great, as Gretchen is extremely friendly. I hope that this business continues to grown and thrive.",2
"Brenda's daughter took us here for breakfast one Saturday morning instead of going to the local Denny's or IHOP. She insisted that it had some good food and the overall reviews said it was pretty good. When we got there, there were quite a few people ahead of us so hopefully that spoke to the quality of the food unfortunately it didn't. After a long wait in line we finally were seated and greeted by a waitress who didn't seem like she really wanted to be there either she probably already tasted the food . n nWe ordered our coffee and juice and stared at the menu. Brenda and I both have an adventurous palate and are willing to try anything at least once. However, there is a difference between adventurous and just plain crazy. When you read the menu, nothing jumps out and says ""Hey! Pick me! I'm really tasty. "" Quite the opposite the food and flavor combinations of everything except the pancakes don't even begin to sound like they'll work together. However, to be polite, we placed our orders and waited for the food. I had the only thing that sounded somewhat normal to me the corned beef has with red onions and Swiss cheese. By the way, they have a no substitutions policy and they do enforce it. n nThe service here isn't any better than the food. Wait staff is slow and you may or may not have everyone's meal served at the same time.As we waited for the food to arrive, we saw that the portions they brought out were huge even bigger than what we get at Black Bear. Unsurprisingly, with the amount of people here, the wait for the food was about 40 minutes, which is a bit long for breakfast. Apparently because the food is all ""homemade "", it prevents the kitchen staff from having any type of timing system to ensure everyone at the table is served at the same time. When my food was placed in front of me, I just kind of stared at it. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered corned beef hash. Instead of a neat presentation, I faced a huge pile of potatoes and the hash topped with a slice of cheese and two overcooked eggs. Sticking out of the top of this monstrosity was a rosemary tree. Normally, I would expect something like this to have the hash grilled and then have the cheese placed on top and remixed once it the cheese melted before putting it on the plate. I also expected the ""crispy "" potatoes to be on the side. Since they were thrown in with the hash, they were soggy from all the grease. n nThe food itself lacked any real flavor and no amount of salt and pepper really did anything to improve it. Sure, the portions were huge, but that just meant more wasted food at the end of the meal. Quality is a bit more important that quantity. n nTheir motto is ""Twisted Farm Food. "" I'm not sure what farms they're visiting, but it doesn't conjure up any memories of food I ate growing up in Pennsylvania Dutch country. Head on over to IHOP, Denny's or Black Bear if you want a better meal at a cheaper price.",1
"well, what i can tell you about this location. one word dishonest! nthis location had many many issues, the service is terrible, the store manager David looks nice, but operate like he is in the open market. ntheir staff is OK and less, service can be better. nkudos to Abby who make the place better. nOK, the biggest draw for any supermarket is the produce, here they run like an idiots! neach produce sitting well over a week in the back employee telling me this and more! when it comes out to the shelf, in a day max. two its bad as bad can be. nthey have so many returns of produce it isn't funny anymore. nthey have bad apples, mango slice, watermelon and oranges that just sit there and rot and you know when one is bad in a bag then all the bag is bad as well. nif you buy keep the receipt since you will need it to return it back! nmilk and dairy products are changing price weekly, chocolate milk went from 2.90 to all the way to 3.33 in less than 2 months, that apply to other products as well! nto me its very simple, the store isn't profitable, so therefore David the store manager increasing the pricing and trying to sell everything that isn't good. nthat not why i bought membership, that one will cheat and be dishonest and operates location like he is in the open market. nget your act together there and start treating people nicer and bring better quality products and produce!",1
"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL n nI would never come here again. nThe ""grilled "" shrimp are steamed and not really grilled and by the time they bring the shrimp at your table they are cold. nThe meat is awful! They bring this uneatable meat every half and hour and they are not even busy. nIn the mean time.till you wait for your uneatable shrimp or meat you can enjoy the salad bar .maybe you want to try their 'delicious' mashed potatoes WITH SKIN and awful taste. n nI do NOT recommend this place at all. n nI would give them MINUS 5 STARS iF possible.",1
"If you're too full for a buffet, Earl's is perfect. If you're in the mood to grab a little snack while walking the strip, Earl's is perfect. If you're on the way to grab a Fat Tuesday and you want a snack to go with it, Earl's is perfect. After the club, when you're hella hungry and you need something to sober your drunk ass up , Earl's is perfect. n nI highly recommend the Caprese sandwich.All my friends got different sandwiches too and we were all pretty satisfied with what we got. You're already spending hella money in Vegas either on gambling, hotel, clubs, dranks, whatevz. Earl's is cheap and hella good !",2
"I tried to go there tonight and right when we parked and got out of the car, their flashing open sign goes out. We got there at 8pm as their website and store hours listed on their front door advertises that they close at 10pm! Maybe it's time they updated their website and sign on the front door. I would have liked to have eaten there tonight as we were in the area but I won't be coming back since they don't like to stay open till the time they advertise.",1
"Living on the ""other side of the mountain "" depended on Yelpers and other reviews to find a casual place to go to watch the game and get a bite to eat near Glendale. FuNuGyz did not disappoint! Lots of TV screens, great wings which they even grilled for me! and the beer was ice cold! Poker games going on in the back, Trivia and sports going on the TV's and Karoake starting right after end of game! Appreciated they held Karoake til the game over ended late.which some places refuse to do and even servers who were not assigned to us stopped by to see if we needed anything! YEA! Bathrooms large and clean, atmosphere casual and friendly and able to see multiple TV's from every angle! Thanks yelpers for the reviews.you never let me down! Will DEFINATELY go back . when I am on that side of town! ",2
"I moved to this facility because the Cheyenne Rainbow club closed. So far it's been ok but nothing to get excited about. More later as my experience with the staff and facility develops. n nREVIEW UPDATE It only took a couple of months to experience negativity. Managers are unresponsive to messages left with staff. Personal training experience less than desirable. Although you will see attempts by the club manager to be apologetic in their posts to Yelp, there's no action behind their words.",1
"EAT . ATE . Enjoyed it! n nCorned Beef Hash 14 Chunks of corned beef with savory potatoes, 2 poached eggs and 4 pieces of sourdough toasted to perfection. Realy enjoyed the toast here. The portion size was fair but a little on the pricier side for a brunch item. n nEggs Benedict 13 Wasn't my favorite item breadding on bottom was sweet and turkey bacon was used instead of regular. Poo. I love turkey bacon but a girl's trying to get some delicious bad food in me while in Vegas! However, the caramelized onions and potatoes were on point. n nFree Range Chicken Sandwich 12 This dish sounds average and something you can get anywhere but my oh my. The chicken wasn't dry. The pesto, mozzarella cheese and pesto blend was beyond perfect. I tried savoring every last bite of it! YUM. I tend to lean more on brunch items during brunch hours but this dish is one to get! n nAll dishes were decently sized. Hipster type of atmosphere. Location is off. it's underneath an apartment studio complex! Lots of metered street parking for 1 hour. Something to try while out in Vegas!",2
"One star only because the food was ok. Other than that everything pretty much sucked! nthe iced tea was old, and when I told the waitress about it she just said Oh, as if I was lying about it. the tri tip was 11 and came with nothing else but a bun and meat that's it n n what a sham I can't believe this place even got close to 4 stars. benihanas has a 3 star rating. what the heck is going on here people. please stop giving people high ratings that do not deserve it. n n I went out of my way to check this place out because of the high ratings on Yelp. not worth it, not at all. The place was a dump, they only have one toilet in the whole restaurant, that both men, and women have to share. it was so awkward. not to mention the waitresses are dressed as if they're getting ready to Jazzercise. what a joke! save yourself some time, and go somewhere else. "" tacos and more "" is 10 times better than this place. also "" Teakwoods "" is great there's so many better options here in Maricopa other than this place. the food was ok, I guess, but way overpriced. not worth it! n nI will not be back to this place",1
"At first look this is a great company. We recently purchased a house from smokers so we had to have the ENTIRE interior of a 2700 sq. ft. house repainted closets, ceilings, EVERYTHING . David came out to give a quote and was very nice and professional. Explained everything to us. Stated they were going to roll the walls instead of spray so that in the future if we have to touch them up you can't see the brushstrokes! We had never considered this and were impressed that the information was offered and explained as we had assumed spraying which would be MUCH faster and easier of a project of this size. Day 1 the 2 painters clogged and flooded the hall bathroom toilet so there was sewer water UNDER the plastic taped to protect the floor from paint. No apologies from either of them. Fast forward a week when the painting is done. Walls were painted incorrect colors, the rope lighting on a ledge near the ceiling was not put back, light fixtures were still taped over, tape was still on the edge of carpet and ceilings and windows. When we called the head painter Richard, he came back corrected the paint colors and rope lighting without grumble but was supposed to remove all the tape and uncover fixtures but didn't. We STILL were unable to get in touch with David. They also sprayed the walls and when contacted we David he never got back to us and even Richard said he couldn't get a hold of him. Not only did they spray but when we went to get the leftover paint cans to touch up some dings from moving in and installing granite they were full of WATER that they used to clean out the sprayer. So in essence we have NO extra paint in ANY of the 4 colors we used. They were also supposed to paint the ceiling in a flat paint so that there would be no glare and visible spray lines.guess what!? Its NOT flat paint and glares and spray lines are VERY visible.There are many paint smudges on windows that we had to clean off and were hanging a clock the other day and saw a dirty hand print from one of them where they must have braced themselves on the wall when climbing a ladder. 2 weeks later we are still trying to get in touch with them and just opened another can of supposedly ""extra "" paint and found it full of trash. NASTY. I would NEVER recommend them to ANYONE and we should have gone with another company. Saving 500 has NOT been worth the headache to not even get a call back from David. Richard the head painter did always followed up with us and respond to calls but the details of trash disposal and tape removal were seriously lacking.",1
"Had dinner here Sat night with husband. Atmosphere is cool and rooftop is nice. Food is mediocre at best. We both had the same type of burrito, but they were very different. One had a lot of sauce inside and no pico, the other barely any sauce and lots of pico. Chips and salsa were good. Service was horrible. The two hostesses are more interested in talking with each other than seating guests. They kept looking at us, but kept talking. We finally asked to seat ourselves, then they seated us. Our waiter was HORRIBLE! He was rude. He kept asking us if we wanted seperate a checks. We were seated at a four top, but sat beside each other. We were both wearing our wedding rings and my 5carat diamond.we are obviously married. My husband said no, but the waiter wouldn't let it go. He kept it up. Then before we left he snidely said ""sorry to make this uncomfortable "". Save yourself the trouble.drive another mile and go to Mad Mex.always great food!",1
"A great place to check out if you happen to be simultaneously craving Korean food and Mexican food. It's a small restaurant with decent fusion menu items. Came here the other night about 30 minutes until closing so I was a bit nervous about how we'd be treated and the quality of the food. Once we arrived, however, we were welcomed with all smiles and my worries were gone. The service was awesome. Our orders were taken and brought out in promptly fashion. n nWe ordered two plates of Kimchi Fried Rice spam and beef bulgogi and being a such a sucker for kimchi anything, I loved both. I prefer a little more of a spice factor, but it was still delicious. I also had the Fushion Tacos one beef bulgogi and one pork belly, which were also quite tasty. The meats were well seasoned not too sweet or salty and cooked to perfection. They were also very generous in filling the tacos. Whoop! Regardless of being close to closing time, all of our dishes were made fresh, which definitely made our experience with the food so enjoyable. I'd recommend any of their fusion items and most definitely the kimchi fried rice! Yumm. n nIf you're in the area and looking for tasty Korean Mexican fusion with good service, check this place out!",2
"Ate dinner there tonight and was very disappointed. It was very loud in the restaurant side of the place. T.Vs blaring with the sound on multiple different stations. n nWe ordered 2 different pizzas and when ordering I specifically asked the waitress if the mushroom were fresh or canned. She assured me they were fresh. Being they had stuffed portobello mushrooms on the menu, I thought they must be fresh. n nOur pizzas came out with slimy canned mushrooms. The dough was good. Nice and thick but the canned flavor ruined the whole quality of the pie. n nWe also waited 15 minutes after we were all finished with the meal for the waitress to come and ask how the meal was and get the check. She, nor the manager offered to take off any portion of the bill. nOver priced. Poor service. We will not be back.",1
"Dissappointing recent stay at Rio. Room was very nice but the maid knocking on the door at 8 30am is not cool especially in Vegas. Valet parking is a joke, took over 45 min a few times. Stores within the casino are very expensive. It is so far off the strip it is very inconvenient. The pool is very nice",1
I came in half an hour before they closed. The first thing the hostess says to me is they close in 30 rather than greeting us. Within two minutes of sitting down the waitress in the next section over is talking horribly about the table across from us with one of the managers. Hopefully they reevaluate their customer service skills and take their personal opinions in the kitchen next time instead of in front of their guests,1
"I don't like this chain of pubs, no matter where I go they seem to draw in the same type of crowd, and I have been to two in London and this one in Edinburgh. The pubs attract some pretty rough characters and the food that they offer is pretty cheap but also pretty bad. n nThe drink prices in the pub are actually pretty decent, and during the day, Edwards would be a good place to go to for a cheap pint or two and good for a catch up with friends. It's at night when the pub really does go into decline. n nOn a Friday night and Saturday, an area of the pub is turned into a dance floor and I do like to get loose on many a dance floor, but this is definitely not the place I would like to come to do break out my 'moves'. The floor is really sticky and the music is exactly what you would expect with chart music that is played too loud and perving men prying on daintily clad girls who look barely old enough to get in.",1
A good spot to have a greasy sub or pizza on the way home from a club bar at 3am. Fast service. Fast delivery if needed. I think they work 24 7 never seen them closed. n nA must have on your fridge.,2
"Service is bad slow. It took 10 minutes after sitting to get our drink orders taken only 5 tables with patrons . In fact, while we were waiting for breakfast one patron simply walked out after having ordered. I sat near the open kitchen area, I observed the staff. I saw the waitress move toast on the plate with her bare hands Wash Much? The hash browns were good my wife enjoyed her omelette. Big problem with the crepes. The crepes came from the kitchen burned on the edges. To his credit the cook noticed me flaking off the burnt edges and offered to make us another crepe to go. n nI would have given 2 stars because it has great potential but I had to take 1 back because of the service.",1
" ""The restaurant is four days old, and already has five 5 star ratings? Hmm, must check it out, "" I thought. n nNot so fast. n nWhat I suspect we have here is a lot of the owner's friends creating 5 star reviews to bring in curious Yelpers like me. You can tell because they're very ""promo ey "" and not so critical constructive . n nLet me give you the real deal, at this stage of the game. n n They're still 4 weeks away from a liquor license, thus no adult beverages to go with your tapas unless you BYOB, which everyone around us did apparently they got the memo . We could have used some of that awesome sangria from you know where. n Seemed like they're suffering the same ethos that plagues many mom pop restos lots of friends and family hovering and trafficking in and out of the kitchen, like its an extension of their home kitchen. Kids running through the restaurant. Felt like we were imposing on a personal space, yet, we're paying customers. Awkward. n Had to request silverware, after the first appy arrived. We sat there looking at it, at each other, at it, scoured the surrounding tables to see if we could borrow a set, but nope. Eventually we flagged the hostess co owner who then brought a set. Then another set arrived a few minutes later from the server. A bit uncoordinated. n The water is unfiltered, so it was truly tap water from the best the Vegas pipes have to offer. Tastes terrible. n Dining partner had the muddled mint and strawberry lemonade. Tall thin glasses at 3.50 a pop. WIth ice, of course, so you'll be going through your drinks pretty darn quickly. My brother went through about six refills which you do pay for . The hostess was nice and comped him one, I think because she knows that's a steep price for a tiny bit of actual beverage. n Cheese plate. 11 for tiny morsels of forgettable cheese! There was about 2 worth of cheese on the plate. Retitled, ""Rip me Off Please Cheese Plate. "" n Chicharrones. My brother is a chicharrones aficionado he guiltily admits . He took one bite and didn't touch the rest of it. His assessment, ""No. Just, no. "" n Bucket of tempura veggies edible along with the calamari. Hard to mess these up, but the calamari was comprised of super tiny rings. Lots of breading, not lots of calamari. Just kind of bummed at this point. n Lastly, bro ordered the cookie baked in a mini skillet for dessert. It arrives, with a plastic spoon. Odd. I watch him fight to get the tiny plastic spoon through rock hard ice cream while also trying not to let the spoon melt when touching the scalding hot cast iron skillet. Humorous to watch, yet, ridiculous. I flag down the server, ask for a metal spoon. He looks at my bro and asks, ""What's wrong with that spoon? "" ""I can't eat the ice cream with it its frozen solid. "" So what he brings us isa huge serving spoon meant for back of house. Jolly Green Gian spoon. nWhatever. My good nature is on its last tempura crumb at this point. n Asked for the check. Took 20 minutes. After check was paid with hostess , we had the receipt with a large stack of bills sitting on the table. Server flys by and scoops up the stack of bills 50 . ""Whoa, cowboy, that's our change. "" Again, uncoordinated I think they don't know who's doing what there, just yet. Server looked pretty young so maybe his first job while still in HS? Friend of the family, I'll bet. n nI keep saying to myself, ok, they're new. But lots of this stuff has nothing to do with new. Overall, not ready for prime time. And 50 later. feeling like I would have had a much better time, much better filling food at Firefly. Everything on Nosh Swig's menu can be had, in better quality, in their respective establishments around town. Leave the Korean to the Koreans, Japanese to the Japanese, White Trash to Simon, unless you can outshine them. Featuring variety is one thing, but variety without stellar quality not coming back.",1
"We had such a great dinner and Kory was our waitress. She rocked it for us. We had 6 or 7 of us. She worked with all of us and our separate checks. She offered us all of these yummy appetizers and even made us a special sort of thousand island dressing since they don't actually have t.i. dressing. Loved the desserts she recommended and the cocktails she recommended, too. We had a great family dinner and it was so amazing thanks to our server, Kory.",2

"I am a HUGE ramen fan.came to Phoenix for a quick 1 day visit and had to try the ramen in AZ. Following the reviews on yelp, i decided to give this place a try. Big mistake.

"Lolo's Chicken Waffles! Where do we start. n nWe had a large party 12 to be exact and everything turned out great. Seating policy is that everyone in the party must be present before the party is sat, so even if certain people come early to reserve seating, you won't be put on the list until everyone arrives. n nCannot remember our servers name but she was fabulous. Did a great job. Ordered 4 with two waffles and two chicken and it was awesome ! n nHowever, the best part of the meal was the sweet tea. If I could come here everyday for that sweet tea I would. This is not an exaggeration. That tea was brought here by the tea gods themselves n nHighly recommend!",2
Very bad customer services! They do not know how to do gel manicure! It looks so thick and all bubbles . Horrible customer services. I am very disappointed . Those people don't know how to run business . I will never recommend it .very low class.,1
Too bad it was not a good experience. I am a huge Giada fan so this new place was on the top of the list for Vegas. Probably the worst service ever. The orzo meatballs were fantastic but the other signature dishes were mediocre. No team work with service. No salt and pepper on table arrogant chef had to keep looking for service. Just really a major disappointment. Oh. It's expensive for mediocre food and TERRIBLE SERVICE,1
Davis was so helpful in my practice today. I usually do more stretching classes as I have wrist issues she Davis took time after the class to help me with proper form. n nClean nice studio. Look forward to taking more classes!,2
Are you people nuts? You don't go to the Imperial Palace to stay or gamble. You go there to see the CARS. That is the greatest car collection that is available to the public. n nI have stayed here once.and NEVER AGAIN. I could only see purple for a week. The room I had was in fair condition. Obviously these rooms were for those visiting vegas who never use the rooms anyways.and gamble the whole time there.,1
"Got groupon deal. First session was ok but I felt like since its a discount package its such a hassle for them to do it. I got a package to do my underarm so it takes less than 5 mins. Second session I was a couple of minutes late which was my fault. The tech took the next person after me and I was informed that she would be going to lunch right after and I would have to wait till she gets back. I asked if I could do it before she goes since its a quick service but the girl upfront gave an attitude and pretty much repeated eveything slowly like I'm not able to understand it. I'm sorry, I've been in costumer service since I could start working and there's a proper way to say no to a client or try to accommodate them. Telling me not to give HER attitude while she's rolling her eyes at me. Bottom line, not using groupon for any service packages because staff just seems pissed off with it. And for simplicity spa, they might need to train their staff with some better customer services skills. i never finished the 8 sessions i paid for and telling my friends not to go to this place.",1
"I sense I'm about to make myself very unpopular with my review of the Artisan Roast on Broughton Street. Firstly it's important to point out that I don't drink coffee. I am a tea drinker, so I was never going to worship this place as some kind of coffee mecca that everyone else seems to. n nI first thought upon walking in that they were in the middle of renovating. Nope this is how it always looks, like they've got the builders round. The chair I sat on was wobbly and had a hole in the material perhaps this coupled with the d u00e9cor is some kind of hipster theme I'm not cool enough to appreciate? Who knows? The place is really dark which makes it feel oppressive and unwelcoming inside. n nHowever the staff were really nice and laughed when I awkwardly asked for a pot of tea. The breakfast blend was loose leaf and was actually really good value as I left like I got about 5 cups out of it. Now we come to the massive issue I have with the place. After drinking about 5 or 6 cups of tea I discover that the only bathroom is out of order. Brilliant. Well that's one way to make sure you don't linger. It's also the kind of information that I'd appreciate when I sit down and order. n nI really don't understand what is so special about this place. Fair enough if it makes the best flat white in the city, but if you aren't a coffee drinker there really isn't much here for you. Personally I don't think I'll be back. There are nicer places to meet someone for a coffee than here.",1
This was a random stop since my friend I were looking for a place to hang out. Very relaxing enjoyable atmosphere. The teas were GREAT! Wish they had something like this in SD. Will definitely stop over again next time.,2
"My family and I went to this restaurant on Mother's Day so perhaps I am being biased as I know most restaurants are out of control on that particular date. n nThis was my experience We had a group of 9 and got seated right away. That was initially impressive! Our waiter was a man named Lorenzo. We ordered drinks, got our chips and salsa bean dip rather quickly. We ordered our food and from then on it was a 45 minute wait to receive the food. I think I would have been okay with waiting on the food if I didn't notice that all other families that arrived after mine were brought their food right away. Small or larger groups everyone else's waiters were ON IT however, ours was not. I finally could not stand it any longer and approached him to ask if he could bring our food as each plate was ready, versus waiting on all of them to be ready entirely. He seemed annoyed at my comment, but noticing how slow he was moving kept irritating me. n nOnce the food arrived, I was starved and shoved everything down. I had a combination plate with Huevos Rancheros. The hand made tortillas that came with the meal were a nice surprise. However, the rice was bland. My huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor. I asked around the table, and the variety on our table had burritos and fish combo plates, yet they all agreed that each item was rather bland. n nThe alcoholic drink selection although not that large, was very good. I ordered something called ""Que Viva la Borrachera "" and I have to say that probably saved this entire rating. They packed on the alcohol! n nI would consider this place for appetizers and drinks with a friend, but not for a meal.",1
Super late night grub! Can't go wrong with Boston pizza! It's cheesy and full of flavor! We also ordered a 40 PC chicken wings w ranch. Now that ranch is no joke! It's nice and thick but creamy tasty. Wings weren't that great. It seems that the later time you come they side foods are old and dry. Except pizza Don't know if anyone can relate? Last time my chicken wings were old like if they have been sitting under a heat lamp or something. I'm giving it 4 starts because of the disappointing wings,2

"One of the rare times Yelp reviews completely mislead us! Key reasons for this EPIC FAIL for Valentine's Dinner. 1. Food was not worth the price. 2. Server failed to disclose the very expensive price of a bottle of wine that was not listed on the menu 3. Service was slow 4. Ambiance was unusual n nMy husband and I went to Quiessence for Valentine's on Thursday the 13th and ordered the prefix menu for 80 per person. I waited at the table by myself for the first hour because my husband was coming straight from the airport and his flight was unexpectedly delayed. I didn't mind this at all especially because I could catch up on some emails while enjoying some much needed wine and quiet time 3 babies at home don't get out much . I asked the server a few questions about what she recommended for sweet wines and she suggested a bottle that was normally a special and not listed on the menu. I liked it a lot and the manager approved the sale however she did not tell me the price. I didn't ask because of all the sweet wines we were considering the most expensive one was about 48 bottle. I wouldn't assume that the bottle I got would be much more and if so, the server would tell me. Um no! It was 77! I was so frustrated and over this place when I got the bill, I just paid it and left as soon as I could. n nRegarding the food it was a 4 course meal, all of which was mediocre. The appetizer of prosciutto and brie was good but small and must of had a food cost of cents! The soup and salad was the same level of quality squash soup and kale salad . Nothing special. The pork shank entree was the best part of the meal but not worth 80 to have 1 good dish of 7. The salmon was small and bland. Again nothing to write home about. The dessert was a variety of different sweets, all of which were frozen. Talk about mass produced and definitely not made to order. We also didn't get the bread until after our soup salad which we must of asked for 3 times. Sidenote it would of been nice of her to also offer bread while I was waiting for my husband . n nWith a bill of 310 I wish we would of stuck to our normal ruth's chris or capital grille. Never ever will I go to Quiessence again or recommend it. This is sad to me because my husband and I work in an industry where we host high profile clients for lunch and dinner on a daily basis and finding gems in Phoenix is rare. n nRegarding ambiance I used to live in Japan and it reminded me a lot of old alley restaurants you find there where people turn old houses into restaurants. We were sitting on a patio in the corner with an old school window AC unit and dirt backyard. So weird and definitely not romantic.",1
"In Short.Decent Atmosphere, Average overall food Quality.WAAYYY Too Expensive. n nFor a place famous for it's steaks and ribs I was sorely disappointed. I was with a group of about 7 people. The Big Hamburger that was ordered medium by one person in my party came well done and dry as the desert. The initial helping of all you can eat beef ribs was pretty good.if a little too saucy.with the meat falling off the bone. but the additional helpings were AWFUL! TERRIBLY under cooked and had to order 2 additional helpings just to get 3 bites of edible meat.the second helping didn't even appear to have been cooked and I had to fight to get 3 bites off of EIGHT Ribs.Just Awful. n nThe Outback, Texas Roadhouse and Saltgrass Steakhouse are less expensive and provide much better fare. n nThe atmosphere is country western with a band that plays occasionally and virtually all the staff we dealt with were friendly and accommodating. If only the food was better I might have been abe to give this place 3 maybe even 4 stars, but it is a restaurant after all.so good food should be the focus",1
It's way too loud in here. I prefer the Central Ave. location.,1

"YUCK. n nAfter seeing this place on Man vs Food, i wanted to go there and try the Burrito, so i got the miniture 10 one. One of the Worst Burritos I've ever had! Im so glad i decided not to take the challenge. n nThe hot wongs were dry and didnt have flavor. It took forever to get our food. I think the best part was the Curly fries, those were very good thats why they piled them on! cuz they know their food sucks. nNEVER AGAIN!.Should've just gone to the Bellagio Buffet!",1
"This is a nice hotel only because its brand spanking new. I've been twice and it's already aging the room control screen in our last room wasn't working, the mattress was getting saggy, and the plumbing was making noise. Also, its just not that nice after you really experience it for a few days. There's no where to eat outside on those rare pleasant Las Vegas mornings that you really should try to take advantage of . The pool has limited hours, and you're not allowed to bring outside food or drink out there anyway. It's downright tacky the lengths that the hotel will go to to prevent you from bringing in outside food including the staffer interrogating the family with a newborn about whether they were trying to sneak in baby food . They have no recycling or water conservation policy that we could find. And, worst of all, the internet really didn't work. For a pricier hotel, we had much higher expectations.",1
"I never thought I would say this about this place but I have to be honest. This place was TERRIBLE when we went there to eat. nYes, I know its a ""bar "" atmosphere, but I had eaten there before with my family and it had been a good experience in all manners both food and service . n nBut recently an experience that I had was horrible in both manners. First of all , the food was HORRIBLE. The order had 2 different things wrong with it and besides that , the taste was NOT fresh at all. The tacos werent good at all. n nThen , the person I was with had ordered a beer , which was on happy hour and when the server which was horrible too , came back asked if he wanted another beer, he said yes and she didnt bother to tell us that it was going to be regular price which was more than double the price of happy hour cause we missed it by a ""few minutes "" . So the happy hour beer was 2.00 and the regular priced same beer ws 4.50.! nWhen I asked the server about the change she was just irritated with me that i questioned her. nThe entire thing was TERRIBLE. the server was too busy talking to other staff and ignoring our table and they werent that busy in the restaurant, so its not like it was a challenge. Overall I would rate this as horrible and I will NEVER go here again.EVER",1
"Great place to hang out with a big party plenty of room. I'm not really a Sushi person so I won't bore you with my insight. n My California roll and Eel roll were pretty good for the 5 and 7 bucks I paid for them. I also had the Calamari and it was quite good it was strips of Calamari and the sauce had a little Asian twist. I not a fan of Teppanyaki either I think its to pricey for meat, rice, and veggies but they were packed so it must be good I'm guessing",2

"I used to love Napolis and ordered from them all the time. So far this year I have spent over 500. The last 2 times were a complete disgrace with my order. I ordered a week ago, and the food didnt come for 2 hours. The restaurant said sorry they screwed up and it could be out in 45 minutes. I asked if they could guarantee the food here by that time because it had almost been 3 hours and then couldnt guarantee anything so I canceled the order. I decided to give it another shot last night and ordered a well done pizza. The pizza was falling apart and was very sloppy. I also had tipped the delivery driver over 20. The manager refused to come get the pizza, or even replace it. I hadnt even eaten the pizza because it was that bad, I only had 1 slice. Now i feel a little queezy this morning and my stomach isnt happy with the food I put in my body last night. You cant treat customers like this or else your business will tank. I would not recommend ordering food from this place, your better off going to a fast food restaurant.",1

She sweetened the deal a bit more, won't say what but again, not expected and what an awesome gesture for my first purchase.

Awesome show. My friend took my other friend and I there for our birthdays. Simply amazing. We had seats kind of close to the front. Although we missed the first 10 minutes or so I definitely would recommend this as a must see show in Vegas. I think I wanted to take of the performers home. All of the them were amazing.,2
We have been here about a dozen times. The food is always fresh. The employees are friendly and Nick always remembers us. The place is small but they now deliver in the neighborhood. I highly recommend the falafel pita and fish and chips. They have the BEST fries.,2

It's an attractive place, clean and beautifully decorated. The staff is attentive, their manner soothing from the moment you walk in. And the service lasted until the moment I walked out the door.after the massage, I was offered water, tea and cookies and even got a bit of shoulder massage as I stood there drinking it. The prices are very reasonable. I have had massage in some very upscale salons, and they don't hold a candle to the experience I had here. It was awesome. Wow.",2
"Hiromaru originated in Japan and they still have locations there. They have 2 doors use the left one. My main mission was to try their black garlic ramen since that's my favorite ramen of all. I was very impressed with how clean and slick the interior looks. Red accent wall, white walls, red chairs my favorite color. I had great expectations but I was very much disappointed. This replaced the good ol' Cafe de Japon you will be missed . I thought this place would be packed since they're new and people would want to try this place but no. n nI went here with Tu Anh and Tony who've been here a few times since they opened.

We were given a mixed greens salad with a light dressing and immedicately, Tony said the salad was better when they first opened. n nHiromaru Buns nThe pork belly was tasty.

One side is supposed to be soft and the other side crisp with slight burn marks. Well, theirs has burn marks around one side of each gyoza and the rest seemed raw.

"I'm surprised there are people on here, who think they're treated rudely and abruptly at the Golden Greek. What makes you think you're so special?! EVERYONE here is treated that way! n nFood at the Golden Greek is something akin to what hospital patients in Athens would eat.

Don't be surprised if your dinner is cooking a second time under the heat lamps while she holds a chit chat with elderly guests, who just flew in from ""I have nothing better to do with my life than talk endlessly "" Land. But the real workhorse in that place is Mom, a stocky, incredibly muscularly built woman with calves every man at the gym would die for, who cooks, cleans, and is the only one with a sense of humor . she especially loves to laugh when you complain or drop something on the floor. And speaking of dropping something on the floor, DO enjoy the many screams and crashing plates you'll hear in the back of the restaurant from the three of them while you're trying to enjoy the bland food think of it as ethnic entertainment straight from the Greek version of ""Married With Children "". n nAll in all reasonably decent food, but the yelling and attitude have more spice than the mousaka.",1
My husband and I tried it out. The wait was extremely long. When we got seated our waitress did not even explain how the menu worked or how the steaks are cooked. She was rather rough and said crude jokes. My meal came out fine after another very long wait. My husbands came out wrong. It was tough and way overdone. He pointed it out and they did take it back and redo it after some more time. Our waitress was never around and we ran out of drinks. The manager was nice and came out and refilled our drinks a couple of times. I also felt the price was very inflated for the quality of the food we received. I was Not impressed.,1

"Great, great market with terrific vendors and specialty shops. The produce is gorgeous, although I do question where it comes from, since it is very often not seasonal to Montreal.

"Ok so although Im tempted to give this place a 1 star, I will be fair and give them 2 because their sushi is always fresh, that is if you have a few hours to wait for it to arrive, with that being said, that is my biggest complaint. I moved to phoenix 5 years ago, this was the 1st place my husband took me to, and I loved it, the sushi was amazing although their menu is very limited and boring and their mussels are the best in the valley, they dont stuff it with crab meat, like the other places we went to. However within the past few years, their service has declined tremendously, their host looks like a kid who does not know much about greeting customers, most of the time looks confused, I havent seen more than 2 servers working on their busiest nights, which ofcourse is a very big problem. We used to like this place also because its pretty close and we thought it would be a convenient location for a quick stop, well that is absolutely not the case, we went there a few days ago, which is definitely our last time, my husband and I had to wait 45 minutes just to get edemame soybeans , then 30 min later we received our appetizer, now maybe some people dont mind, but I have 2 kids at home and I dont have all the time in the world on a weekday to sit at a sushi spot for 3 hours just to eat dinner. I was so irritated, the server kept apologizing, and ofcourse i know its not his fault, he was waiting for the chefs to prepare our sushi, but they looked like they were in no rush, taking their time chatting away with people sitting in the bar area. The waiter then told me that if we sat at the bar, we would be served sooner, which is complete bullshit, I go to dinner with my husband to enjoy dinner and talk with my husband and not sit at the bar watching them make my sushi, i like my privacy once in a while considering I have 2 little kids at home! So 2 hours into dinner we asked for the check before they could finish our 2 last rolls, my husband paid and we left, what a horrible experience, I dont think i was ever that irritated in a restaurant.",1
thank you for delivering my pizza on time not thank you for delivering it to a wrong address. a great customer service is calling customer's if they received there orders. waited two hours.,1
Wow. I've had better pasta out of a can. If you don't have a litter of kids to feed this is not the place for anyone who's ever had anything close to real Italian food. We ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce and spicy sausage with ricotta. As you can see from the photo the sauce seems to be missing from the pasta. However there was a generous portion of red water in the bottom of the bowl. Our server was really nice and I feel bad that he is working at such a terrible restaurant having to tell people they get a TON of food. As if that made up for zero quality. We spent too much money for about 3 bites of food. The rest will go in the garbage. I've seen better food at soup kitchens. We will never be back and will never regret it. This was our first visit and it seemed everyone else's first visit also at the tables around us. They must rely on first time business since its doubtful anyone will ever come back.,1
"From reading the reviews on this place, I always thought there were two floors to this place.I just got that confirmed, thanks. n nI decided to go somewhere that had trivia on Tuesday nights. We read that BF had trivia on Tuesdays, so we decided to check it out. We entered and was told that trivia was held in the area to the left and to find a seat. We arrived about 8 45pm and it was PACKED. There weren't any seats available. As we were figuring out what to do, two ladies were leaving, so we got us a table within five minutes. n n They had specials on Blue Moons 3 and Coors Lights 2 that night, which was good with me, haha. They have a full menu here to eat from if you're hungry which I was . I started off with an appetizer some chicken quesadillas , which were VERY good. For my meal, I tried the Blackened Chicken Alfredo which was decent.the noodles seemed a tad bit overcooked.kinda rubberey . They had TV screens all over the place, playing mostly baseball I guess b c that's the only main sport on right now . Trivia was supposed to begin at 9pm. It got started around 9 15 or so. They had 4 different trivias that night. One was about 90's TV shows, one was about movies, one was about music, but the catch was it was ALL country artists, which definitely is not my cup of tea.got 4 right out of 12, and I was suprised I got that many right, haha. The other trivia was some puzzle kinda thing which had my mind going.too much thinking required after downing about 4 beers, haha. n nOverall, I really like this place and now that I know that there's an upstairs to check out, i'll be sure to check that out the next time I go here. As a matter of fact, I might check this place out for my birthday on Friday",2
"This location is very disappointing. The last time I went, they were out of the coffee I always come for, every table was dirty, and the guy at the counter definitely doesn't belong in customer service. I don't even think he said hi when I approached the counter, just waited for me to order awkward. I will say, I could drink the Vanilla Hazelnut coffee and eat the Lox Bagel everyday for the rest of my life. Since this one is closest to where I live, I really hope they fix a couple things so it could be as great as the other locations.",1
Took a cab from Sky Harbor to Old Town. The driver didn't speak English very well and tried to take me up the freeway. I told him to go up 64th he said that was the long way. He said I was wrong and he knew how to go that the freeway was the fastest. It's not it's about 10 dollars more. As we got off the 202 at Scottsdale rd. made the driver drop me at the Dennys and called Discount Cab. They saved the day.,1
"Marketing only greenwash and healthy washed, really just a lackluster meal with a hefty pricetag that isn't that green or healthy. Styrofoam cup anyone?",1
"Had to write in response to Tom H. I'm a regular at Cibo, even though I live 25 miles away. It seems to me that this was a table that was just not going to be happy no matter what. Without exception, every time I've gone to Cibo I've been warmly welcomed by both the owners and the wait staff and the level of service they provide is laid back and exceptional. They're not hovering over your table waiting for you to take your last bite so they can whip the plate from under your nose but they are discreet and attentive at all times. There is a family atmosphere in this restaurant and just watching how much the wait staff love their bosses and what a good time they seem to have at work makes me jealous I don't have a boss like that! I have brought countless friends and family to Cibo for all sorts of occasions and am made to feel like a VIP every time I walk throught the front door. As someone who eats out quite a lot and has been in the service industry, albeit many years ago, I find it amazing that a group of six would argue with a busy waiter about splitting a check six ways, how embarrassing. What is the problem with just putting in cash for your share when you know you're eating as a large group? Or even splitting it evenly between three couples on credit cards. And complaining about a 20 gratuity? Show me any good restaurant that doesn't charge an inclusive gratuity for parties of 6 or more. As for the comments about refills always have my water and coffee refilled as soon as it gets low and the portion sizes, well I've yet to bring anybody to Cibo who can finish a whole salad and pizza, the portions are more than generous. Overall I feel I'm a discerning diner who has high standards and I've found a real gem in Cibo, so excuse me if I'm a little overprotective but I feel that Tom H's review was completely unfair to the amazing ambience and fabulous staff at Cibo.",2
"LIED LIED LIED LIED. went in to upgrade my wife's phone and was told about the Verizon tablet and it being on special and being only 10 a month. I and my wife both asked what the extra charges would be, activation, data etc. We were both told no other fees would be charged at all. n nTen days later we got a bill in the mail for activation fees and many other things to include a new line service and data package for this new tablet. Called customer service and got the run around and was told I would get a call back never did. Called again and was told a supervisor would call within 48 hours, nothing. Called a 3rd time and finally got someone that gives a crap, turns out the store opened a WHOLE NEW SUB ACCOUNT this new sub account was already at 200 additional dollars owed on top of what my 'main' account was. n nSo breaking this down the man at this store lied bold faced, then opened a hidden account I had no access to this account on my verizonwireless.com account and added all kinds of things to the account that I did not ask to have. My only guess is that they get a commission of some sort and that he was padding his for the month. After i fixed all this with the 3rd and finally smart customer service lady I returned to the store. Eric the manage was at the door he started listening then shut me down and sent me to someone else that I had to start explaining it all to again. They seemed concerned and claimed the guy no longer worked there but.liars are gonna lie. I have a hard time believing what I was told on this final trip.",1
"5 star food, n3 star customer service. n nMaybe it has alot to do with how they are ALWAYS busy. I heard they will be expanding soon, hopefully it will help wait times. Great Alfredo.you gotta try the garlic bread!",2
"Hey Brooksys, n nWe love this place ever since we had a Groupon. You have great food , drink prices, and shuffleboard is fun too! The only thing you are missing that would make me and my friends frequent much more often is if we could play Buzztime trivia at your place. We want someplace other than Buffalo Wild Wings to eat and play trivia! Please consider getting this trivia. Check out the site. http www.getbuzztime.com Thanks!",2
"Came here on my birthday in April and was blown away with the food, the decor and the service. They sat me at a table by the open windows, with a direct view onto the pools. For the appetizer, I chose the frog legs with the meyer lemon butter. MMMMMMMM so good. The entree was a nice, thick, juicy, succulent, um amazing bone out New York Strip cooked perfectly Medium Rare. My sides were the onion rings which were just OK and the truffle mac and cheese which was to die for. This was one of my best meals in Vegas and I have eaten at some of the top restaurants in town. That was one of the best steaks I have ever had. Will be going back to Botero on my next trip, as I will be staying at Encore again.",2
"I had this pho a couple years ago and it is not the same anymore. I was a little scared when this place is a 24 hour restaurant. It is a great idea for vegas, but not for a consistent flavor of pho soup. n nThe service is ok like any other pho place. The server would come to our table when we just sat down and wait until we decide. n nThe pho does not have a clear sweet broth with a full load of complex spiced flavor. There was a cloudiness to the soup. The bo vien meatball has a consistency of an Italian meatball but it has no flavor at all. Usually the bo vien has a bounciness when I bite into it. The brisket and rare flank tasted fine. n nThe vermicelli w grilled pork and egg roll was not the best I've tasted. However if I was craving for this after all the buffet I went to, this will do. n The grilled pork is lean and nicely charred, but not too mind blowing of a flavor. n It's missing the sweet crusted part of the pork. The egg n The egg roll were nice and crispy. The stuffing inside was smushy. I couldn't n the meat, veggies, or vermicelli.",1
"Great menu, fast, and delicious! Perfect for wanting something quick and cheap! Will definitely return!",2
"This place is random. R A N D O M random. I don't ""get "" it. nWent for lunch, while taking a break from medical testing at the Mayo Clinic. This place was empty. Ok, there were a half dozen other people there, but it barely counts with the size of the place. nNow, I like that there is a stage guess who thought of doing comedy there?! and that they have live music that promotes local bands. I am all for that. But, there comes a point when you can't have the place seem too classy for that sort of thing. Framed pictures of different musical icons are nice, but overplayed. Everywhere else. nIt just doesn't work here at Compound Grill. nI had the fish n chips for lunch. 5 nuggets of fish places over a bowl of fries that weren't anything special. When will people stop serving shoestring fries? It was cool that everything was served in a bowl made from an old record that had been warped into.the shape of a bowl, though. nService was friendly and attentive. The manager or owner or whoever he was also present. I'm guessing because they though there would be a lunch rush. nFor this area, in N Phoenix, so close to the 101 51 and N Scottsdale, I would expect a bigger lunch crowd. Without it, I guess shows I'm not the first person to just find the place ""meh. """,1
"Our arrival was seamless! Off plane straight to baggage claim, the out to your check station curbside. Since I made my reservations online and paid di counted van was waiting and off to Hotel. We were first off and had a fabulous time in Vega !Departing was super easy. Received confirmation text day before. Got arrival text 30 min before within reserved window! Rosemary was SUPER friendly and conversational! Van was especially clean and she was very punctual! Very professional. Thank you for coming to Las Vegas.

"WHEW Sweet Baby Jesus! The food here was amazing! I wont lie after eating at the one in The Plaza I was a little turned off by their food. However after some convincing I am glad I made this trip! I got the Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict. MOUTH WATERING! The mashed potatoes were amazing, The biscuits soft, the chicken juicy and crispy! Just amazing!",2
"I headed into Caesars, turning left into the lobby, where we grabbed a drink while waiting for some clients. The bar proved to be the facade for Central Michael Richard, where we were immediately told that they only carry two types of vodka as opposed to Grey Goose, which we ordered even though the shelves above the bar were laden with varieties. . .including Grey Goose. Figuring the bottles were solely accoutrements, we went about our business when our clients, famished, suggested we grab a bite at Central itself. n nIt appeared to be a pseudo upscale coffee shop, but was also empty. That, especially after the liquor snafu, should have been an indication of the without a soul nature of this restaurant, but we proceeded. Upon receiving the menu, I laughed audibly French Onion soup is 19 18 with Caesars Total Rewards membership and a house salad was 16 again, a dollar off! with Rewards . My issue isn't so much with the prices this is 'new' Vegas, and Michael Richard is a formidable chef so that's acceptable what makes it so laughable is that a restaurant that's clearly a coffee shop the menus are the laminated plastic like Denny's! would charge this much for basic items. . .yet still offer a negligible discount. Very corny, very amateur. n nRegardless, we ordered standard fare burger, fries, chili cheese fries, the aforementioned salad, chicken tenders and left with a 150 bill for six people, which included only the one drink. The food was average, but again the inherent confusion in what they really want this restaurant to be was evident. They bring out the fries in a cute, mini grocery cart eg Father's Office in L.A. , but accompany it with ketchup in a plastic cup. I mean, there were no porcelain ramekins? Nothing to match the cuteness of the cart? What a turnoff. n nThe funniest part of the meal, though, was when they brought out the candles it's funny that they have candles in a bright, mid lobby venue that's clearly a coffee shop but. . .the candles were the electronic tea lights. You know, the ones that simulate flickering. How cheap crappy can you get? And that's where those prices come in. Honestly, we were laughing over and over amongst ourselves, not least of all after finishing the tiny burger and chili cheese fries, both of which were 'small plate' portion sized. n nI'm sorry, Caesars, you were my favorite hotel growing up and the new towers are passable in the modern era, but please eradicate this restaurant or at least overhaul the place and do justice to Chef Richard because it's a serious pockmark on what is a rapidly decaying property.",1
"U swirl is my least favorite of the frozen yogurt chains. I have been to this one and the one on charleston. The yogurt itself seems much less smooth to me than other places like it hasn't been frozen properly and thus has ice crystals in it. Granted I have only been twice, but each time I got two flavors 4 total and they were all like that. Maybe that is something some people enjoy, but I much prefer the smoother Menchies style yogurt. n nThe toppings these seem to now be exactly the same at every yogurt place so since the yogurt itself is not as good I do not go back to u swirl.",1
"Came here for restaurant week, and went into it with pretty high expectations. n nVery unassuming from the outside, Harvest is a surprisingly expansive restaurant with a main section right when you walk in, and a lower, bigger section to the left. The dim lighting gives this place more of an intimate ambiance, making it a great date spot. n nAlso, a quick tip if you're intimidated by all the utensils always work from the outside in, meaning, use the outer forks spoons first course utensils before the inner ones main course utensils . n nOk, now on to the good part, the food. For my three courses, I got the crispy cauliflower and brussel sprouts salad, the braised beef short ribs and the house made chocolate stout gelato. n nThe salad was a great first course, as it was light and refreshing. The cauliflower and brussel sprouts had a slightly burnt taste, which complemented well with the semi sweet dressing. The bits of bacon also added another dimension to the salad, by giving it a more cured taste. n nThe entree of braised beef was absolutely out of this world. The beef was cooked to perfection, and was soft and tender enough to be cut with your fork. The potato pur u00e9e was smooth and silky, fitting in with the tender theme. The only grief I had was that I wish there was more of the delicious sauce, but we can't have everything. n nAnd last but not least, the gelato closed out the meal. The chocolate stout gelato was just creamy enough, without being overwhelmingly rich, that kept the dish light and easy to eat. n nSeeing as how all of my friends were satisfied with their meals, I'd say this night was a smashing success. There was also just enough food for us to be full, but not to the point of wanting to pass out due to food coma. n nSo far, I'd say this was the best meal I've had in Madison yet! n nCame here for restaurant week, went into it with pretty high expectations, walked away with surpassed expectations.",2
"The staff is awesome, very clean restaurant especially considering the location , but the prices are little out of control.",2
"Decided to eat here rather than n bothering cooking on a Friday nite. Despite the line, we were able to get a table right away. Though it was crowded and kind of loud it was a good meal. The California roll was great. Highly recommend the kids spaghetti w meatballs. Service was fast and food was good. Lots of options, especially for kids and not a lot of fried food. Would come back again.",2
"I visited Spago for the first time early on a Friday evening and was treated like an old friend. n nThe general manager, Michael Schwarz was very attentive and made sure that I was well taken care of. The place has a warm, friendly neighborhood vibe which is created and encouraged by the staff, which is amazing considering it is smack dab in the middle of Las Vegas. Peter our bartender was delightful and the cocktails were the best I'd had in Vegas. n nIf you are looking for a fun place to chat over dinner and drinks, people watch, and not feel like you are deep in the Vegas scene, this is the best place to go.",2
"What are people thinking when they design come up with places like this? I have been to Station Square several times and I have been disoriented each of those times. A design shouldn't make you feel like you are lost at every turn. It shouldn't make you feel like you have no idea where you are. It's no wonder that the place is not filled with business nor with people. n nSteps that need to be taken to make this place better n1. Think about the circulation. It is very bad. You can play with surprise in the design, but you need to leave people a tether back to a safe or known place. Right now there is no tether. There is nothing worse than feeling disoriented in a building. n2. Ingress and egress is so difficult to find for Station Square. It should be utterly obvious the difference between a mall entrance and store or restaurant entrance. If it is not obvious, then people will feel tricked. Leave the Easter Egg hunts for Easter. n3. This has been set up as a tourist destination. That is fine, but you need to make certain you have enough tourists to keep all the business afloat. With only one hotel to easily feed an entire complex with tourists, something tells me that someone just threw this design together a tad to hastily. When a Starbucks pulls out due to lack of business, that is saying something. Bring in more items for locals and rethink the business strategy here. n nThis is one of the worst designs for a waterfront that I have ever seen. At least the waterfront in Homestead gives ample parking and retail that the locals actually want to use. Station Square needs to be reformatted.",1

"I was in here often in early May because I needed to get some last minute things before my field research in Costa Rica in mid May late June. n nWere it not for the paranoid staff members consistently checking literally every few minutes to make sure I wasn't shoplifting ""Do you need any help? "" retail fu for, ""I'm checking to make sure you're not stealing anything. "" or the ridiculously high prices, I probably would've bought more there instead of getting things online. n nHowever, there was a nice sale and I bought some really great breathable pants there that made being in the rainforest so, so much more comfortable. n nThe products are great, the services and prices not so much. Because I'm not really an outdoorsy person, I don't see myself coming back either.",1

"We were very pleased with our stay at the Mirage in Las Vegas. We booked our trip through Travelocity and got a pretty good rate, complete with a 50 food beverage credit. We had an early flight, so we arrived in Vegas around 10am. Check in is 3pm. Oh no. Well, turns out The Mirage rocks. I went to the front desk to ask if they may hold our bags until check in, that way we wouldn't have to lug our luggage around. She did better than that, she said our room was already ready to go. Sweet! The woman that helped us was so nice! Great first impression. I will note that you will have a 200 deposit. no matter what. We found it strange since our room was already fully paid for months in advance, but oh well. Resort fees are about 30, which is standard at any hotel on the strip. Our room was gorgeous, we had a strip view and we were on the 22nd floor. The view was so nice, especially at night. The decor was very modern, and the room was comfortable. No complaints. The walls were a bit thin as we could hear people conversing outside, but it wasn't to the level of bothersome. The bathroom came complete with shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash. yay! Oh, and skip the mini bar! Unless you want to pay 6 for a water bottle. n nThe reason I'm giving a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the hotel itself. I noticed that the casino in the Mirage was quite smokier than some of the other casinos we visited, but I guess that's just something you have to accept in Vegas. The pool at the Mirage is also FREEZING! I should have had my husband film me as I got in, because that was the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge right there! This was in August, so it was a scorcher out. Yet nobody was in the pool, except a few kids of course. Kids don't seem to feel cold. Weirdos. Also, I'm not a fan of the dining options in the hotel. I noticed that other hotels such as the Venetian, Caesar's, Flamingo, etc. all had food courts. The Mirage has no such thing. This makes for pricier meals or having to walk off property to grab a bite. n nOverall, the central location of The Mirage is fantastic. I would definitely consider staying here again. Now if you guys could turn the temperature up on the pool, I'd be forever grateful!",2
"I forgot about this hole in the wall! If your afraid to go into the not so glamorous, upscale, part of Las Vegas, and you just want some real food! I would say go here. They open about 12 00. If your not use to this area, I would suggest to go maybe before 5 p.m. We went on a Thursday night. It was an older crowd in the bar area, it was a ""step'n night "" so the crowd is different on this night, than on a Friday Saturday night. n nNow don't go in here thinking your going to get what you ordered in 4 5 min. Nope! That isn't going to happen. They cook to order! And it is worth the wait. The chicken is so crunchy and seasoned! I can say it's better than mine! I love crunchy chicken. n nThe Catfish is the bomb.com! Yep, I think it's the best place to get fried catfish in this town. And if you know, like I know, it's hard to find. n nThe greens were good, and the fries are good. They have yams I don't care for yams I'm not sure what else. n nSo, go place your order, and go sit at the bar, and have a drink or 2. It will take about 30 min. for them to fry up that yummie chicken!",2

"I forgot that Mr. Tofu was closed on Sundays and my sundubu craving had to be pacified so we made our way across the street to Tofu Hut. Half of the restaurant have stovetop tables reserved for patrons having the AYCE korean barbecue, while the other half of the restaurant has tables for the tofu eating patrons. Although the bbq smelled enticing, I was there for one reason and one reason only sundubu. n nI ordered my go to the mushroom sundubu. The menu described it as having 3 different kinds of mushrooms, but I can guarantee that I only saw 1 type in there. The enoki and the oyster mushrooms were no where to be seen. And on top of that I ordered ""medium "" spice level, and there was no heat at all. Nor was there any flavor. I poured the entire kimchee side dish and some bulgogi into the soup in order to create an edible bowl. Only after those measures, did I start to enjoy my sundubu. However, it wasn't my original order. n nMy husband seemed to enjoy his kimchi sundubu, but the ""spicy "" level, tasted more ""medium "". So be warned, that you may have to order a higher spice level just to get some heat. The bulgogi was very flavorful, and the banchan was not my favorite. My kids, however, devoured the korean pancakes, although they are a lot thicker than I am used to. n nAnd I don't understand why almost every korean restaurant that we dine at, there is only one server. Poor guy is running around like a chicken with his head cut off. He was trying his best to meet everyone's needs, but we had to wait a while for extra napkins, extra chopsticks after my son threw them on the floor, and water refills. And then we waited a while to pay our bill.",1
Sapporo is solid. Went with boyfriend and family visiting from out of town for teppan happy hour 7 days a week. 3 7pm . As entertaining and delicious as promised. A ton of food.

"I used to like this place but its gone downhill in the last year. The pedicures are pretty good but skip the manis, shellac gel, and acrylic nails. I travel often for my job flight attendant so I sometimes end up getting a fill somewhere else. Well, apparently the staff does not like the fact that you've gone elsewhere. I came in for a fill and the gal said I need to have the nails completely soaked off and start over. I wasn't sure why as only one nail was broken. She got an attitude and proceeded to wrench my previous set off via sticking a nail tip underneath the acrylic and shoving, pulling and ripping the acrylic straight off my nail bed! It was painful and I said no more, just soak them off while I'm getting a pedicure. She kept asking where I had the previous set done and I told her the short guy who works there did the set. She tried to tell me no, couldn't have been done here as our acrylic comes off in a 10 minute acetone soak. I soaked my nails all the way thru a pedicure and they still wouldn't come off. She again proceeded to try and wrench them off very painful and actually tore my thumb nail bed completely in half! It was bleeding and hurt. I told her no more acylics for me as I didn't want to go thru that again. I asked for shellac and she said no, your thumb is split grabbing my thumb and showing me like its my fault . Like an idiot I went ahead and had another full acrylic set done. That was two days ago and the corners are already lifting. The attitude of the nail tech was ridiculous. I'm sooo tired of all the nail techs from foreign countries with attitudes and of course they talk about the customers in their language which is just rude. nI won't be returning to this salon as they are very rough and have an attitude to match, as well they do very poor work.",1

I really like the cupcakes but the customer service is lacking, My husband and I went in, there were 2 ladies in front of us.

I was going up and down each aisle trying to find my dang hummus. n nIs it in the dips aisle? Soups? Sauces? Is it with the cheeses? Yogurt? NOOOOO! was getting frustrated and close to having a panic attack. I found the friggin hummus next to the deli turkey and fried chicken!

"I have been a few times now and always leave happy. The duck confit hash was great. The steel cut oats were great. The tuna melt is the best I've ever had. And one time I had a burger that was delicious. n nHowever, they get a few things wrong. I haven't had everything on the menu so I can't speak to everything but I have had a few things I didn't like. Their soups, for instance, don't always come out tasting as great as they sound. I have had one that was incredibly salty, and another that was just bland. Also, all of their sandwiches come with a red cabbage salad which should be delicious. But, instead it comes out tasting like a sour mess filled with what I think are fennel seeds, maybe anise. And to upgrade to a classy green salad smothered with balsamic costs another 1.50.who the hell upcharges for greens? n nAll in all their food is great and I feel safe ordering anything on the menu, except for soups. Also, next time I will just ask for nothing on the side as the mound of red cabbage always tempts.but also always disappoints.",2
"In theory, I like the idea of using a local business as opposed to the big, impersonal banks. but I'm getting fed up with DS, which I only have for a home loan. n nI dread every time I have to access the Online system, because it is cumbersome. Because we don't want to use them for checking, there is a fee for Online payments, which is a pain. It's extremely challenging to get assistance with password issues, due to limited hours for tech support. Once you do get through, you face a ridiculous interrogation to get access to your own account. so if you like to have a lot of layers of inconvenience to prove that your account is secure, then this is the place for you. n nGiven I can't pay Online, I called to request additional payment coupons. The coupons never arrived but I've started getting daily calls about my late payment. continuing even after following up with an explanation and 2nd request for the coupons. Seriously, after 10 years of on time payments, I don't need to be harrassed by collection calls making me feel like a deadbeat.",1
"This place was great when it was called Mark Rich's NY Pizza. The new place has gone way downhill. I used to love their pizza, but now it's way below average. I used to drive miles out of my way to eat here, but no more. It's just not the same. The staff changed and I guess they changed cooks.",1
"Orbitz said this place was 4 STARS. No way is this rated 4 stars. I was really dissapointed but I should of known better when I seen how cheap this place cost. It should have been a red flag when I called and was on hold for like 10 minutes just to ask about pool hours or when their own website doesn't even have pictures of their resort. Anyhow, the staff was very nice, no complaints but here are the cons 1 The exterior parking is ghetto, you have to go up a curb to park. 2 My room safe didn't work, 3 Bathroom facet dripped, 4 Shower door kept going off the rail, 4 One of the 2 bathroom doors didn't lock, 5 No daily room service. This place sucked.",1
"I love everything about Pita Jungle. They have huge portions, a big menu, and delicious fresh food. I've been a loyal Pita Jungle junkie for a while now and I have never once left being unsatisfied.

You need to try it! n nThe atmosphere of this place during the nighttime is great for a date, the staff is super friendly, and everything about this place screams ARTSY! Great ambience and good food. love this place!",2
"Decided to take the family's last 2014 dinner here. I came out full and pleased with money to spare. It's a small restaurant with an open feel. The furniture has a dark wood tone that gives off a slight traditional feel but with actual seating. The menu is simple and if you're not sure what to order, the servers are very informative. The price won't kill anyone. Good place for lunch to late snack. Alcohol is available but Japanese brands only. The soda is purchased by the can. They do provide a glass w ice. The only thing I regret is not coming to this place years ago. We are now going to be regulars to this place.",2
"Largest combo platter I've ever had at a BBQ joint and I've had many. The half rack of ribs was bigger than some places full rack. At only 20 for a large combo platter, it's also one of the cheaper ""a little of everything "" BBQ meals. I couldn't believe the pile of meat that showed up on my table. And unlike other BBQ joints where the sides come in dixie cups, the sides at Mac's came out on a completely separate full sized dinner plate. The brisket was amazing. It had a delicious tangy, smokey taste. The pulled pork was some of the best I've had. Chicken and ribs were also very good. And the red BBQ sauce on the table was phenomenal. I put a little extra on everything, even though it didn't need it. And I washed it all down with delicious sweet tea. After eating for an hour, we still couldn't fit all the leftovers in our take out box. n nOur server forgot to bring our chicken wings. But with so much food we actually thanked her for forgetting. She was very nice about it and even though we weren't upset at all she gave us a very considerable discount on our bill. I will definitely return to Mac's on my next visit to Charlotte.",2
"Wow. For a place which advertises donuts and drive thru service, you'd never expect the inside of this little gem to be as nice and mature as it is. I was almost shocked when I walked in and saw dark wood paneling and tables, a very attractive counter and a very clean kitchen you can see right into. n nThat this is so close to my house that it may not be the best thing for me. I guess I could work up a jogging to donuts routine. How many donuts can you work off in a half mile? Everything I've had here has been simple and top notch. The donuts and other pastries have a fluffiness to them that can't be matched by donut chains, this place does it right. And extra right, they have freakin' donut samples on the counter while you decide what you want. It is a pretty good guarantee that you want a donut after that. n nWonderful coffee, not overly cheery staff and a nice, relaxed atmosphere means I'll be coming back for lunch very soon.",2

"At the end of the day food comes down to quality and price. n nSo I had what ever they call a double burger, fries and a soda. Came to 8.50 tax included. n nSo a couple immediate observations. n nAbout price. I can get the same meal at In and Out for at least 2 cheaper. I can get a far larger burger at Fudruckers for the same price. n nSo now about quality. For less money the In and Out burger is far better quality. For the same amount of money the Fudruckers is far better quality. n nNone of the above is to say that the burger here was bad. Rather, you can get better quality for less or the same elsewhere. The only thing unique here is how they cook the hamburger. But it isn't worth the extra over In and Out and doesn't even approach the higher quality bar set by Fudruckers for the same price. n nSo at the end of the day I'm left trying to figure out what's the big deal is about this place. Beats the heck out of me.",1
"The range itself is pretty nice but I didn't enjoy my experience at all. I have been a gun owner and shooter for 25 years and abide by all safety rules. I understand the concern for safety but the way these range officers go about it is ridiculous. I witnessed a range office literally scream at person for accidentally putting steel cased shells in the brass bucket. The RO was rude, condesending, and aggressive. I would not recommend this place if you are a new shooter due to the range officers causing an intimating atmosphere when a new shooter is already nervous. In my opinion, their behavior actually contributes to bad safety practices because the shooters are so scared of doing something wrong they are overthinking it. One more thing, for those that love shooting outdoors in the blm areas. From my understanding this range is working very hard to get places like Queen Valley and other shooting areas shut down to the public. This way people have no choice but to come to their range. I will never visit this place again.",1

My friend and I have been very much anticipating a visit to JJ's. Sadly we were very disappointed. The staff was unfamiliar with the menu and it took over 10 minutes just to order. Our food arrived before our beers. I can honestly say I can make a better Chicago style dog at home. The seasoned chips were the best part of the meal and the manager looked like he had just crawled out from under a car in a garage. The only reason we will return would be for beer and chops on the rooftop during the summer.,1

"We were gardened and not about to be zooed out after seeing a bunch of zoos and gardens in the Midwest area. So, we decided to check this out after the Olbrich garden. This was such a nice breath of fresh air. First of all, we were confused with the driving directions being in the suburb of Middleton outside of Madison. Next, we walked in and were welcomed to see the museum first downstairs and then come back for samples. Well, the museum was really cool to see all the mustard around the world as well as all 50 states. Then, we got to sample mustard with pretzel sticks. I thought they would sell soft pretzels to dip into the mustard but was told no longer provided. Anyways, my fav was the honey mustard but not about to pay that price. Anyways, I did get some cheese curds which was reasonable for 5. Overall, not to be missed if you are in the area.",2
"my partner i stayed here about a year ago for two nights. it was great. i really liked the decor, both in the lobby area rooms. i liked the loft layout, too, and it was different the way the bed was kinda in the middle of the room. the service was great too. the only drawback is that part of town is pretty dead late at night that's good for having peace quiet and getting a good night's rest, but when we wanted a late bite to eat, there were very limited options. maybe there's more options there now. we were there summer 2010. i'd totally go back.",2
"I know, I know ""Good menu selection "" or ""Holy cow, amazing "" may not necessarily be the first thoughts that pop into mind when you think of Whisky Warehouse.

"" n nAnd as if that wasnt enough of a well rounded selection to tempt even the pickiest of eaters, they take it even one step further by offering an assortment of awesome vegetarian dishes. Who wouldn't love the Commonwealth Pasta made of whole wheat noodles, veggies and Parmesan tossed in a light, creamy sauce? Literally, whatever you're hungry for, you can find. n nHowever, the dish that takes this cake and gets all of my thanks and praises has to be the ""Elvis "" a burger even the King himself would be proud of. Served with lettuce, tomato and home cut Whisky fries, this monster patty is stacked with American cheese, bacon and PEANUT BUTTER. n Yes, you read that right the crazy combination of the juice from the burger, mixed with the creaminess of the melted cheese and saltiness from the bacon and PB, it's a combination that can only be deemed ""genius "". Well done, Chef Sam. n nBe sure and check this spot out the next time Happy Hour rolls around, the family is in town visiting or for another perfect sunny Charlotte day on the patio.

Ordered 5 items and our waitress forgot 2. All tables had their food when we ordered. And the next batch of customers did not arrive until we were finished ordering. How can you forget a 5 item order? But I digress. The check was 50 for 3 ppl, although we only had 2 peoples worth of food. Still not bad for Vegas. Would be a 3.5 star rating if judged only on the food.",1
"This was my second visit and it will be my last. The first time, a few years ago, I went for my birthday and it was ruined. It took forever and the food was horrible. Decided to give them a second chance. I give up. n nWe went last night around 6 30 p.m. and told them we had to be to a show at 7 30 p.m. and asked if it was enough time. The waitress said yes, and at least she was quick getting the food out. Too bad we didn't have time to abort mission and go somewhere else after we took one bite. The food tasted terrible but we ate it anyway, and both my husband and I had some digestive issues today. n nThis should have been a clue that the kitchen is not up to par The menu lists taco plates that come with 2 tacos and either salad or tortilla soup. I asked if I could order a plate with one machaca taco and one carnitas taco. The waitress said no, not at dinner only at lunch. Huh? So I got the carnitas and hubby got the machaca so we could share. He was concerned 2 tacos wouldn't be enough, so the waitress tells him we can order another taco a la carte. Any kind? Yes. So he gets a grilled fish taco which came out deep fried, and of course, the waitress didn't notice, and we didn't want to wait for a grilled one . Why can we get tacos a la carte but we can't split the order? This is one of those arbitrary rules that cooks make up that piss off customers and don't do anything to make the kitchen more efficient. n nSo, the food. The tortilla soup was a disgusting bowl of thick orange goop and I sent it back and got the salad with honey lime vinaigrette, which tasted neither of honey nor of lime, but more like your basic balsamic. The tacos were two corn tortillas each with a big pile of mushy, greasy, salty meat no onions, cilantro, or cotija. The carnitas came with a few small strands of pickled onion and the machaca had some past its prime guacamole gee, thanks. The meat was cooked to death, to the point where I couldn't even tell the difference between the pork and the beef. n nAs I said, the food came out fast, but why wouldn't it, when it was obvious all they had to do was scoop out a big ladleful of meat onto tortillas? Not exactly haute cuisine here. After we finished eating, we sat around for almost 15 minutes waiting for our bill, but the waitress was now MIA. I ended up going inside we were on the patio and asking the bartender for our bill. The waitress was at the server stand talking with another waitress and overheard me and I could see the look on her face of ""Oh, yeah! These people wanted to get out of here in time for a show!

"This is a review of ""The Men of Sapphire "" male revue show. n nWhat a HORRIBLE and HUMILIATING experience! I went with a huge group of girls for a birthday party. One good thing got in free. Would never pay for this total crap. So we were ushered in, through the main part of the club and into a seedy back area. Then we had to wait forever for the show to begin. Had several totally overpriced drinks 10 for a Sierra Nevada? from a rude bartender. nMe I'll have a martini with Tanqueray gin. nBartender Would you like that dirty? nMe No! Only a fool would ruin Tanqueray by pouring greasy olive juice in it. nBartender You don't look like a dirty girl. n nThen he brought the pitiful, tiny martini and it didn't even have olives in it! He seemed offended when I complained. Get real! It was 11! n nAnyway, downed 2 of those while watching the video ""preview "" of the show. It looked like it was going to be great and I was so excited. There were a whole bunch of really hot guys and they were doing things with fire. n nThen, the show began and it was nothing like the video. There were only 4 or 5 guys who kept changing their clothes, and I found only one of them semi attractive. Also, one of them was also the ""MC "" and was a total idiot! I didn't come here to listen to your inane comments you loser! I came to watch men take off their clothes! This guy kept trying to get the audience to cheer and get all hyped up. Then he would humiliate girls by making them come up on stage, where the men would force them to simulate fellatio or pretend to be doing them from behind. Some of the girls were drunk and or stupid enough to enjoy it, but let's face it, it was totally humiliating for them. One girl refused to go up and the MC kept pressuring her and putting her on the spot for a really long time. This would NEVER happen at a female strip show! The guys get to just stand there, watch enjoy. Luckilly I was not called on stage because I wouldn't have gone. n nMusic was cheesy, costumes ripped, there was no fire, and the dancing was interrupted by long, boring MC interludes.

"I've been here for three visits, two dinners and one lunch. I've been waiting to write a review, because I wanted to be fair. The service has always been pretty good here. I eat in the dining room, not the bar, and I'm greeted and seated promptly. The menu covers the basics for good BBQ ribs, pulled pork, hot links, brisket, bbq chicken. Sides are good, and portions are generous. The ribs are awful. I mean, just wretched. Two stars bad, for a joint that could be doing better. The ribs were smoked, and clearly had some dry rub on them at some point. I like my ribs Memphis style, smoke and dry rub no sauce, so this should be right up my alley, right? That's where things go awry. The ribs are clearly reheated, which is perfectly normal. What's not normal is the texture. These ribs are squishy. There is no discernible difference in texture between the lean and the fat. These ribs are reheated by some moist heat process, which both rinses all the dry rub off and removes any of the char caramelization from the grill. I saw grill marks on the ribs, so I'm not debating that the grill came into play at some point, but it was used way too little. I am begging that they change the method used to reheat the ribs. Ribs are the yardstick by which I measure good BBQ, and these aren't it. So much good stuff, but just terrible ribs.",1
"Where do I start? n nWith the false hope? The promises unmet? The astonishing laziness? The lack of understanding of even the most rudimentary customer service? n nLet's go back to the beginning. I called the folks here to see if they could replace a cracked screen on an otherwise perfectly functioning HTC EVO 4G. Meaning I could access all of the phone's features, but thought it might be nice to have a fresh, clear screen again. They said, ""Sure, we can do it for 59.99. "" I told them to order it. They said I had to come in and pay a deposit of 30. n nSo I brought it in, paid the deposit. n nProblem 1 I get a call two days later from a clerk whose voice I recognize as the young man who first took my phone in and assured me it could be done. He said, and I quote verbatim because it is seared into my memory ""Hi, I tried to order the screen from our distributor twice and they can't get it. And I don't have time to deal with it. "" n nWow. I am someone who has worked in retail, with 15 years under my belt on the floor, facing customers. If I ever said ""I don't have the time to deal with it, "" I would have been fired on the spot. n nAfter my initial shock, I told the clerk that the screen is readily available online as I was able to find it in 30 seconds and for about 10 shipped to me. I told him this and also expressed my astonishment that after paying a deposit that he would speak to me with such disrespect. He said ""Sorry, "" sheepishly and told me he'd try. I told him I was not in a hurry and was probably the easiest person on earth to deal with because I understand what a pain in the butt it can be dealing with customers at a service retail center. He was young, maybe 22, and I thought I'd treat him with kid gloves because I don't like to make a scene or cause issues, but I was still so surprised at how easily he was able to tell me he didn't want to deal with my issue. n nProblem 2 A week later, the screen comes in. I bring my phone in and they tell me to come back in a few hours. I do. The screen is on. I leave, thinking all is good. Over the next 48 hours, the digitizer goes wonkier and wonkier and slowly recognizes less of my swiping and dialing, and I am unable to use the phone to do anything but fill my pants pocket. n nI call in, explain the situation after sharing with the person the exact issues. He says it could be a faulty digitizer and they could order another one. I ask if they can expedite it, he says they can but I'll have to pay extra. I inform them that they have not actually fixed my phone and are under original obligation to do so. This clerk turns out to have learned his customer service skills from his colleague, the first one I spoke to. He said I had to pay extra if they had to expedite any process. I ask for the manager and am transferred to a young man who identifies himself as such and also tells me he is the one who personally worked on my phone. I ask him if the information about extra costs for expedited service is true and he confirms it. But he does say that he will personally look at my phone to see what's up. n nI hung up frustrated and we agreed I'd bring the phone in for him to assess. n nProblem 3 The next day, on my planned day to bring it back in, I wake up and my phone has now become a black screen, the wonkiness having been complete. I become very concerned that they have now killed my phone with a bad screen install, but am happy when I hear a preset alarm go off and the phone recognizes my standard downward swipe to shut it off. n nI bring it in and explain the situation to the manager I spoke to, the guy who said he personally worked on my phone I am not naming him so as to personally shame him . I tell him I was able to hear my alarm and thus deduce that the phone itself is fine, but the original repair might have some loose connections. He says fine, we'll look at it. n nI call back in a few hours, and he says, yes, we were able to fix it. He tells me the tech he was supervising who fixed my phone did not reconnect things securely. I don't remind him that he told me the previous day that he was the one who actually did the work. No biggie, I thought, at least my phone is fixed. n nI go to pick it up and he hands it back to me. I run through the phone and it all looks good. n nThen, as I'm about to walk out, he says, ""Oh, and I wasn't able to get the loudspeaker to work. I tried to fix it like three times and it isn't coming up. "" n nI tell him it was working that morning, which he knows, and ask him how exactly I am supposed to hear the phone ring? He shrugs his shoulders and goes back to dealing with another customer. I walk out, stunned. n nNowhere along the line was I offered a discount for the shoddy service, an apology, or even the slightest sympathy that they had been the ones responsible. The franchise owner needs to either send his children tech clerks to some customer service training or expect that he is going to get a lot more reviews like mine. n nWorst. Service. Ever.",1

"I've been here several times with my kid. We only get the fried rice, so I can't say much on the variety of the food or the quality of anything other than the rice, but most of the time it's spot on, exactly as advertised, good ol' fried rice. Once it's been slightly undercooked, so it was just a tad crunchy in the middle of the rice grains, but that only happened one time, so maybe it was an off day. n nA tip If you order chicken fried rice, you'll get a LOT of chicken, so if that's what you're looking for, basically a 1 to 1 ratio of chicken to rice, this is the place to go. n nThe service is.spotty.

She's looked and behaved that way every time we've come in, and it's kind of off putting, but she's never been outright rude, so at least there's that. n nI'm giving 4 stars because, despite the occasional lack in social graces, this place is clean, fast, reasonably priced, close by, and the food is tasty or, at least, the one thing I've eaten here is tasty .",2
"Doors were supposed to open at 2. They opened two doors at 2 40 and a mad rush ensued. We waited in absolute chaos outside only to finally get in at 3 15. We then had to run to our seats through more crowded chaos only to have to wait again to enter where our seats were. Thinking it was their fault everyone was not there on time we thought for sure the show would be delayed right? Nope, they started at 3 23. Not nearly everyone was in yet and they turned off the lights. Poor all around. From what I understand this is normal there. We won't be going back.",1
"Shawarma is great, falal was just okay. Overall was a good place to get a quick bite.",2
"Back in LV for biz, after 3 days on my feet at the convention center, I headed away from the strip to Asia town for foot rubbin action. nI had stumbled across a place last time, but couldn't remeber the name my fellow Yelpers had highly rated this place, so I ventured in. nMichelle was nice was firm on my sore muscles but not torturing. nShe has strong little hands! My only request would be to use more lotion next time or something that doesn't dry so fast as some some arm rubbin might have sparked a fire from my dry skin. nI did like the semi private room a few chairs in each room as other places I have been to have 6 chairs in a front lobby area, not as relaxing if people are in out of the front door. nThanks Michelle, I will be back when in town!",2
"As a connoisseur of sushi throughout the world, I was blown away by the quality, presentation and over the top taste that I experienced at this restaurant. The artistic presentation of the sushi was the best I have seen anywhere as this is an art, not a science. I cannot recommend this restaurant more strongly and look forward to returning on my next trip back to Las Vegas.",2
"Wasn't impressed. I ordered a half rack, and mac as my side. The ribs looked good, and it was a healthy portion, but they just didn't have anything special going on. Served dry, and I don't think they spent much time in the slow cooker. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard fare, and served in an awkward glass bottle that made for difficult pouring. nThe mac and cheese was bland, very disappointing. And a side tortilla was an odd addition for a rib plate. n nIt was very clean, the staff was friendly. I wanted to like the place, but the flavor just wasn't there. I kind of felt like I was at El Pollo Loco. n nFor the plate and a Bud Light, I spent 20. For a few bucks more I could have gone up the road to the sit down bbq chain and had a much better meal, with bold sides and corn bread. With the handful of other BBQ places in town running stiff competition with some real authentic down home skills, these guys are going to have to step it way up in the flavor department if they want to keep up.",1
"Went for brunch yesterday and while the food wasn't bad the service was TERRIBLE. Had to wait 30 minutes just to get waters, we watched the waiter serve every table but ours, asked twice for water and he forgot, as well as the mimosas that were ordered. Food was alright, although our order was messed up, however instead of doing anything about it by that point it was easier to simply eat it and not complain as we couldnt wait another hour for our mistake to be corrected. At times we felt bad as it was only one waiter for all of the tables. We did ask the person brining our food for water, but he simply walked back inside. The manager didn't seem to be helping much as he was busy on his phone most of the time. n nThe location is nice, but I was so upset by the service it ruined it. If you want to be upmarket, or trendy, or even have wine on offer, perhaps the staff should offer it, or at the very least say hello to the guests.",1
"Ordered to go. Asked for a small modification on one entree ""can you leave one item out "" , but when we got it, it was not modified. So I just paid 15 for an entree I can't eat. Even if it was made modified, it was very dry. The other entree was just ok. Not worth the cost. I hade Asian food from food carts with better flavor. nCost did not reflect quality. Too bad, since it's close to my house ",1
Place is awesome. Have been there for lunch during the week as well as the weekend. Never lets me down. Probably some of the best pizza I have had.,2
"Dr. Chamberlain is the best! I was originally with another doctor, and I am so happy I ended up with him! Everyone in the office is so friendly and helpful. When you walk in they have music playing and a movie playing for the kids. Such a fun office! Their customer service is amazing. This is by far the BEST orthodontics office I have ever been in. I highly recommend this place!",2
"The store is conveniently located in a shopping plaza for a Kmart. While I waited in line, the staff acknowledged me. Very courteously attended to. There were many people waiting, it was a very busy day but the team was moving around urgently, greeting customers and maintaining their professionalism. n nYou can expect to wait a good hour if you arrive at a time when the entire community decides to show up that same day lol",2
"I had a lot of fun here. We did the day and night tour. Had a little bit of time before it started, so we grabbed the best bloody mary I think I have ever had. n nI am super gullible and super skiddish. So I was glad we did the day tour before going back for the night tour, so I could actually look around and enjoy the bloody sights. For awhile I thought it was actually REAL true. hahaha but that's me being gullible. n nWe returned at night and it was SO creepy! The characters were all very into it. And they could tell I was skiddish and took full advantage of that. n nNot sure if I would do it again, but it was fun, and amusing.",2
"I have been thinking about trying this restaurant for awhile, and when the BF and I couldn't decide on breakfast this morning, I decided it was time to try it. We got there around 10 and it wasn't very busy, we didn't have to wait long and easily got a table. So I wrestled with what to give this place star wise. The lady who owns the restaurant was really nice, she even came by our table and said hello. Additionally, the employees were nice. The food was just meh, not terrible by any means, but not good or memorable in any way.so I had to go with the 2 sorry guys . I had the eggs florentine and, though the eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was not made correctly. It was very acidic and tasted not good, which kind of put a damper on the whole thing as it covered all of the food . The bread was good, but it got soggy quickly which is why I think they traditionally use english muffins . The potatoes were mealy and not crispy at all. I barely ate any of them because they were that meh. The BF got the strawberry pancakes. The pancakes were flavorless.like puffy white bread, but with less flavor. I figure a place is fairly meh when their pancakes are worse than those at Ihop. I even said to the BF that if this place were the only breakfast place in town.I would probably just cook at home. Now, it could have been an off day, and I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I probably would drive out of my way to go here again.",1
"The egg rolls were SO good. I ate a ton of them. Very good! Lovely staff too, very friendly.",2
Let me start by saying I love Bojangles biscuits and chicken. n nThis location of Bojangles is apparently privately owned or somehow not managed by Bojangles. n nThis Bojangles is awful. I stopped by to pick up a sandwich for my brother last week. The chicken appeared to have been cooked days ago. I asked for a packet of mustard and was told it would be .15 cents. REALLY? n nI live close to this Bojangles but I will never go there again. Don't judge Bojangles by this location!,1
"Excellent Pizza! We were vacationing in Arizona for a week and found this place via yelp. What a great find. Oven fresh pizza. I ordered the ""Tirolese "" as the combination of prosciutto and brie is fantastic. However, house rose was just ok.",2
"This was our first and last time at Grotto. We were new to the restaurant so didn't know the menu, the cashier taking the order was not too friendly. There were no seats available on the patio so had to eat inside. The table was located near the bathroom, which was not pleasant at all. Once the food came the experience did not get much better. The eggs tasted microwaved and there was a live inch worm in my sons fruit. Needless to say we do not have very good things to say.",1
"Based on the incredible seared Chilean Sea Bass, this place gets 5 stars! It was simply outstanding. Cooked to perfection and very well balanced flavor. Before I ate here, I had my doubts about a seafood chain restaurant being on this level, but they have won me over! n nNot the quietest dining experience, but the service was also very attentive.",2
"Had high hopes like I said had. Service was good but how many times are you going to bother us and ask how things are? Capreese was tasty so was desert but our main meal was the green lasagna and it tasted like sponge. It was all cheese, noodle and no meat. The best lasagna I have in town is at Brio's . so guess I am spoiled but this really as horrible. Also while I like the idea of siting outside I will never sit against the outside rail again. People walking by with their in your food, really makes for not wanting to eat. nif your looking for good Italian there are much better places in town",1
"I have been coming here since the new owners took it over in May and I will not go any where else.

This picture is from today.",2
Not good. Service was not good. Waiter didn't listen to our order and the pizza sauce was way too sweet. Toasted divinci sandwich was good,1

"I wasn't too impressed. The server was great and the ambience was nice. But I felt like everything we had was just lacking in flavor. We had the Shibuya roll, bland. Lobster Scallops, bland. I'd rather just save my and go to Oyshi haha I gave it a shot and I can say I tried!",1

"We were looking for a new sofa for our living room and everywhere we looked the prices just seemed so outrageous. Found Mitch's website, and went down to their store and found what we were looking for. Talk about getting more bang for your buck.

I completely recommend Nobody Beats Mitch.",2
"A couple months ago my friend and I saw a special on the Wynn Buffet on the food network and were so impressed, we put it on our must do list on our Vegas VaCa. n nWe knew ahead of time, it would be expensive. It was like 40 a person for dinner. And we were prepared to pay. n nThe food was disgusting. We went on a Saturday night so it should have been busy enough for the food to rotate though. Everything I ate was dry and nasty. Like when you leave meat out for a few hours and the top of it crusts over. Or noodles that are half mushy half dried out hard. And the meats at the carving station was extra, extreme rare, borderline raw. n nI really thought there would be more selections. But in all seriousness, it's not at all bigger than your average neighborhood asian buffet. Except it's stretched out in a long line instead of cramped together. Because asian buffets do have american food and pasta and pizza. It's nasty, but it's the same nastiness of this buffet. n nI thought the plates were beautiful. But I don't want to pay 40 dollars to eat on a nice plate. n nOn the upside, we recieved very good service.They were quick, and continually took our plates and refilled our drinks. We were however RIGHT next to their waiting station though. lol. The wait in line was pretty fast too. We probably waited less then 15 minutes. On a busy night at HomeTown Buffet, in the ghetto btw P the wait time can be a freaking hour . n nAlthough our table wasn't that far, most of them were like a maze. I think I would definitely have gotten lost. However, like only a few feet from our table was a giant pile of dirty dishes, near the employee entrance. If I hadn't have been so obsessed with the disappointment of the food, I would have noticed that while I was there. Oh, but we have plenty of pictures with a huge stack of dirty dishes in the background. n nI have to add that the line for crab legs is ridiculously long. It's a good 20 minutes in the line, but what makes it ridiculous is that the crab legs aren't worth it a bit. I got a plate full of it and ended up not eating any of them. I can't put my finger on it. It's too salty, but that's not the problem. I can' only relate it to having a metallic taste of it. I don't know what it is. But I couldn't eat it. n nI don't know why everyone says it's so good. I am very picky. Or maybe I have better taste buds?",1
"A great place for mexican food. First clue is you actually see mexican people eating there and not just in the kitchen working. We love getting the Jimmy fries as an appetizer, I highly recommend them! I usually order the carne asada taco plate. Super delicious, but you have to ask for limes on the side as they don't come with. They serve them with rice, beans and guacamole. All are awesome but the rice. I'm not a big fan of it, there lies their inconsistency. It's under flavored or not cooked all the way through most times. The service varies depending on the waiter. There's a waiter there who can ruin your dining experience with his rudeness and lack of urgency when you request anything. If you get Miguel what an amazing individual on the ball through your entire exprience. Also, if you ever have a party or function where you must bring food I definitely recommend ordering the Botana Platter. They usually only need about 1 hour to make it. It has small portions of their shredded beef tacos, chimichangas, rolled tacos, a bowl of beans in the middle and a huge bag with chips and salsa. So BOMB! Get the hot salsa and mix it with the regular sooooooo freaking good. They also have banquet rooms if you have a big group.",2
Really good with good healthy options! I had the chikichimi which was wonderful! Came with fruit to finish tha job whaaaaaaaaaattttt,2
"BEST sushi in town! Very nice restaurant. The staff are all friendly! Parking deck attached to the place which makes parking no problem at all. I have been to this place during lunch and for dinner. Lunch is a more relaxing atmosphere. At night, especially on the weekends, there is usually a DJ playing music throughout the place. You may want to make reservations for dinner and on the weekends. They also have a patio area to sit outside if the weather permits. Dress code casual dressy n nBest sushi rolls to try 1. SPICY SHRIMP CRAB SALAD ROLL and 2. SUPER CRUNCHY ROLL. Also ask for sushi specials! n nAs far as the other food, it was okay. I've ordered the filet mignon, with fried rice, miso soup, and salad with ginger dressing. The salad and dressing is by far better than Nakatos. The other food I ordered was smaller in portions compared with Nakatos. If you are looking for larger portions and for the cook to prepare food before you, I would try Nakatos. If you would like to order from the menu and GOOD sushi, this is the place for you!",2
Boo hiss your TV dinners are less salty than your food fresh from this restaurant. Used to love Boston Chicken but it's declined too much.,1
Terrible customer service. Cashier got order wrong then had to argue with her to change it from regular burrito to giant caramba. She should've just fixed her mistake. Then she charged me 50 cents to get my horchata without ice. It was bad enough that want a quarter for a soda refill. I'm being nickled and dimed and I don't like it. Won't be going back.,1

Ive seen better stocked Walmart in my time. Ive been to this location a lot do to location and it seems as if i want something there always out of it. anywhere from food to car parts. pretty annoying. staff is friendly though. also there's no tire and lube place here but that's all right,1

"I can not express how disappointed I am in the 27th Avenue MCACC West Facility. I called the MCACC West location after seeing an online post of a pup who looks just like one I have on the euthanasia list. I couldn't let this adorable little pup be euthanized, so I had to take action. I explained to the staff member that I was calling to adopt an animal that was on the euthanasia list and needed to be removed from the list immediately. After being on hold for about 15 minutes another staff member picked up, so I repeated the purpose of my call. She then told me that I needed to call a different number, so I did. The person did not pick up and their voice mail gave specific instructions NOT to leave a voice message in regards to an animal on the euthanaisa list and to call the hotline instead. Great, but no hotline number was given, nor was such number listed on the posting. I called the first number back and got another staff member. I politely explained the purpose of the call and asked if there was someone else I could be directed to and if I could have the hotline number. The women sighed and put me on hold. When she came back she had no numbers to give me and wasn't sure what the hotline number was. Instead she huffed and puffed and said she would take my information over the phone and take the animal off the list. Gee, thanks. I could tell by her whispering with a co worker in the background that she was just eager to go home for the day and didn't want to help me save this animals life. It's truly disppointing that there is not a better process in place for people to help resuce animals by adopting them before they are euthanized the morning. What's even more disappointing is getting a bad attitude by the staff and feeling like you are an inconvenience to them because your trying to save an animals life.",1
"We have been VIP guest for 10 yrs. We are finished with this place. Our comps have dwindled down to nothing . We are big gamblers and didn't win a penny. We rented an umbrella space at the pool.

"And the Herb Box does it again. I knew not to go back after the terrible service, but my girlfriend said she really wanted to try it. So what happens?

"My boyfriend and I just returned from a four day vacation in Las Vegas my first time and his second. We chose the Hard Rock Casino based on a handful of factors, including n Friends' recommendation n Price n Interest in on site shows nIt was an interesting experience, but I wouldn't go back. And here's why. n nThe Good nThe Hard Rock Casino Hotel is made up of three towers, the casino, two clubs event areas Joint and Rogue , bars Skybar, Vanity , and a handful of restaurants Johnny Smalls, Pink Taco, Mr. Lucky's 24 7, Nobu, Rare 120, Ago . There's also an on site tattoo parlor, a couple of 'rock shops', three pools, Reliquary Spa and the RockSpa gym . This means that there are a variety of options to explore and you can if you're interested stay there without needing to leave. n nWe stayed in the Casino tower in a standard room that looked out over the pool, and it was perfectly nice. The art is photographs of rockers in our room, Janice Joplin and Jimi Hendrix , the furniture is very modern, the bed is very soft, and you get four huge kingsized pillows. As mentioned, the blackout shades are fantastic you can definitely ignore the world if you need to. n nThe pools are well designed a combination of a beach spa tropical sort of feel. There is swim up gambling, lots of waitresses to get you drinks from the bar, and the bar itself is really fast perfect to grab a drink and run . NOTE a double jack and coke? 22. n nWe saw a show at the Joint, the event venue, and it was fantastic. They only allow in 4000 people, which means just about anywhere you are, you can see feel hear the band perfectly. n nWe ate at Nobu and at Ago. In both places, the waitstaff were extremely welcoming, friendly, and warm. The food was delicious, especially at Nobu, and we had no trouble moving our reservations around to accommodate our show tickets. n nThe Bad The whole place, other than the rooms, smells like smoke. The ventilation is awful, especially in the hallways walking from tower to towner, or to the restaurants. The inside is kept overly cold even though it was 100 outside, they kept it in the 60s indoors, so it was really hard to go from place to place and be 'dressed right'. You'd think, with the encouragement in Vegas to wear as little as possible, that this wouldn't have been an issue. n nThe lighting in the rooms is awful. Its hard to put on makeup in that lighting. n nGambling is not a priority at the Hard Rock. We'd originally planned to enter one of the morning poker tournaments, but the total number of people participating varied between 3 5 we may as well have played in our room together and saved the money. As a result of the lack of emphasis on gambling, the casino is pretty dead except from midnight 2amish. Which is a drag. n nThere is only one restaurant to get breakfast. The 24 7, which serves diner food. Otherwise, you either get Starbucks and skip it all together. Similarly, if you want something to eat after 10pm on a weekday? Its the 24 7 or nothing. Yes, you can stop by Fuel the convenient store if you want a power bar. But again, the lack of choices is just sort of a bummer when you're looking for a 'vegas experience'. n nDuring the day, its a bit of a drag. Unlike the other casinos e.g. Mandalay Bay, MGM, etc there are no shows or events to do during the week. If you're not out by the pool, then. you're probably passed out. Because seriously, there's nothing. n nFinally, the pool scene is ridiculous. You can't bring any beverages in, even water or your morning iced latte. The first time I realized this, I had to throw out the coffee I'd literally just bought. I get that they want people to buy pool drinks, but that's over the top in my opinion. You also can't bring in bags backpacks, so forget about bringing your iPod to listen to tunes or your Kindle to do a little reading. It'll get lost stolen destroyed. During the week when its less busy , the Rehab pool is closed you can only use the Casino pool, which as a result becomes really crowded. You also can't use the beds white poufs unless you meet the drink spending minimum 100 which means there's perfectly good seating that can't be used. On Saturday and Sunday when the AM SKRAM and Rehab are going , you are searched and have to stand in line to even go out by the pool at all. Its a huge hassle. And the people you're interacting with, 99.9 of the time, are already hammered. People start drinking at 10am when the pool opens and continue all day. So there's no filter. there's no courtesy. Its pretty gross. n nSummary I realize I probably come off as an old person I'm not I'm 30 in this review, but all told, this resort was not for me. Much as I loved Nobu and seeing Coheed at the Joint, I could just as easily have done that and stayed somewhere nicer with more to do. There wasn't anything about staying at the HRH that made me want to come bac",1
"I went here on my 2 year anniversary. The food looks really good, a very extensive menu and full bar. My only issue I got food poisoning that night and threw up. Missed work the next day. I ate crab soup, seaweed ice cream and we split a mixed drink of tropical ingredients so it's hard to identify the culprit. The prices are outrageous and the servings small. The puking makes me want to run back to Kyoto Bowl for good cucumber rolls and better prices.",1

"This is probably the cheapest buffet I've ever been to. Yes, the selections are not as much as other places, but for the price, what are you complaining about. Just like other buffet, there are some good food, and there are some bad food. And from what I remember, this place was not bad at all. If I had gone back three times for more servings of food, then it must be good. So if you want good deal when it comes to food, then this is the place. Just remember to make the best deal out of a buffet, make sure you come hungry.",2
Great food. Service could be better. Terrible managment. Hostess let friends and other go ahead in line when packed. Managment does not strive for good customer service. Had a manager who really didnt seem to care that we had been waiting and got terrible customer service. She sided with employees and made us feel like we were doing something wrong. Terrible.,1
"Me and my brother got scammed into coming in with a ""All You Can Drink "" wristband for 25 each.6 n nDid you know they even water down BEER?!?

"This hotel is probably idea for smokers or people who love the smell of cigarette smoke. If you are sensitive to smells and indoor air quality, stay away. Like, don't even visit the casino or the rides. n nI'm conflicted about this place. On the one hand, it was really, really cheap to stay here for a week, on the Strip, in Vegas, in a room with two queen beds. Check in and check out were painless. They upgraded me from a 6th floor to a 23rd floor room on Sunday. n nHowever, if you go to other hotels on the strip you're going to get major location, fanciness, and smell envy. Yes, smell envy. Let me start there. n nThe casino in the Strat smells like disgusting stale smoke. While there are signs when you get off the elevator saying ""Non smoking floor. "" Why they bother to say that when they clearly don't enforce it is a source of consternation for me. There were even cigarette marks on the toilet seat in my room on the 23rd floor. When patrons come up the elevators to your floor, they also bring an elevator full of gross smoke smell. There are also ashtrays at the entrance to the elevators. ON A NON SMOKING FLOOR. HELLO. n nThe room itself also had terrible air quality. I could smell smoke strongly in the first room I had, not so much in the second. But the second's air conditioner had some sort of janky filter rigged to the AC which was full of dust. Our noses were running the entire time. n nAlso, there seemed to be construction going on above our room. At 7 in the morning. On a Sunday. It sounded like people banging on wood and dropping things. n nI'll update this review as I remember more stuff but overall, if I had to do it again, I'd go with Circus Circus, which is cheaper, bigger, and closer to the action.",1

"What a difference a day makes. Add two or three years and your locavore foraged hipster restaurant Sardine, might just become very different, morphing into an izakaya serving ramen and a variety of Japanese inspired appetizers. I liked the old Sardine concept well enough, but the execution never quite lived up to its promise. This new incarnation, although at first seemingly much simpler, entails a lot of hidden complexity from the rich stock which is made the old school way, to the perfectly pickled kimchi, to the craft tonic that makes for nicely balanced cocktails. And of course, the ""did I just walk into a set design meant to be a hipster bar in Brooklyn "" interior, makes that simple piping hot bowl of ramen, somehow a lot cooler. Regarding the latter, I had it twice the first time it was too salty, but good, and the second time, everything was bang on, from the broth to great noodles, to eggs soaked overnight in vinegar and soy sauce, it was all damn good. I have a feeling they'll just keep getting better. Try it before the lines are around the block.",2
"FAIL. n nI hate to sound harsh in a review but this place was over the top with FAIL today. The failboat had just landed and off loaded a fresh batch of FAIL. n nCustomer service FAIL. I walked in, walked up to the counter. Sole employee in evidence looks over at me, picks up bucket and walks into back room with it. No ""I'll be right with you "" or ""Excuse me I'll be right back. "" Nothing. Comes out with bucket of ice. Dumps bucket into an ice chest. Repeat three times, never a word. n nWhen he did come to the counter and ask what I would like I felt like waiting on a paying customer was the last thing he wanted to be doing right now because he's much to busy for that. There was no one in line behind me, by the way. n nWhile I was waiting I had ample opportunity to read the drink menu front to back. I was delighted to see that they featured a ""signature drink "" iced mocha made with toddy. I was almost giddy to see toddy on a coffeehouse menu. I commented that most coffee places don't even know what toddy is and I was very happy to try the ""signature "" iced mocha. n nSo the guy starts making the ""signature "" iced mocha. Dumps chocolate syrup into cup. Starts steamer to brewing two shots of espresso. ""Excuse me, isn't the iced mocha made with toddy? "" n n ""I'm making yours with espresso.

Went with a large group and had a great time. The staff was totally on top of the service. Food was cooked to perfection and the lamb was some of the best I've eaten.,2
"My wife and I ate here before seeing the Michael Jackson One show. We wanted a nice steak dinner that was located in Mandalay Bay so we wouldn't have to worry about rushing to the show. All and all it was an OK dinner. The service was ok, a bit slow and it seemed like we had to find our server every time we wanted a drink. The complimentary trio fries were delicious, like many have said on here. I ordered the bone in rib eye, cooked medium and it was good. My wife ordered the halibut and she said it was ok. We shared the mac and cheese, which we enjoyed very much. The baked potato was pretty darn tasty. The ahi tuna and hamachi poppers appetizer were yummy. My wife and I both agree that we enjoyed the sides and appetizer more then the main entrees. For drinks, we were also given a digital drink menu via ipad, which I thought was a great idea since drink menu's change so frequently. I ordered a Corona and my wife ordered the Cucumber Martini, which she absolutely loved. I would rate this place at about 3.5 stars, but round up to 4 stars. For a 250 meal, we expected better service and food. I probably would not dine there again, since there are so many other places to eat that offer superior service and food.",2
"We waited almost an hour for lackluster food that barely rivaled Chef Boy Ardee. This place is a shadow of its former self and its origins from Chicago. They've managed to accomplish what other big chains avoided mediocrity. Skip the drama and head to places like The Cheesecake Factory which, while not enlightened, delivers quality food with quality service at reasonable prices. Maggianos Las Vegas just doesn't make the cut. Skip it.",1
"AZ celeb DJ came highly recommended from our venue at Seville golf and country club as their ""preferred DJ "" let me just say we were very excited to have a great DJ for our wedding. Except that was FAR from what we got. It started out rocky after we thought we had an appointment to get things set up, and drove around for over an hour to find out we didn't in fact have an appointment. They rescheduled with us and added in a lighting package for the confusion and we were very pleased. At the meeting we set up majority of our music and the DJ recommended a nice ""anniversary dance. "" The next few weeks we spent a LOT of time picking out the perfect songs for all of the other dances. The day of our wedding finally arrived and the first thing I heard from all of guests was how rude the DJ was. I was told ever since he showed up he had a ""chip on his shoulder "" he played the same few songs over and over, and didn't even do the anniversary dance that HE recommended to us along with any of the other dances we requested. Our guests didn't even know we cut our cake due to the DJ NEVER announcing it. We had no direction of how the night was supposed to go and nor did our guests. He then told us he was about to play the last song for the evening, we didn't realize he wasn't booked for the whole evening so we asked if we could pay him to stay longer. He demanded cash that evening to stay and then acted like we were the biggest burden in the world for PAYING him to stay an extra hour! Apparently if you book a wedding with them on a Sunday you are under par and don't deserve respect or the kind of wedding that you have paid for with this company. I would never wish this apron anyone esp someone who spent over a year planning their perfect wedding. I now have guests who left with a bad taste and memory of our awful DJ who yelled at them at the end of the night for our wedding memories. Thanks for making our special night one to remember and NOT in a good way. Do yourself a favor and find a company who will care about your special occasion.",1
"I would by no means consider myself a tartare expert, but the beef, French style here was delicious. It came served with some great baguette crutons an we ordered fries for the side as well. My gf had a red pepper soup and loved it, hearty, but not heavy as she described it. n nOverall a great lunch stop after walking around st luarant all day. My only complaint is that the tartare portion was actually too big for one person, about half of what was served would have been perfect.",2
"Worst experience ever! I came in to cash a money gram at 8 30 by manager or supervisor KRISTI said id have to come back at 9 bc she didn't know how to do it.So already disappointed I did, I come back to find out they can't even cash it a money gram!

"Food is not good, that's basically it. Atmosphere is kind of dark, not comfortable. Service is not great but not bad.I'd probably give it a 3. Back to the food.it just doesn't taste good, it's prepared in a ton of grease and the presentation is not attractive. I stopped going here although I live close by. If my boyfriend ever wants to go which is almost never except there's not much else in the area so sometimes he gives in, I just sit idly by why he eats because I'd rather go to sleep hungry.",1
"Ah, the place where dreams go to die. I find most casinos in Arizona to be a little depressing, this was no exception. It's pretty small, but they do offer all the games, including tables, bingo and late night bingo parties and keno and it's easily accessible, so it will do on occasion, when I can handle all the smoke for a few hours.",1
"Horrible! We were looking for a good place for Chinese food, this was not it. The orange chicken was like an everlasting gobstopper. You could not stop chewing it, it never broke down. The Pork fried rice had chunks of refried and refried pork, like flavorless wood chips. The egg flour soup was a gelatinous yellow substance with no taste. The chicken lo mein had a nice burnt taste to it. The egg rolls had been cooked, cooked and boiled again. My family stood around our Chinese bounty, each trying our food and spitting it in the sink. We then had to go out and get a real dinner. Don't stop here you will be sorry",1
"I found egg shell in my fried rice, need I say more? To sum it up, I will not return. The food is very bland, and not well prepared. Don't waste your time or money",1
"I was visiting Charlotte this past week and asked the hotel to recommend a locally owned place for breakfast. Parkway House was where I was sent. It was about 10am in the middle of the week. The seating was open. Service was prompt and friendly. The food was good, filling and cheap. I would definitely go back.",2
"This is the best Steak house I've been to in Charlotte. Excellent food, amazing wine list, and great service.",2
Great and cheap spot for a quick lunch. Lunch menu is worth stopping by and have a short sit down.,2
"ZERO STARS! Okay let me start by saying it looked promising when we walked in this afternoon for lunch, but later found that this truly was the worst place in Las Vegas as other comments have mentioned. We arrived at noon and there were only three table with two people at each. FORTY MINUTES WENT BY BEFORE WE LEFT BECAUSE THE SERVER NEVER CAME OUT. There were three or four workers plus a lady manager. I had spoke with her once about the not receiving any service at all in a completely empty restaurant. nThey would receive ZERO STARS. The LVH should be embarrassed to house this establishment in there facility! Have a good week and stay clear of this turd. It needs new management as well as every server. We even tried to speak with the manager regarding having no service and did not care. She stood in the dining room the entire time gossiping with her staff within our visual sight. Please do us a favor and close the doors for good to the Burger Bistro. n nTJ Steak house on the other hand is a 5 5 and worth the money!",1
"Most authentic mexican in Madison. Amazing food. The tamales Mexicanos are homemade and filled with chicken and jalape u00f1o. The chorizo tacos were the best tacos we've eaten.ever! Their guacamole is super fresh. When we ordered a soda, it came in a can. It definitely wasn't enough to quench my thirst, especially with the spicy tamales. A couple people were eating the menudo. I haven't been able to pull the trigger on that yet but, if I was going to try it, this would be the place. Maybe I'll get the courage next time.",2
"I have been practicing Bikram yoga for the past three years. My first Bikram yoga class was actually taught by Bikram himself I have been hooked ever since. I usually go to the studios located on the west side of town and I was excited to try the new location because it is closer to my home. First, I must say the place is beautiful and the carpet is the best out of all of the Vegas Bikram yoga studios. This location has the best locker room, too. I don't like how the mirror is on the opposite side of the window to the parking lot, it is distracting and too bright. I would suggest a darker tint on the windows in the studio. And now for the big negative which will cause me to never come to this location again. From what I understand and what I was told by Bikram, the room while practicing Bikram yoga should be at about 105 107 degrees with 40 humidity. Every time I went to this location I felt the room temperature was not monitored at all. It was way too hot, so hot my feet burned when they were on the carpet! My last visit, half the room sat out more than half of the class time and I almost passed out, which has NEVER happened to me. I heard mutterings from other yogis on how it was way too hot, as well. People ran out of their water and the teacher would leave and get a water for them and then tell the receptionist who it was for so they could charge them for it. So I decided to look at the temperature to see how hot the room was and it said 122 degrees! I was shocked and very upset about this! That is way beyond what the temp should be, it was no wonder I almost fainted. I strongly urge the instructors of this studio to please monitor and adjust the temperature. For now, I will not be coming back here and I even have some classes left to use that I already paid for. It is not worth it to use them because I'd rather go to do yoga, not to become overexposed to extreme heat.",1
"Humble Lion is a solidly good cafe, filling a niche in an otherwise rather dreary stretch of Sherbrooke. I'm always surprised that the neighborhood immediately surrounding McGill is so desolate, but whenever I think I'll need to schlep myself east, west, or south a good haul at least 5 minutes walking! as if! to find caffeine and hipster baked good sustenance, I remember Humble Lion. n nThe coffee is good, if tending toward sour, and the baked goods are reliably tasty. The ambiance is great if you need a bright place to sit and work, but seating is often in high demand, and be sure to bring headphones every time I'm here, my attention is averted from whatever I should be doing onto the loud conversations between the baristas and the owner or their coffee drinking friends. The bathrooms are not friendly for anyone with the slightest mobility impairment or claustrophobia , but there are power outlets galore, and free wifi. All told, a good if not quite exceptional cafe exactly where one needs a good cafe to be.",2
"There were a couple of applause worthy moments, but otherwise, in a word.BLECH. n nWe ordered VIP seats which are pretty nice in that they're right up in front of the ice, but as soon as we sat down, we detected the very strong stench of mold. So that was our initiation. The venue itself is old, old school vegas lounge which has huge kitsch value. n nThe show itself just felt very foreign from beginning to end, foreign in that the humor, choreography and dancers' personalities just seemed so bizarre. I feel like this must have been choreographed by some old Russian guy about 3 decades ago. For example, a woman started doing a bunch of hula hoops. At one point, she had about 10 going at the same time from knee to neck, which was pretty cool. But then someone came out and dumped about 30 hula hoops on her. After a huge heave ho, she hoists them all up to simultaneously swing them around about 2 full rotations. Then she dropped them, looking to the audience for applause, as if that was supposed to impress us. I wanted to jump up and say to her ""sometimes, less is more honey. "" n nThe acrobatic scenes had these painfully long pauses before one person would jump on a seesaw to have the other fly up in the air. They kept doing basically the same move over and over again with a 10 second pause before the little flip. 30 years ago this may have captivated audiences, but in today's hyperspeed media world, it doesn't cut it. n nThe curtain call was also strange. After each soloist came out and took their little individual bows, the curtain went down suddenly and all the lights went out. Everybody was desperate to leave, but after some awkward moments in the dark, the curtain and lights come back up 30 seconds later and they all skate up slowly to take a bow. Strange given that they'd already pretty much taken their bow. n nThe humor sections were just painful, not funny at all, and the actors doing the humor were so cheesy. The skaters were for the most part joyless, not enjoying their time there and clearly watching the clock. They could have upped the kitsch factor by making this a topless show, but let's face it, that would just make this show a different kind of tragic. n nThe best thing about this show is that it is only an hour long. We pretty much sprinted out as soon as it ended. n nWe got these tix for half price, but still overpaid. I would value this show at around 15 person. Can I suggest you pay the premium to go see one of the Cirque shows?",1
"Well, this was definitely the worst meal I had on vacation. We ordered the texican chicken salad lettuce, fried chicken, cilantro, onion, tomato, black beans, tortilla strips corn with chipotle ranch dressing and the fried pickles. The salad was bland and the lackluster dressing hardly added anything to it. In stark contrast, the fried pickles were SO salty, I couldn't finish them. Seriously, this may have been the saltiest food I've ever had. If the U.S. suddenly institutes a draft and you need to evade it, grab an order of these for a severe spike in your blood pressure. Otherwise, there is no reason to order these. We did have some pretty good local beer I tried the Noda Jam Session, which was a pale ale with strong hops and a pretty cool hipstery can. Beer aside, I left here a sad daddy. n n Admittedly I am no one's father, but I was still sad.",1

"Not what I expected. Food was good, but nothing special. Portions seemed small. I really did not expect the stand in line to place your order, go find a seat and wait for someone to bring your food, and then you never get spoken to again. Reminds me of McDonalds. We got Thai Dynamite, which sounds spicy, but was bland, and sesame chicken, which was so so. nWhile we were there, we saw someone spill a large amount of salt or sugar on the floor right by a door. Saw a server going out the door about fall, and then 4 employees walk by it before it got cleaned up around 5 10 minutes later. Lawsuit waiting to happen. nDon't think we'll go back ",1

"Our good friends were really talking up Winghart's, so my husband and I checked it out with them tonight! Sadly, between terrible rush hour traffic in downtown and frigid temperatures, we were a little grumpy when we arrived. However, a beer well, cider for me quickly brightened our spirits. n nI expected the interior to be a little larger and was surprised to see two separate rooms on two different floors. Most of both floors is taken up by a large bar with several tables in the back of both spaces. The tables are seat yourself, which also surprised me. I'm not sure how that would work on a busy Friday or Saturday night. Our waitress was nice and relatively attentive until the end of our meal, when she apologized for being a bit more hectic around 7pm . n nI ordered the Hula Burger, which was delicious! The bun was soft, and the meat was juicy. The BBQ sauce added a punch of flavor, while the pineapple provided the perfect fruity sweetness. I would definitely order this burger again. and again. The only con was that it was a little messy!",2

"Just dont go. This place sucks. I went when I was very intoxicated the first time and the food was blah. Went totally sober for a good breakfast and the food was even worse. The fist time i got chicken fingers and fries, the chicken fingers were o k but the worst was that they had NO sauces for the fingers.except this runny bbq sauce that was utterly disgusting. When we went for breakfast on our last day it was just so bad. I ordered your typical eggs, toast,sausage. I only got 2 small sausages, weak ass scrambled eggs and some shotty fruit. the only good part was the toast that was buttered with jam lol. Our breakfast server was awesome though but the food just sucks so hard, no wonder why they arent in toronto anymore. lol",1
"I am a sometime crafter, but my retired mom is a full time quilting machine she does baby quilts for hospitals and she rarely gets out and about past her small area of comfort when driving, so taking her to Jo Ann's was a real treat for both of us. n nThe store, formerly an office supply store, located in the shopping center at the corner of South and 485 Target, Kohl's, Bed Bath and Beyond, etc. is clean, well lit and has plenty of parking directly in front of the building. It's not in the main group of retails stores, but kind of off to the left, somewhat behind Value City Furniture. n nThe fabric selection is wonderful. Charms, fat quarters, yardage, I was amazed at the selection. Once you pick and choose what you need, just bring it to the table to be cut and coded and you're good to go. I found the staff to be quite helpful. The sell Viking machines there and mom busied herself talking with the woman working on that section and dreaming of a giant embroidery machine. n nThey had a good selection of beads and such for jewelry making, although in looking through it, I think I like Michaels better for that although that could be because I am accustomed to go to Michaels for that and know the products and placement better there. I felt a little lost at Jo Ann's and didn't really see anything that tickled my fancy. But, I was looking for quilting fabric, so I may not have been in the mood. n nGreat store to get lost in if you are a crafty sort or even if you aren't. Great selection of arts, crafts and fabrics.",2
"After waiting in line for about 30 minutes no big deal , and having about 6 groups of people pulled out of line because they knew someone working there annoying , we finally got in and were met by some of the worst bartenders I've ever experienced. We waited patiently for someone, it was saturday night and the place was packed, and one of the girls actually stopped serving drinks and spent the next 5 minutes dancing with the other bartender, leaving no drinks coming out while about 10 of us waited. Couldn't get a jack and coke right, first one was all coke, 2nd was all jack, gave up on a third attempt and just had a beer. I will say the place was loud amd rockin', and that's why we went there. Excellent atmosphere, and a big crowd if thats what you're into, but we came to drink and that was a disappointment.",1

"Went there for lunch today and had to walk out. Waitress had major problems understanding and speaking English. She was not familiar with the menu either. I asked her what the soup of the day was and she didn't have a clue. She went to check and came back to say they were making the soup.but it would not be ready. Mind you, we walked in at 11 45 am.wouldn't a diner make sure they had soup ready for their lunch crowd?! By the way.we were the ONLY diners in the entire restaurant. I asked the waitress if they made their salad dressings in house and she said no. We then turned in our order and regretted it instantly. We didn't feel our waitress even took down what we asked for. She was nice but obviously unsure of herself. We asked her to cancel the order left. The place smelled really funky! Music would have helped the big, empty, eerily silent restaurant.",1
The food at this restaurant is incredible. A must try for anyone that enjoys Greek food. The staff is delightful as well.,2

"After an amazing day at The Spa at Mandarin Oriental, we were starving and didn't want anything too outrageous for a late lunch. We ended up here at the suggestion of one of the employees in the mall. n nIn all fairness, the low rating is based solely on service, so in context, let me say that we arrived around 3pm on a Tuesday and were one of three parties seated in the bar area. Perhaps it was their intent that one person be served and complete eating their meal before the second person was served in order to facilitate socializing, but we would have been much happier being served at the same time. n nThe green tea brewed too long before it was served, and it was quite bitter. Refills on water and other beverages were hard to come by. Miso soup and Bento box were served at the same time with no real explanation for the delay or the inability to serve the soup first, as is customary. n nOn the upside? The food tasted great! And I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I hadn't felt so guilty eating while my companion waited for their food. The manager did end up taking 35 off the bill. nice gesture, but not close to the cost of the one meal that came out so late.",1

"after shopping at the costco next door for 8 years we finally decided to try out arriba. what a stupid idea. it was 8 30 so it wasn't crowded. when we sat down we immediately asked for water and nobody brought it. when the server came we asked her for water but she had chips with her. 5 minutes later someone else brought it and we were even more thirsty. did i mention that it wasn't crowded? right when we walked in they sat us down. after the water came and we downed it she finally came to take our order. we ordered and i noticed that they have their own microbrew beer so i asked for a sample of one of them before i ordered a 22 ouncer. food came pretty quickly but there were only two place settings and she didn't bring me the beer sample i had to remind her. she brought the settings but no sample. she brought the sample and left. when we were most of the way through our dinner she came to ask if i liked the beer? who cares? i'm not ordering one now anyway! i will say that the food was good but this is about the whole experience. when she finally came to ask if we wanted a desert we asked for stuffed sopapillas and she left. then our kids changed their mind so i told them to go find her. they were gone for 5 minutes and came back to tell us that they couldn't find her. they left again and couldn't find her so came back. then she came back to tell us that they were out of sopapillas! cool, so we order what the kids want and she leaves. 5 minutes later she comes back and tells us again that they are out of sopapillas and we look at her and say ""yeah, that's why we want the other thing. "" she brings it another 5 minutes later and finally brings us our bill. i put my card on it, we wait, the kids get restless and the family decide to go wait outside. only then did she come take my card to pay. way to make a good first and last impression. n nWe are never ever ever, going back to Arriba. nYou go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me. nWe are never ever ever, going back to Arriba",1

"Sadly, another style over substance restaurant in downtown Madison. n nMy husband and I went on a Saturday morning around 10 30 am. It was busy, but we expected that given the day and time. We were told that once we ordered, it would take about 40 minutes to get our food, which seemed excessive, but we decided to give it a go. n nWe ordered at the counter and managed to snag a table. It was extremely loud and difficult to carry on a conversation not ideal when facing a 40 minute wait time on the food. I watched a lot of servers wandering around with drinks or plates in their hands, desperately searching for the correct table, and it seemed like maybe this place is a little too busy crowded for the order at the counter format. n nFood finally arrived. Husband got the Cajun biscuits and gravy, which he really liked. I got the breakfast scramble, which was good but nothing special, and was a bit cool as if it had been sitting for a while. The sourdough bread was standard. The cheesy grits were bland. Prices felt a bit high for the amount and quality of the food. n nOverall, it's meh. Certainly not terrible. Nothing that made me want to run screaming for the hills. But definitely nothing special, and no real reason to go back. There are way better breakfast places in Madison.",1
"This place is very misleading I spent 2 hours there. explained I could either get my tooth pulled or have a root canal. I chose root canal and paid almost 500.

"Food was great, Service not so great. n nHad to eat in the bar as they did not have any tables available due to reservations supposedly. However, the tables still were nowhere near full when we left. Waitress was lost half of the time and so I just gave another one my card to pay the tab. Looked at the receipt later when I got home and realized the prices in the menu were different than the prices on the receipt. n nThis is basically my fault for not checking but at the same time if the waitress was not so busy I would not felt like it was going to take forever to get the bill and get out of here and just gave them my card. n nI ate here once before and it was great but on Saturday it was less then great. I am mixed about whether I will return. The service is much better at Houston's and I have never had to wait for a table or eat at the bar no matter how busy they are. n nI should mention that the food was excellent though. n nThe bill came to 100 with tip for dinner for two n nMight recommend others to try it but make sure you check your bill unlike me.

"Alexander's Steakhouse is by far the most interesting eating you can get by the mall area. In the middle of the restaurant is a large charcoal grill surrounded by seasonings and buckets of what claims to be butter. Basically your pick out a steak and cook it yourself alongside potatoes and good old texas toast, dousing on the butter as you go. No, this is not health food. They have a variety of different steak cuts, as well as some chicken and pork selections. It's a rowdy crowd and expect lots of drinking around the grill and I had my doubts about sanitation with all the drunken butter use. If you want a backyard grill experiences in the dead of winter, this place is great, but it's very pricey, loud, and I found out the hard way about charges for sharing 7! .",1

"I've known about this place for a lil while because of my good friend Sara we tried to go there once and unfortunately found that is was closed. n nWell finally went back today and it was one of the loveliest places i've ever been in the city. The Plateau has many gems and this is definitely one that stands out. The Cafe is in a little building well a house converted into a cafe ! n nThe decoration is a mix of vintage eclectic style Tr u00e8s a mon go u00fbt ! There are many different sitting areas and all the way in the back , theres a magical garden yes magical! filled with green vegetations, trees and even a little pond. A place where in the summer time of course you could spend all your mornings afternoons evenings all day, errrydayyy just reading a book, enjoying nature or delighting in philosophical convo's about life. That little magical place even lits up at night to resemble a fairy's den or what i imagine a fairy's den would look like if it existed. n nUnfortunately we didn't eat any meals there only a drink and some ice cream. I had an iced coffee late with a hint of mint which i asked for and my friend had vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and fruits. We thoroughly enjoyed our drink and food and shall go back to sample the main meals and or entrees. n n Bonus This place sells books for 3 which, being a book lover pretty much sealed the deal for me of course i purchased a book by Albert Camus only that one because i didn't have any more change than 3 . Last little amazing surprise , My friend stumbled upon a game of psychology, where you get to ask random behavioural questions the type that answer to 'what would you do if' .

"I feel like I've been all over with my reviews for this place, but don't worry, this may be the last update. My last experience at Ticoz was awful. It seems like as soon as Lola Tapas closed, everything went completely downhill. The happy hour went way up used to be 2 sangria on Tuesdays now 3.50 , they hired a new staff, service became crap during busy hours, they altered their menu to cheapen it up like Kat S said, there used to be 3 salsas that came with freshly fried chips.now, there is one crappy salsa that, last time I visited, came with cold, stale chips and to top things off, their sangrias lack the greatness in flavor and quality that I once saw in them. n nIt really sucks to regularly go somewhere and watch it crumble. Ticoz initially ticked me off, but then won me over for the longest time. I recommended people go there and have a great experience and sangria , but like any roller coaster relationship, the highs and lows are beginning to take their toll on me, and I know I need to just let go. I may wind up at Ticoz if a friend of mine wants to go, but I won't be leading the pack there anytime soon. sadface",1

"Heard about this place from a friend. For AJ to have such a treasure is a real treat. Food is excellent, with use of local ingredients. Extensive beer and wine list that will take awhile to get through them all. Small place with music starting around 7ish this was on a Friday .

I like Pepin's .a favorite of me and my boyfriend. His family is form Argentina and the food is very good.

"I used to live in San Diego and have pretty high standards for Mexican food. I loved Taquer u00eda Guadalajara, but sadly, it isn't an option any more. I am also a vegetarian, which I have found to be a challenge for several Madison Mexican restaurants. However, I was really happy to find Cancun! The chips were warm and the servers were very nice and the food was good! I had a taco salad and when I said no meat, they offered fajita veggies! My boyfriend got a quesadilla, which he said was really good. It was pretty empty in there for a Saturday night, so I hope more people start trying it out.",2

"just a quick update nnot to go into too much detail but I've never had so much trouble with a school than I do with this one registration. every. single. semester. I'm an out of state student but I know I cant be the 1st. ever? nNobody can help me and I have to go from line to line to line. waiting up to an hour in each. just to be told they dont know and I should be in ""abc "" line instead.

In addition, a copy of your Drivers License, DMV tags registration, Voter's Registration and W 2. n nHonestly I can understand all that being necessary if I was a Show room new student .but I'm not.

I was also told by a different line that they would take in state fees by putting a note in the system that my app was pending.

"Regarding the Living Social deal Old World had been hit hard due to various festivals so they were lacking a lot of stock, so even though we had a Living Social deal, we could not take home a six pack of the lighter beer. Instead we could get a voucher, a four pack of dark beer or root beer, or some pints, so be prepared for that. nThe tour itself was a bit of anti marketing aside from detailing the process, the guy spoke of being forced into the delapitated building with a leaky roof, making me feel uneasy about the big roofless water tank, which is cleaned 95 pure making me think of the other 5 . The tour itself can be held in one spot. My brother in law cut his leg on a hand truck he didn't see. It could use more positive spin and interaction. For example. I suggest giving each person a plastic shot glass of grain to eat rather than using a potentially germy communal bowl and a shot glass of hops to rub together and smell, that sort of thing. The bottling equipment looked cool, but it would have been a lot cooler if it was turned on. The POSITIVES the people are awesome, the flights are refrigerated. n nRegarding the location it looks a little like a radiator shop on the outside, but inside it has a wide open clubhouse feel with a bar, music stage, and some bar games. My wife felt it could have been more modern, but I liked the clubhouse feel, like someone using their garage to entertain people. n nTalked to one of the owners, a genuine and enthusiastic guy with sparkly eyes, tongue bar he looked a little like the Chili Peppers drummer. He let us try some ice cream made with the porter. I think they should make them porter available for tasting during the tour although it was nice to have that special treat to ourselves and that they should sell the ice cream and etter promote their community events their BBQ cookoff looked fun . n nAnyway, I recommend the place.",2

"This is our 2nd time ordering here. Paid almost 80 for a 3 layer, 1 4 size chocolate with strawberry in the middle, they diced the strawberry into VERY small pieces that you'll kinda wonder ""is this a strawberry? "". They probably used like 3 whole strawberry for the entire cake. I specifically ask that they do not use any other color besides pink dark and light , white and black because that's our theme, i even called to make sure because it was not written in our order but they still put leaves green on the flowers. If you look at the photo I posted here, right in the middle there was a mistake in the pink piping which makes you think ""how come they did not clean or fix it?! "" It was right in the middle! When I called them about the theme color they email me the notes they added and I saw that they also wrote there n "" customer is aware that black icing stains that not much may be used. "" nBut there was more black scrolls at the sides than the pink! So when we cut it, we just scraped the sides. But the worst part is the hand writing, I even complain about that and they said we could re write it if you want because different decorator has different handwriting, so I said ok, so we waited and when she showed it to us it was almost the same as the 1st one just a very tiny difference when ordering cakes in a famous bakery vs Smiths' or Albertson you have this very high expectations that they would be able to make the hand writing message in a very professional and very nice one. It did not stand out! They should make the writing bigger and bolder! And when we ordered, the rep couldn't even show us sample pictures so we could have an idea what the cake would look like, she showed us pics from the website which we already saw If we only knew that our cake will turn out this way we should have just ordered it in Smiths it would be a lot cheaper and we wouldn't have expected a lot! The taste is good but it was just ordinary. Would we recommend? Not sure, I've tasted good cakes ordered here but i guess the quality is not always the same, keep your fingers crossed when ordering so you'll get a better one! will I order again. Not anymore! Lesson learned! Good luck to whoever is ordering!",1

"I went to this store and ordered over 31 in chicken and sides to take home. When we got home, we discovered that the extra biscuits that I paid extra for, were not included in the bag. We ate the rest of the meal, and near the end of the meal, my daughter bit into her chicken strip, felt something hard, and pulled a small stud earring out of her mouth. I went back to the restaurant a few minutes later and explained the situation to the person at the counter. She said that I needed to talk to her "" coach "" I could not understand what she was saying, and asked her to repeat herself a couple of times. I still could not figure out what kind of ""coach "" she was talking about. I asked to speak to her manager and was told her ""coach "" was the manager and that I would need to call her after 8pm because she was busy. I reminded the person behind the counter that I too was busy and did not like having to come down to the store again because an earring from someone's body was found in my food. n nI contacted the ""coach "" after 8PM and was told that she would open a claim into the incident. I asked for a refund for our food and the woman told me that she would not give me my money back. She said that I would have to return all the food back to the store. I told her the rest of the meal was eaten by my family and asked which end she wanted it out of! She said that she would give me a store credit for the biscuits that were missing from my order. So, the only restitution for finding a foreign object in the food is a store credit to go back and eat their food again. n nI contacted the Health District. I have also been in contact with the insurance company regarding the investigation.

"My third visit to the MGM Grand was fatally bad. I will not return. They did not have the 2 queen bed room we booked, and ""upgraded "" us to a room with one king and a rollaway. That sucked. Flashback to slow lines at check in, and flash forward to three calls to housekeeping to get the rollaway. And they didn't bring pillows or sheets. Huh? The room was filthy and in dis repair. Think Monica Lewinsky's dress when I describe the filthy couch. Think The Who circa 1970 when I describe the walls. Plus so much dust everywhere that I'm sneezing just writing this review. My take is that the MGM Grand is such a huge hotel, that with staff cutbacks, is not being maintained properly. So, what goes on in Vegas, gets reported on Yelp.",1
"MGM bought them out, and now they are terrible. Management is great, but powerless. Nothing was good, except the Red Wine and Scotch. Too Bad.

"Where to begin? n nLike many people out there, I was looking for the perfect engagement ring for my fiance. I went to many of the jewelry stores inside the local mall. The different sales people that I interacted with we're all very polite and helpful but I honestly felt like after I explain to them what I was looking for they picked it up and ran with the best way to pad their commission check. I understand a lot of jewelry stores pay their employees on commission, so I don't fault them for that. I do however fault them for the broken promises of not calling me back when tbey said they would. I just felt very uneasy every time I left one of the stores and I was very happy that I did not go through and make the purchase with one of the other companies before I went to Shane Co. n nI knew what my fiance was looking for in style and color. I checked out the Shane Co website, and yes I found her perfect ring! YAY ME! I went into the Scottsdale location with just a downloaded picture from the website and a item number. The first sales rep that I dealt with had told me that the ring was not available at that location but that he would have it shipped in by the end of the week. Sure enough I had a phone call within 3 or 4 business days as I was promised that the ring was in the store. You know what they say in that song "" life is what happens when you are busy making other plans "". Life happened I never forgot about that ring. It honestly had been about two and a half months since I made it back to the store. I went in there on Monday April 21, 2014 and the sales lady Laura had told me that the ring may have just been shipped out. I was fully prepared to start all over again trying to find the ""next "" one perfect ring for my fiance. She had told me she may have thought it was still in the back room. She returned about 5 mins later with the ring in her hand. She then asked the standard questions, what kind of center diamond what I like? What is the price range that I was willing to spend that kind of thing. I had told her that I wanted to spend 3,000 4,000 max. She then showed me the type of center stone that I was looking for, and a size that was well within my budget. after about a half hour, which went by incredibly fast, I had my fiance's perfect ring all ordered and ready to go. n nI have to recommend anybody who may be looking for that one perfect ring for their fiance, or any type of jewelry to put Shane Co. at the top of the list. The way I was treated made me feel like I was somebody special when in reality I am not. I had just gone into the store after running some errands, and I fully did not plan on going into any type of jewelry store. I was wearing sandals cargo shorts a t shirt in an old ratty sun bleached Sun Devil hat. They didn't treat me any differently then if I had gone into the store where in a brand new Armani suit. I cannot say enough great things about my entire experience from start to finish with every single person that works at the Scottsdale Shane Co n nGuys do yourself a huge favor, and as you search the internet, much like I did, looking for that perfect engagement ring wedding set, when it comes time to actually go into a store, make sure your first stop is your local Shane Co. I can not promise you will find that one perfect ring, but at least give them a shot. n nI will be going back for many years to come. If I could I would rate Shane Co higher then five stars. Yelp, you need to see about changing that. I will so give it the highest rating possible n nAddition To My Review n nI keep odd hours, and my schedule and traditional business hours rarely mesh. I had some follow up questions so I went to the Shaneco.com site. I left a message in the general voice mail box. As before, I had a very prompt return call the very next day. For better or worse, my call came across the desk of a VERY HELPFUL employee named Angela. Through a series of phone tag and voice messages, she answered every single question. She is another fine example of the extremely high caliber of employees that Shane Co. have on staff. Just like earlier in my review, anyone who is out there looking for some great quality jewelry, and very reasonable prices, head into your local Shane Co. location, and at the very least, see what they can do to help with whatever you are looking for. Hopefully you will not be disappointed, I can honesty say that I am not. They genuinely have a very loyal customer for life. n nGood luck to you in your searches for that perfect piece of jewelry.",2
"We went to Blue Hound with a group of friends who come together to have a great meal and amazing company. n nThe ambiance of the place is very cool. The furniture, decor and lighting were all extremely well done. The bar area was packed and people were enjoying their drinks and some light appetizers. The down side in design and construction is that nothing was created to buffer the sound. I get it, it is Friday night in a trendy restaurant, but the acoustics were an assault on my ears and prevented my friends and I from having any conversations unless we were almost yelling at each other. n nWe began the meal with drinks and appetizers which were good. We had tater tots, caramel corn and deviled eggs. The tots were very good, I really enjoyed the flavor and the accompanying dipping sauce. The caramel corn was ok, but the spice was a little overwhelming to the point where it was not balancing the sweet. at times I couldnt event really appreciate any of the sweetness. Lastly the deviled eggs were. well deviled eggs and not as impressive as the deviled eggs I have had at Chelsea's Kitchen. n nI am glad our waiter recommended the short ribs with the blue cheese grits, it was probably the single best dish on their entire menu, the rest seemed. eh. The short rib was absolutely killer, it had a sasperilla glaze on it that was amazing and the meat just fell off of the bone. I was really happy with my choice as apposed to my dinner mates, probably to their annoyance because I was making a lot of sounds as I engulfed my dish. n nMy wife had macaroni and cheese in the smallest bowl I have ever seen. I get it, macaroni and cheese can be extremely rich, but it still is macaroni and cheese and you are charging 12 for it, so show me a little love. Again, I have had better at the chain the Yardhouse with truffle oil and it is all that and more. for about the same price. n nI did not have dessert, but that is because nothing excited me on the dessert menu and in the back of my head I was thinking I would stop by Churn on the way home for some ice cream and home made caramel sauce that did not happen, but I thought about it. a lot . n nTrying not to sound like a broken record, but service makes or kills a business and I was not impressed by our waiter. I know we had some challenges with a few of the dishes and at the end of the meal he acted annoyed with us when sorting out the checks. I don't care how large the group is an what mandatory gratuity is imposed on me on the bill, but I was almost to the point of having that gratuity taken off because of how annoyed our waiter was acting with the group. Again, I get it, large group, lots of tickets, but to act that annoyed was not called for. n nIt was brought to my attention that this restaurant made the 10 best new places to eat in Phoenix by Phoenix Magazine and I really take issue with their judgement. Phoenix Magazine assigning that type of status to this restaurant really calls into question their credibility as a publication. Maybe they were dazzled by the trendy atmosphere, but I am more about substance than style and Blue Hound does not meet any criteria of being considered the best of anything. Blue Hound is not the worst place I have ever been to, but it is one of the most mediocre places I have been to. I find Phoenix Magazine calling this place one of the 10 new best of places to be offensive to the efforts of other area restaurants much more deserving of that designation. n nOverall I was glad that we gave it a go, but it is not a place that I would go out of my way to go again. My dish was really good. REALLY good. but if I went again I would wonder what else I might try and from what I saw I don't know if I would be that interested in any of the other offerings.",1
"My husband is a professional Bass player and he gets everything he needs from Sam Ash. Today, we traveled 2 hours from Asheville NC to come here. We like this place! Decent customer service and they are willing to match prices!",2
So glad we found this great breakfast spot before leaving Las Vegas. The food was great and the service was excellent. Thanks Amanda,2
"I did not think it was possible to have Chinese delivery this bad. Every last offering was just the worst it could be. The rice was old and dry. The chicken greasy and. off I will not go so far as to say spoiled, but I would like to . The beef dishes couldn't be eaten because they were tough, dry, and. um. leathery, yea that's it. beef flavored leather. nI only ordered from this restaurant because they pinned a flyer to my door advertising the establishment as ""New York Style Chinese Take Out "", and if the meal that I received is what people in New York get for Chinese take out I really feel bad for them.",1
"Quickie Service is whack. Frozen hot chocolate tastes like a slightly better version of a Wendy's Frosty perhaps this is because it felt like a thousand degrees in Vegas. . n nThree of my friends and I decided to stop by to try the famous frozen hot chocolate on a late Sunday afternoon. I scoped the place out and saw at more than a dozen empty tables. Sweet, the wait was going to be nonexistent.NOT. The wait turned out to be 35 40 minutes. Why they refuse to seat people when they have plenty of open tables is beyond me! I asked the snooty hostess why this was so and she said that it was the top of the hour so they had to seat everyone who was already on the list.that didn't even make sense. If there are open tables, shouldn't you seat guests? The hostesses proceeded to seat two other groups before us in a span of 20 minutes.really?! n nWhen we were finally shown to one of the many open tables we took a quick glance at the menu and chose the sliders and a regular frozen hot chocolate for two. We closed our menus and waited for our waitress to come around, which probably seemed longer than it actually was due to the heat. She unpleasantly took our order then came out 5 minutes later and abruptly placed dishes on our table without saying a word to us. She must hate her job. n nThe sliders were decent and again, the frozen hot chocolate tasted like a frosty. I definitely was not worth 12. n nIf I ever come back I will make a reservation and only to try the other appetizers omelettes.",1
well the drive was worth it .i got this crazy burger with fried egg on it.sounds weird.but it was amazing along with sweet potato fries it was a meal i had to go to the gym after.,2

"Horrible experience! First off the menu is extremely limited, so if you like options . Not your place to go. Everything is really unorganized. Waiters are frantically walking back and forth you can't even enjoy the view. Our experience was terrible because our soup was cold, main course ordered came 1 hour later and the waiter was probably the worst part. When I was going to order I asked the waiter what he recommended and he was really rude and short about it. Some loser French guy who hates his life. After our food took too long we asked what's taking so long he first said ""want to cancel "" then said 3 minutes which turned into 15. Of course we canceled and left. But the point is it was like he enjoyed it. As we left I saw the manger standing around I told him what had taken place. His reaction was a half ass apology. Don't waste your time and money in a restaurant that is going to give you horrible service. vegas is full of amazing places . I'm surprised this place remains open. We were at stk night before . Fabulous. Don't go here . View is half ass. Service is terrible and food is limited.",1

"What the heezy happened in this joint? I walked into Le Thai pumped for Penang last night but I walked out of Le Thai me Is Money shaking my head. n nAfter slinging back some cocktails at the Mob Bar with a few home fries, we trekked over to Le Thai for a pad thai party. We were sat right away on the covered patio outside, at which we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. What's a girl gotta do to get some agua around here when she's dehydrated from the drinking? Wait, I guess. Our server later came around to take drink orders, and while the same people who complained about the cold opted for ICED Thai tea, I asked for a glass of hot water. The teas came by, but lo and behold, no water is this because we're having conservation issues? No matter I waved down a busser who came by right away with the missing goods. n nOur roster consisted of Thai style wings, Thai beef noodle soup, Penang curry with brown rice, tom yum soup, and short rib fried rice. The food was actually really good, which was enhanced by the cold weather and my declining buzz. Plus, the soup was so perfect in the cold, until we realized that was it we were sitting IN THE COLD, and only 1 of the 3 heat lamps were on. We asked a staff member if we could turn on the extra heat lamps, and we were shut down, being told that heat lamps actually weren't even really allowed, given the cover on the patio and all. As we watched the last of the heat lamps die out though, he refilled the lamp as if to do us a favor. n nThe curry came out with white rice which was frustrating if it hadn't been for another employee who pitched in yet again, but it wasn't anything compared to the irritation we harbored when we went to pay the check and were told they could only make four transactions total after we had calculated the payment for six people. One of us opted to pay with cash, and the change was rounded up because they did not carry change I'm not sure if this was just the server, or the restaurant as a whole, but either way, it doesn't seem to make much business CENTS. n nI've never had much of an issue with the food here, but the service is just such a hit or miss ALL THE TIME, with it being more of a miss lately. I feel like I'm throwing the place under the bus, but I suppose this is the same disappointment my parents felt when I told them I wasn't going to be pre med, and they've managed to move on.",1
"In thirty years of taking shirts to the laundry I have NEVER been charged for the shits being extra large. Just moved to the area and was the first time I tryed this cleaner, had a coupon stating 1.89 per shirt. When I came to pick up the shirts 33 shirts I was charged NOT the coupon price of 1.89 but 2.30 a shirt when I asked about the price I was told that the extra charge was for extra large shirts. When I said I have never been charge for the size of the shits, he was rude and very short with me. After taking the shirts out to my car I came back in and asked for the name of the owner since I was going to file a complaint. He said he was the owner and handed me his business card and walked away. What a way to treat a new customer, very rude, very rude. As others have said in the reviews for this cleaner, go somewhere else this is a very rude uncoporative and untruthful company that has no sign anywhere in the store that states additional cost for larger sizes. Nor was I told the coupon price was not good on my shirts when I brought them in to be cleaned. The attorney general should check into this business and their business practices.",1

"Who says that you have to stay at an actual hotel casino when in Vegas?! The Jockey Club really was a find, so I had to give props to my friend for booking a room the week of our trip. n nSome of you who are like me and have never heard of The Jockey Club before, it's basically a building of private condos located right near the Bellagio and across from Paris a great location on the strip! . n nFor two nights, our private condo was around 200, so 100 a night. Our room came with a bedroom, living room dining table included , a kitchen, and TWO bathrooms. The bedroom had two queen size beds and the living room had a pull out which was perfect for our party of 6. The only complaint that I had was that our pull out was not only extremely uncomfortable, but it was broken as well. Needless to say, my friends seemed very comfortable on the actual beds yes, I got the pull out . n nSo here are the pros and cons of The Jockey Club n nPros n Cheaper than most hotels n Private pool that is open 24 hours n Air conditioning thankfully, since it's the middle of July n Every room has its own kitchen with working refrigerator and freezer n Two toilets! which is a must for parties of 6 or more n nCons n No casino downstairs n No room service n Not as luxurious as a stay in let's say, the Venetian. n nYou can weigh out the pros and cons for yourself, but if none of the cons are exactly deal breakers for you they sure aren't for me , then I would definitely recommend Las Vegas go ers to try this place.",2

I have never been disappointed with anything I have had here.the big and little ass burritos are great. I have also had the chimichanga, tamales, and street tacos. All were very good. My only complaint was the service this time. extremely slow at lunch time. I understand lunch rush. believe me I do. but you can't leave your table sitting for so long without coming by. It took forever for anyone to initially come to our table and then she just disappeared. It was kind of hot out and we were on the patio baking away.

"Not my cup of tea. I've done bikram yoga before, and while I almost despise it, I'll try not to let my bias get in the way of this review. For those who aren't aware, bikram yoga is typically done in 90 minute sessions in 104 degrees with 40 humidity. That's enough to make people sweat, or worse yet, faint before even entering. But if that's what you want and you are aware, there's no reason why a bikram yoga place can't get 5 stars. So here's why I'm giving 2. If people feel dehydrated or suffocated, they shouldn't be pushed to stay. It is not only unsafe but stupid. There should be fair warning for what the class will entail prior to the session for those less knowledgeable. Then, as aforementioned, during the session there should be more awareness for health and safety. People should be reminded to stay hydrated and to take a break if they are uncomfortable. The yoga instructor said ""if you are feeling dizzy like you want to faint or throw up, don't worry, it's normal! "" Uh no. That's not normal. No where in human medicine is the feeling of wanting to faint or vomit normal. And patrons should be informed of this. If you want to get water, GET IT. If you want to leave, LEAVE. If you need to stop, STOP. Don't force yourself to do something totally and completely unnecessary. I was a first timer here and I stayed in the room for the full 90 minutes and attempted did every single pose. I was complimented profusely. Those who left in the middle or had to rest were considered weak. That's not right. Just because I stayed doesn't give me more merit, and someone who had the wits to leave when they weren't feeling good shouldn't be mocked. I have had instructors that push you to a certain extent, and don't condone what is unsafe. That's why this place gets 2 stars in my book. n nAnd now for my bias. If I want a good workout or a good sweating session, there are far better activities that come to mind. 'Nuff said.",1
"CONSISTENTLY VERY GOOD. Where chain food can be shaky with the quality and consistency, you have NOTHING to worry about here! They have a small outdoor seating area so if you can snag a table that faces into Uptown the views are great. Why bother eating at Dresslers their neighbor when you can eat here for half the price. This restaurant is casual so you can just stop in for some beers. I've been several times and had the burger, wings, pretzels, and cedar plank salmon extra well done please. Seriously, you can't kill it enough . All items were excellent. My guests have had the salads, rib eye, filet and they enjoyed every bite. There is a menu item called 'bucket of boat trash' for 29. It's some kind of seafood mix. For 29 I would never order anything with the word trash in it. I'm sure it's tongue in cheek, but the Hickory Tavern marketing execs may want to rethink this one. n nMy only gripe about this place is the parking in the Metropolitan. It's not Hickory Taverns fault. Every time I park there everyone has road rage trying to squeeze in a space. You get frustrated and anxious and end up parking on the 5th floor just to wait for an elevator and end up being late for dinner.

We both had girls that we hadn't met before. n nI went first and she rushed me into the back room. n nFirst let me start by saying that when I get an eyebrow wax I expect it to take about 10 15 minutes. I've had at least 50 eyebrow waxes She spent a grand total of maybe 2 minutes on my eyebrows. All she did was wax them! She didn't trim them or tweeze them AT ALL. And trust me, they needed it! n nWhat was even worse was she spent the entire 2 minutes trying to upsell me to get other services. She said AND I QUOTE ""Oh you need a facial you have a big pimple! "". HOW RUDE. As if I would stay and endure another minute of her criticism. Then she asked me if I was getting a lip wax as well. I was so offended. My upper lip is NOT hairy and certainly doesn't need a 15 wax. n nMy friend had the same experience. They spent almost no time on her eyebrows and just tried to get her to do other services while we were there. n nI can usually go about 4 6 weeks between eyebrow waxes. But this time I will need another within 2 weeks. n nI will not be going back to this salon.",1
"We passed by this place about a month ago when we were shopping at The Forum. I thought this was just a chocolate shop dessert place. After taking a closer look at their menu displayed in the front, we discovered they serve food too! Finally ate here a few days ago. n nI loved the layout of this restaurant, it really felt like sitting in a chocolate factory! There were big jars on the walls filled with pieces of chocolate, crates on the floor filled with cocoa beans, pipes on the ceiling with flowing chocolate, etc. n nMy husband and I came in for a light lunch. We ordered n nMax's Pizza Meaty, Crispy, Cheesy More not really a fan of thin pizzas, but this was great! Very tasty, can't go wrong with pepperoni and bacon, which are my two favorite pizza toppings! I also liked how they cut it into bite sized pieces. n nSouthwestern Caesar Salad with Chicken individual size I know this sounds boring, but this was THE BEST Caesar Salad I have ever eaten! Good quality lettuce, good grilled chicken, all the ingredients were cut small so it was easy to eat. Very tasty and loved the creamy Mexican Caesar dressing too! n nPure Chocolate Truffle Granita they were giving out samples of this in the mall, we both liked it. It was thick, not overly sweet and came in a neat ""Alice Cup "" with a metal straw. n nService was okay. We didn't wait too long for our food. The waitress didn't seem too excited about her job though, maybe she was having a bad day? But she did take time to explain things on the menu and checked up on us a few times. n nI will definitely come back again to try their other drinks and desserts! The Chocolate Surprise Tiramisu sounds good. The waffle fries with chili and cocoa powder sound interesting too.",2
"Located off Hayden just S of Costco and N of Raintree Rd on the East side of the road. The parking lot is a little scary but there is a decent amount of parking. I called and ordered Pho soup for pickup and they said it would be ready 5 10 mins. When I arrived it was being wrapped up in the back. The man at the desk was very nice. They do delivery through a delivery company but they charge by distance I believe. nThe inside was very cute. The pictures make it look a lot fancier than it is, but most Vietnamese places are hole in the walls, so this was definitely a step up from that. nWhen I got the soup home it was still warm. Not hot or cold which was great. I added everything into the broth and the basil aroma just filled my kitchen. They did include a fork, spoon and chop sticks which was great. The flavors were all there but it definitely could have had some more basil, noodles and sprouts personally. I don't hold this against them though because delivery is always a little different than on location. nI will definitely be returning! The price was great and the menu had plenty to chose from! They have been around since 2005 and definitely deserve to stay around!",2

"We had our first appointment with Paradise today. We arrived 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork and watched the waiting room fill up with patients, then watched them all go in ahead of us. We had our three year old and our 14 month old with us and despite checking in with the front desk multiple times, we ended up waiting for over 75 minutes to be escorted to the room, then waited another 15 20 for the doctor to come in. By this time, both kids were getting really bored and our little guy was crying as he was due for his nap, which is why we set the appointment time early in the first place. n nWhen Dr. Kertz FINALLY came into the room, she told us that she'd just been sitting at her desk eating a snack and had no idea that we were waiting! She was nice and competent, but her nurse then bungled the shot my daughter needed and scratched her arm with the needle. It was a pretty crappy visit and I don't think we'll be back to see if they can improve the next time.",1
"My all time favorite airline has reached an all time low. They are five months into a pathetically inept transition to a new sabre based reservations system, and still can't handle elementary transactions on line. Meanwhile, call center hold times are nearly an hour today. My whole family flew Virgin for this vacation on my recommendation I cannot begin to tell you how embarrassed I am, or how deeply I regret the recommendation. Fly another airline, take the train, drive, walk . or just stay home. But whatever you do, don't go near Virgin America until you hear reliable reports that they've sorted this mess out. No vacation is worth the amount of stress, anguish and hassle we've been through.",1
