"It's Best Buy. everyone is familiar with it, so I won't go into detail about the product line and such. n nThis review is strictly for the customer service. One word HORRIBLE! Every since time I've come to this location, I've had a problem. n nI purchased a part for my car stereo, went to get it installed and it turns out all the pieces were mismatched. They gave me a hassle when I tried to return the item 20 minutes later. n nIn short, avoid. The one on Rainbow is awesome.",1
"Went over to Brick and Barrel after dinner at Rock Bottom one night. Although it was a Tuesday night, this place was definitely questionable. It seems like maybe a cool spot to start at, grab a quick beer and then continue on with your night. You definitely don't want to make plans to spend quality time here, or invest in a night on the town here. Grab a beer, enjoy it, but then keep it moving, preferably before you need to use the bathroom.",1
"This was my first last time going here. I went there around 9 30 they close at 10 Not only did they seem upset my daughter and I came in they managed to mess up everything on the order to where they had to make it again. They were to busy chatting with their friends at the table behind me while I was ordering. The store was disgusting and near the soda machine you couldn't even set your cup down to put a lid on it, as the whole counter was wet with who knows what! Stay away from this location!",1
"I thought that I scored a deal when I booked one night at Excalibur for 45 but it was a wake up for me when my hotel had a view of a brick wall and when I asked for another room I was told that I would need to pay more. When I check out I was told that I would need to pay 15 service fee which made me even more angry. I did checked in earlier and the parking was free, free wi fi but no refrigerator in the room. It was fine for one night but I will not stay there again.",1
"I have been going to this dentist for several years, but after numerous problems with the support staff, I have finally given up on them. The Dentists are very good, but the administrative staff and management are incompetent. The last straw was when they changed my appointment and didn't notify me of the change. Then they had the nerve to ""scold "" me for not confirming my reservation, that I did NOT make.",1
"Wow. Probably one of the worst breakfasts I've had in my whole life. The biscuits and gravy are like eating warm glue. The potatoes are tasteless. I'd give it a half star if I could and that would just be for the friendly staff. Definitely several steps down from Dennys. I guess if you're over 85 like everyone else here eating, it's just food. Do yourself a favor and keep driving. I expected much more from a mom and pop place.",1
"It wasn't the food selection for me. Very little to choose from on menu even when it came to big. I wasn't a fan of ""A giant piece of bacon. "" The girl and I will not go back because of the menu selection. I don't mind pig but the menu didn't offer much to my girl's or my tastes. n nPRO Has Mercenary IPA and other great drinks to choose from! n Great Service and interesting atmosphere nCON Menu did not fit me even though I would eat a pig.",1
"Upon first entering the establishment my boyfriend and I noticed it had a rather run down interior that probably wouldn't meet health code with the visible water damage on the ceiling. The only thing to keep us company aside from Asian pop music videos was the sweltering heat! We got our food to go, only to find out that most of it was too fatty to be edible. Needless to say 45 dollars later we were left with greasy fingers and empty tummies! Never going back!",1
"Aw man! I had such high hopes for this show nYeah, not impressed, which sucks because he seems like such a nice fellow. He did his famous impersonations of George W, Clinton, Charles Barkley.etc. But it didn't seem like the show was that put together just yet, considering it opened about 3 weeks ago. There's a band who performs through out the show, yeah, not feelin' them either. nScale of 1 10, 10 being the best.I would give it a 6 n nLocated inside the Monte Carlo in the Lance Burton theater.",1
"Nothing compared to O'Hare. This place was busy, but that's no excuse not to be clean. I used two of the nastiest bathrooms I've ever seen while waiting on my flight my husband said the men's bathroom was equally bad . n nAnd what kind of an airport doesn't have a McDonald's?!? Everything was WAAAAY over priced food wise, 11 for a cold cut prepackaged sandwich! . Give me a break! n nWon't be flying through here again unless I don't have another option.",1
"If you found this place in Southern California, it would probably sit idly like every Lollicup, Quickly, or TapEx. n nI miss the sea salt coffee from 85 Degrees. nI miss the amazing fruit in your drink selection from Tastea. nI miss the self pour tea from Ten Ren's Tea Station. nI miss the honey boba from Half Half. n nIf you're craving innovative drinks, you won't find it here. But at least this place suffices for the most basic boba milk tea until I get to go home again",1
"Luckily we came here on a groupon so we only paid half price. The burgers are nasty tasting! Even my husband, who is not as picky, thinks they were gross. Maybe I am used to chemical and hormone laden beef? Perhaps, but usually when I eat organic dairy and produce it taste better than their conventional counterparts. Not so with this beef. n nThe shakes were yummy and the fries so so. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.",1
"It had nice clean sheets and the mattress was plastic wrapped . Positives nThe smokey smell is pretty bad . nVery old fashioned , like a step back in time . nUnique place . Not really my normal place I would stay , but the price is so low it's almost unheard of . Also the cafe had very low prices for big portions. nJust know that you will not be getting the Ritz but I don't think the Ritz charges 45.00",1
We will never return. Our appointment was in 10 minutes and a lady walked in 15 minutes after us and was told there was only one provider and the wait is one hour to an hour and a half and she was taken in 15 minutes. We walked out and the front desk said the reason there was a wait was because of walk ins and urgent appointments. Not cool. Was told this place was amazing and I will never return or recommend.,1
"At one point in my life I played in a band, a full time traveling band. We've stayed in some of the shadiest places in town, and this would qualify. Let's put it this way, I slept with clothes on because I didn't want to touch the sheets. So, why did I stay here? Because it was a business trip, and I really had no choice. n nOn the plus side, it's within walking distance 2 minutes of the EXPO center.",1
"The buffet was great but the manager Malinda was rude when she kicked us out. She said ""Hi I'm Malinda and I'm the manager here. We are closed now so it's time to get going. "" My friend was so disappointed that I had to write this. We would expect more courtesy in a professional manner. At least a 5 minute warning. I would give it average 3 stars for this but put 1 for the managers attention. But our waiter man was great!",1
"I bought a groupon today and drove 20 miles to give the place a try, I was really excited about trying out the place. When I pulled out my groupon I was VERY RUDELY told they were not going to accept it. He said they were not going to take groupons until Monday? I tore up the groupon and threw it on the counter and told him I would never be back. Having some kind of issue with taking the groupon is one thing, being extremely rude about it is another. I will spend my money somewhere else!",1
"The apartments look nice, but they are poorly constructed at least mine is . I can hear literally every step my upstairs neighbors take. I can hear it through the ceiling and even the walls sometimes creek vibrate from just their walking. It's incredibly annoying. I have lived in many apartments some for less expensive and i've never heard my neighbor so clearly. I've also had issues with cable and internet. Im very disappointed in this unit.",1
"just had a carne asade burro for lunch with guac, sour cream, and pico. wasnt anything speiclal at all. I prefer my burro's to not be cut in half considering its a burrito not a PB J. n nThe salsas didnt have a lot of flavor. The hot salsa had a good heat to it but just not much flavor. I found myself using the green salsa the most. n n nOn the upside i had an ice cold Victoria that made up for it all. I would go back and try the fish tacos i suppose",1
Went here for a smog and had a coupon for an Economy Buster Special 17.99. Take the truck there and it's a Chevy 2500. The attendant refuses to take the coupon stating this is a heavy duty vehicle and the coupon doesn't apply. There are no disclaimers on the coupon! n nI called another Smog Buster and was told the coupon should have been accepted without any question. n nDo not go to this Smog Busters.they are a joke!,1
"I went to Beef jerky store a couple of weeks ago. It's a pretty much a bare bones store where they re sell jerkys, repackage and re sell nuts, dried fruits, seeds, candies. Nothing special at all. It was not worth my trip to downtown. There is a great store a couple of blocks away though, at the container park. I wish I knew about it before, just got a bunch of jerky from them for stocking stuffers.",1
This location is the worst Chipotle I've been to. I place online orders often and they are very rarely ready on time. Today I arrived 15 minutes AFTER the pick up time I chose and it still wasn't ready. They also forgot part of my order. I only ever order steak and when I go to this location my bowl is almost always full of fatty steak pieces. Very much looking forward to the location at 27th Ave and Deer Valley opening soon.,1
"I thought the food was only ok. I have been t Papadeaux's in Houston,Dallas and Austin and the food was great! n nWe were hungry for Cajun food and even though the restaurant was 30 miles away,my wife and I gave it a try . n nThe gumbo was as far from the real thing as I have ever tasted. It wasn't awful,it just wasn't gumbo. nThe Shrimp Po Boy was ok and they were generous with the amount of shrimp but nI wouldn't drive 30 miles to go there again.",1
"It's Olive Garden, you should expect it to be the same as always. However, I always get the Eggplant Parmesan, and this time it was really bad. I told the waiter and to my surprise the manager came over and was genuinely interested in why I didn't like it this time since I always order it. She comped my meal since I didn't eat it. However, I left full since I did enjoy an appetizer, salad and breadsticks!",1
"We had a big lunch and just wanted some appetizers. I think the menu got a little longer since last time I went to Chili's. It was a cold night so everyone ordered the Chicken Enchilada Soup. This soup way too salty for my taste. Apps were the typical bar food. The service was really lacking that night. There are so many nicer restaurants around this area. I usually enjoy Chili's restaurant, but this one was at the bottom of my list.",1
"Lunch buffet is 7.99. They had rice, beans, chile relleno, pork onions, chimichanga, enchilada, salad, cantaloupe, brownie, white chocolate frosted brownie. Chips come only with ok salsa. Hubbie had 8.95 burrito mexicano instead of the buffet. No a c but has fans which were not on. Husb pulled on chain to start fan which made it more tolerable but in 105 degree weather, we were going to leave d t the uncomfortable level I keep my house at 82 degrees so I can tolerate heat no problem ",1
"This is the worst service I have received in all Las Vegas restaurants. The server walked away in the middle of taking food order. Initially, she refused to take food order and ask us to share food with others whom we met for the first time! She refused to give us check instead she asked the us to finished all the food. It was the worst experience. The bathroom was extremely filthy. Vomit and booboo gaga all over the place. I would give a 5 5 rating if given the option.",1
"The first time I went there is was a 5 star experience. Every time after that the stars just kept falling off. They stopped the scallops , shrimp, marinated beef, and replaced them with three kinds of tasteless fish, two super tough, chewy beef, and turkey, really?, what, no stuffing? Grrr, I will call before next time, no seafood, no go! Another bad experience and I will put my free bowl on ebay where everyone gets rid of their junk.",1
"Very disgusting. This place wouldn't be the first place I would go to if I want to eat some pho. In fact, I would never go here again. I can tell they were reusing the bean sprouts, lime and basil. The bean sprouts had some hot sauce on it from the previous customer they gave it to. I also asked them for scissors to cut my child's noodle. They didn't even take the time to wash out the scissors. Very disgusting. I find it very lazy and unprofessional.",1
"This year was horrible no info on website , very confusing . They said a shuttle was offered and nobody had any idea about it . I saw people lined up at 2 gates that never opened because nobody knew what side the entrance was on . They posted on face book at 2 45 pm come see jabbawockeez at 3 00 pm at 2 59 they said it was cancelled . Red dragon is obviously only interested in making money not in customer service . We are so disappointed .",1
"I ordered a 1 Grilled Pork based on reviews here and the milky eye guy said it was most popular. It measures 7 "" compared with 9 "" elsewhere. They are pretty light on vegetables and do not use cucumbers. The pork was decent, maybe next time I'll have them add pate. n nI took the advice of another Yelper and did a little shopping at Vons while they made the sandwich so I don't know how long it took to prepare. n nI like the banh mi at Hue Thai better although more expensive.",1
"horrible service. the place isn't even ready for a soft opening. the employees have no idea what they're doing. and there's this mean manager lady that's bossing everyone around training the employees on the job, in front of the customers. you know, i was all hyped thinking this would be something similar to the lee's sandwiches in the bay area not even close. 2 stars cuz i like bahn mi. i'm gonna look elsewhere for them.",1
"Uh no. Sorry. I tried this place, upon Dana V's recommendation and I'm subletting from her too! , but it just didn't do it for me. I've had pasties in England not the OTHER kinds of pasties, you sicko , and they were well seasoned, juicy, and comforting. Teddywedgers was not like those at all. n nThick, lard y bland crust. Meat needs more flavoring tasted too much like cheap ground beef to me. Some worcestershire sauce, garlic, I dunno, SOMETHING.",1
"Tried to give this little place to evolve into a great neighborhood joint. Instead it raised its prices within the first month on mediocre food. A couple months later it still is serving Spring rolls stuffed with brown rice not veggies, bad Pad Thai that was too lemony to eat and tasteless chicken. The decor is nearly as bad as the food. When in the area I will dine at one of the neighboring restaurants.",1
"10 of us went to dinner and 80 of our meals were cooked perfectly. Only food, which was overcooked was my Porterhouse and my buddy's Strip n nOtherwise meal was fine. Nothing special though. n nCheese factor Some Disney style photographer came in and shot a photo of us. Then came back 45 minutes later to sell us the photo. Really, really Jean George. You tried to sell us some crappy photo at a 1,500 meal. n nYou went from somewhat classy to super cheezey.",1
"While I love the stuff here, I will think twice about shopping here in the future. I am a foster mom to 4 children, and when I asked them if they would consider giving a discount to foster families, and in return, we would promote their business, they flat out said NO. Too bad, their competition Perrenials adn Kid to Kid give these discounts to foster and military families. Guess where all my shopping will be going forward !",1
"For the price, I'd rather stay at the Venetian, Bellagio, Wynn.etc. Nothing special about the place. It's nice, but like the rating. ""Meh. I've experienced better. "" It's generally clean, and pretty technologically advanced except for one odd thing. The iPod iPhone connectors were for really old iPods, not even for the iPhone. So it was pretty useless. Anywho, nice place, probably similar to the size of the rooms in Paris, Luxor, or Planet Hollywood.",1
Came here for Lunch. Had a reservation. We were seated at the Patio. nWater waiter was very friendly. Our waitress was n t really friendly. nBread was good. nWe both had the brie. Was Cold and Not so good. nBoth had Steaks with redwine. We ordered Medium. Was med rare. nFries were ok. Nothing Special. nSpinach to garlic flawored. nDon't Kiss anybody after this. nView was amaizing. nService Not good. We got spinach 5 min before the Steaks. nI think its to expensive.,1
"Went for a kids haircut, sign says 11.00 dollars, the non smiling, unfriendly lady that cut my grandsons hair say 14.00 after all was done and said, I told her the signs say 11.00 dollars, she says that's the sign for outside, inside say 14.00 wth? I told her that's false advertising! She was not a very pleasant person , my grandson tells me after shes done that the clippers really hurt him.never will we go there again!",1
"OMG, almost got into a physical fight with a woman here. The line for check in was REALLY long, mind you we were an hour early. Some flights were delayed and 30 minutes before take off, the line did not get any shorter. So workers decided to let people ""cut "" whoevers flight was taking off first. This is understandable, because it would be worst if we missed our flight but they handled it the wrong way. n nThis was ""sprit "" airlines btw.",1
"This is not that great of a place. It's very upscale but the folks behind the sushi bar don't really seem to know what they are doing. It took forever to get a beer and a sake here. The worst part was the sashimi yellowtail. It looked like it was purple on the edges. If you want to play it safe and get a tuna roll, it will be safeway quality but nothing too special. This place is more about atmosphere and where to eat if you have a glittery scottsdale shirt you need to show off.",1
Ok i love bowling. And my friends. Wanted to go so i had never been at this place i like it till i went to the bar the first lady was nice. Then i went again and the second. Bartender. Was super. Rude i was talking to someone and asking him why did they close the lil food area and she went off on me she event went to go get the cook so he could tell me. . but she was really. Rude cause i wasn't. Event talking to her and ill never go there again the customer. Services. Suck ,1
"Oh dear, how awful! 13 dollars for a wrap type of Pannini sandwich, cold fries and not very good Sweet potato chips that they swear are homemade. Hmmmmmm! I came home to food poisoning and I have a flight to catch tomorrow. I did like the Jalapeno dipping sauce but what's the point if there is no good food to dip in it? The servers were very nice, and the televisions with sports were a plenty if that's your thing but the food was terrible.",1
"I give this place zero stars. I went in for a pedicure and not only did I wait for about 10 minutes with my feet in the water for the girl to finish eating her lunch, she cut the hell out of my cuticle. It took over 15 minutes to stop the bleeding and then when I asked to be comped for it, all they have me was 2 off. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone, even my worst enemy. I know I will never be back here.",1
"This place is a farce,you get told min spend u00a3150 then get charged u00a3170 ,then get told I will bring your complimentary drinks to you but don,t tell you it's only the mixers that are complimentary the bottle of vodka they bring you costs u00a3140 ,so beware of the way they word things to you,if you go for the absolute vodka that will set you back u00a3110 so very expensive night .These prices totally ruined our night .",1
"Smoked meat is not bbq! In NC, if it ain't pork it's not bbq. Granted I know that Charlotte isn't really NC or in the South culturally. I had the Boston Butt sandwich. It was really nothing special, and I could make it myself. The meal was 10 for a sandwich side and tea, so I think that's a little pricey for the quality. The side mashed sweet potatoes were ok, and the hush puppies were also okay. I may go back to try some other items on the menu, but over all I just wasn't impressed.",1
"This company is all about the upsale. For 60, 'the special' you get really wet carpets for 3 5 hours, but not really clean. The techs are polite, but apply constant pressure for the deep cleaning. The paperwork requires you to sign a waiver for the demo of the deep clean, which was provided to me to sign 20 minutes after the demo occurred. Very shady and we will not let them in the house again. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!",1
I have gone to Dr Basu for years and she is a great doctor but her staff needs to all be replaced. I have waited many times 1 to 3 hours to be seen. My most recent experience is as follows n nI just got turned away at your front desk after driving 50 min to your office. Claiming I needed 30 minutes to fill out 4 pieces of paper. I am a returning patient and will never come back again. They claimed they called me today to be there early. I never got a call. How disappointing!,1
"This company is great. Their FAQ's state that they don't even have to meet you before they marry you. So if you're a male tattooed divorced ex con who is currently living with your pregnant girlfriend. This is the place for you. They'll welcome you with open arms. n n Unless you're a gay or lesbian person. Regardless if you're in a committed relationship and both are law abiding, tax paying citizens who have never been previously married. That's against their religion.",1
"Decent breakfast, terrible ownership. I've eaten here a few times and there is always some 'issue' with the owners myself or neighbouring tables This morning it was about false advertising of 'coffee included'. A group near me argued they were charged for coffee when the sign outside clearly says it's included. The owner proceeded to say she can do anything she wants and that they were cheap. GREAT customer service. Too bad. This place could be good. Too much drama to be coming back here.",1
"This is a quick and easy version of their sister restaurant PF Changs. Place your order. Dishes are broken down with your choice of meats or tofu, take your number, sit down, and in a few minutes they bring you your perfectly stir fried fresh and yummy meal. It's also cheaper and it has a theater style kitchen so you can sit and watch the chefs make your meal if you like. Cheap, yummy, easy, fresh, and vegetarian if you so choose.",2
"Great food, good service. I love it here. I go with my co workers and think it is some of the best Chinese around. A little pricey, but we found the portion sizes were big, so we share a few plates and it works out perfect. nThe first time I went we both ordered our own plates and found it was WAY to much food! nTried a few things on the menu and never got any bad food! nAs stated a little pricey.",2
We fell in love with O.H.S.O. immediately and we've been coming to OHSO regularly for some time with our kids for their 10 beer brunch on the weekends. I love their breakfast burrito on the beer brunch menu. On the regular menu my favorite is the brisket burger with a pitcher of something local or regional. n nO.H.S.O. is a great example of a locally owned restaurant supporting local breweries while working on their own and other local community organizations.,2
"Unfortunately I couldn't thoroughly enjoy my steak because I was still recovering from a sinus infection when I visited, but I enjoyed what little I could eat, and all of the items were reasonably priced. They had us seated just as we entered and took our orders, which were prepared promptly. Our waitress was quite friendly and accommodating the service was generally great. All in all, I would go back.",2
"Dammm this joint is good, I mean the pizza. n nCrushing all pizzerias in the area, no competition.delicious! n nThe crust is perfect. Light crisp in the outside and fluffy in the inside, not too thick and not to thin either. Gives me a NY feel when in the Williamsburg area devouring pizza at spot called Patrizia's. n nThe meats are plump and juicy, great quality, right amount of fresh cheese, I love it. n n5 stars for quality, presentation, and dining experience.",2
"Hail to the Orange, nHail to the Blue, nHail Alma Mater, nEver so true! nWe love no other nSo let our motto be nVictory, Illinoisssssssssssssss!

"Saskia Salon is still my go to for almost 3 years now. In the time I have been a client, I have gone through multiple and radical style color changes, enjoyed my sister's wedding day with a BEAUTIFUL do and also learned how to manage my crazy hair. Ally is a true talent in her industry. It has been lovely getting to know Saskia, the other stylists and staff. n nI trust them completely with my hair and also enjoy a mani pedi with Ally when my color is setting. Saskia Salon, you complete me ",2
I absolutely loved everything about this hotel. The design and details are modern and amazing. The breakfast is beyond expectations for a free hotel breakfast. The gym has everything you need for a quick workout. The staff is friendly and everything went smooth with the valet parking. I will stay here if I ever have to go back to Pittsburgh. It was honestly the highlight of my trip to this forgotten city.,2
"All I have to say is I love this place. n nI've always had great experiences here. I've come here a couple of times since they opened, and they have changed a few things but I still love it here. The environment is cool and fun and there are so many mouth water food choices. Even if you are just coming here for drinks, get their donut dessert! They make it fresh and it comes with 3 dipping sauces. Amazing!",2
"Gyros were very good! Meaty, with lots of tzatziki sauce. Possibly the best part about the meal was how much we enjoyed the tzatziki. It had a wonderful cucumber hint with the tart of yogurt. Not too thick but not runny either. Atmosphere was neat as well. Slightly off the square, you're not far from the lake, and there is a little less bustle here than on the square. They also serve breakfast items such as pancakes, French toast, bacon, and omelettes.",2
"I have been too all the hot clubs in LV, but I must say this place is nice, spacious and open. It didnt feel crowded and didnt take forveer to get in either. The night went well. Drinks were moderately priced. A good combo of music, and decent go go dancers. It didnt feel stuffy, hot or smelly. Bathrooms were nice and private. Doors went all the way down and you truly had your own stall. I will be back for this place.",2
My car died the other day while I was driving with 2 small children and I was able to coast into a national chain auto repair tire place. They essentially said my transmission was done for so I towed it to Absolute Auto to get a second opinion and because I don't trust those types of chains. n nThey were great and diagnosed my problem and it cost me a few hundred bucks. Will go here again and I recommend them to anyone who needs help with their automobile.,2
"If you're ever in the mood for sushi and you're in Vegas, but you want to stray away from the over crowded and over priced sushi from the strip. Head over to this sushi gem off the strip . n nThe staff are all legitimate Japanese and so is the food. Quality sushi you can taste. My bf and I ordered the ""Amy "" roll and the ""Yoshi "" roll and two soft shell crab hand rolls. Definitely did not disappoint.",2
"For sure this is my favorite place we stopped at during our vacation in Las Vegas. Perhaps it's because for the week or so previous, I had dined on a steady diet of fast food hamburgers or because I won 90 on the Yankees while there, but none the less it's an amazing sports bar book. If you are a sports fan, you'll be doing yourself a grave disservice not stopping here. n nP.S. It's in the Palazzo",2
"Small cute cafe with delicious food selections. I ordered a sandwich and it was just perfect. The portions are just right, as in you don't feel like you are about to check the box for obesity and have your health insurance sky rocket. The cranberry macadamia I vaguely remember was delicious too distracted by this factor to remember the type of cookie . Great place to stop by on the way to the airport too!",2
"I stopped by here to pick up something small for lunch. It was completely a random choice. And in so glad that I stumbled in here. The lamb pizza seemed pretty cool. I asked he waitress and she have it good reviews. nIt was amazing! The pizza was topped with tomatoes, feta, olives and lamb. It was a good portion size especially for the price 6 bucks! they didn't skimp on any of the toppings either. I would eat 1000 of those! It's safe to say that I will be going back here. And very soon!",2
"My boyfriend and I came here on a Groupon deal and we were so happy we did! The beer was fantastic and the atmosphere was comfortable and laid back. n nIt's a taproom, so if you're looking for the dinner and beer combo then this isn't the place. Now, if you're looking for a good beer, maybe some pretzels, and great people to talk to including the co founder George! then this is definitely the place you want to be. n nCan't wait to go again.",2
"The food was incredible. The wait was about 20 minutes at 6pm on a Friday night. They have this cool fountain drink machine that has all kinds of flavors of your favorite pop. Even raspberry diet coke! The manager was very helpful at finding us a place to sit as soon as it became available. For how busy they were, they didn't seem frazzled or rushed and everything seemed under control. Well managed place.",2
"Value in Vegas? So rare but so refreshing. Found the tickets on Travelzoo for 30. Costumes were great the performers put their heart into it. Lip synching and dancers were a little off but I lost count with the number of songs. Stage lacked pizzazz but overall my 20 something kids and I were very entertained. If you're burned out on dropping a fortune on a night out but want some fun, this is a good fit. Buckets of beers 16 speciality drinks were 2 12 making this a big win.",2
"Leaning toward 3.5 stars, actually. Boy are they gruff here, from the cashier to the behind the bar guys. We were startled to find out what we thought was one sandwich nicely split in two for two of us to share was actually two sandwiches period. Small ones at that, with no pickle, for 7.35. Ouch. The bread is nothing special, and there are no extras inside such as lettuce or sauerkraut. Just meat and thank goodness the meat was excellent. So juicy, with just enough fat.",2
"The service is usually really great. I say that because only 1 night have I questioned this and it was a party of 20 . The food is great and comes out very fast. The location can not be beat, who doesn't love the Tivoli Village area? They have a margaritas with a beer and a shot attached which can creep on you so be cautious when ordering this stinger. Enjoy a lovely evening under the stars or indoors. We personally love their patio.",2
"Dr. Glenn has been my Vet for a number of years, bringing several of my cats back from the brink of death. Recently my older girl needed some minor surgery to remove a lump and to get her teeth cleaned. The service at Lifecare Animal Hospital continues to be the best I've seen in the pet industry. Jolie has now had her stitches out and she's running, jumping and playing just like a kitten. Thank you Dr. Glenn for your continued care of my kitties! You are the best!",2
"Cheap tickets, beautiful stadium, pool inside the stadium and cheap value menu foods! n nThey aren't my hometown team, but since I live here now for the moment, I do enjoy coming here for ball games. We've been three times now seasoner opener, sf giants go lincecum! , and justin upton bobblehead giveaway day and it's been fun n nIt's just funny when people chant ""D Backs "" because the muffle of the crowd makes them sound like ""D Bags "" ",2
"I'm not big fan of alcohol in my food but every cookie we had was amazing. We were in Vegas for a friend's bday party and I wanted to get some special treats for the girls. The cookie bar worked out great. We ordered pina colada, snickerdoodle, mojito, booze munch, and white russan. Everything was delicious. They were were professional, returned my call promptly, and dropped off my order at my hotel included in the price.",2
"Great decor and atmosphere compliment this popular local hangout's good food and plentiful drink options. n nTypical German service ie, the waitstaff are nice, but too few and rather harassed and a slight lack of flexibility when it comes to special orders or substitutions are the only things that prevent a 5 star review. Otherwise, I've had an excellent cup of coffee or six at Extrablatt roughly translated to ""Extra edition "", as in Wuxtry! Wuxtry! Read alla bout it! .",2
"My buddy and I were in town to watch some Spring Training, while walking around Old Scottsdale we literally stumbled onto this place.and boy were we glad we did! It was not too packed for a Saturday nite but it soon picked up! . They had a fairly good tap selection, but the best was the price. 5.50 for 2 beers.the best price I've seen in Phoenix so far. The crowd had a good range of ages.It wasn't all college age kids like Tempe. Seems like a place I'd like to hang out at home.",2
"The kids and I went here and enjoyed it very much. One built his own burger, the other his own chicken wrap, and I got the meatloaf sandwich. The portions were tremendous and the service was very good, even though the place was quite crowded. I won't be raving to everyone I meet, but it's a lovely option here in Mint Hill, so nice to have somewhere to go that isn't a chain, and we'll definitely be back.",2
"Oh my goodness! I thought it wasn't going to be that amazing but I have not had this good of Thai Food in god knows how long. Eating in San Diego, Texas and Florida their Thai food has nothing on this little hole in the wall. No matter what you do in Vegas you have got to stop by here and try the food. Place is so nice, quaint and chill but their food is out of this world and spicy. Which is really what we all want when we are eating Thai. Try it, Love it, Pass on the good!",2
"We went to Dolce because we had a Groupon. I enjoyed the ""bread and beans "" very Italian. Our appetizer was the stuffed mushrooms very filling and good enough to be a main entree. I had the Amatriciana and my boyfriend had the Bolognese. Both were great and with generous portions. Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert. My two minor complaints were our wait for glasses of water and the distance between tables conversations were very close. nI would definitely go again.",2
"The burgers were delicious! Meaty and cheesy, and great flavor. I unfortunately, didn't care for the chencho fries, the sauce had a very strong lime flavor, which I personally thought was a little odd. I will definitely be back for a juicy burger, but will order regular fries next time. My husbands fried mushrooms were pretty tasty. FYI, there is limited seating in here, you may want to get it to go.",2
"This is my FAVORITE Restaurant in Las Vegas. My boyfriend and I came across it by accident as we were heading to the Shark Reef. The food is fabulous and has such an array of different flavors. The enchiladas and the carne asada quesadilla are to DIE for not to mention the watermelon lemonade! n nThe service is fabulous and is located near the Shark Reef, away from all the hussle and bussle of the casino.and it is close by the pool as well. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!",2
"Best filipino fast food I've eaten in Vegas. nBuffet style setup where you see the food that's already cooked and ready to be served. Customer service is good with a busboy who is very friendly always cleaning. n nThe biggest downfall is that filipino food is that it's not that healthy for you. Eat responsibly lol n nTry the Tocino, Fried Pork anything that they serve. It's as filipino tasting as it gets!",2
Got a pedicure here today and it was a good experience. The salon is clean and I like that they have curtains between the chairs to give you a little privacy. I also liked that the employees were not chatting across the room to each other in a foreign language. n nThe price for a basic pedicure is 22 if you pay cash and 24 credit. All tips are requested to be cash. n nMy only complaint about the pedicure is I wish the massage lasted longer.,2
Tiny spot with limited parking but worth it for some tasty food that is likely different than anything you have had before. The Papa a La Huancaina looks meh but the taste is fabulous! The fried rice dish was so tasty and plenty for me to have lunch the next day. It's a little expensive for an ethnic hole in the wall but the food is good enough that I'm sure Ill be back for more. They are super friendly too!,2
"I love that they have many more toppings compared to some of the other fro yo places in Charlotte. The clerks always seem to be happy on each of my visits, no complaints about cleanliness and nice flow of traffic to the yogurt. Comparable prices as the other shops, yet there are some rotation of different flavors. It is a good idea to sign up for the Menchies club. We will keep coming by for sweet frozen treat.",2
"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The atmosphere is very soothing and comfortable. The noise level is very low and their decor is nice. I've come here a total of 3 times once with a friend, once with parents and once by myself. I always start off with their shrimp and pork spring rolls. Love love love them! Their phos not the best but they're not bad. I usually get their rice vermicelli with char grilled pork, which is delicious!",2
"Real good late night chinese food and on time deliverey service as well. We ordered 3 entrees, Mongolian beef very good and right spicy, kung pao chicken good, and honey walnut shrimp to die for. Also, I said I had a coupon but didn't, they needed to actually have the coupon, since I didn't have a coupon,they gave us free wontons, which were really good. Thanks! I love this chinese spot and we will be ordering again. Ps. They said 45 mins and they were on time.",2
"This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. n nEveryone was friendly and engaging. Marcos, our server, was attentive, charming, informative and helpful.without being intrusive. n nThe food was outstanding. The menu is eclectic.and fantastic! I have never enjoyed Brussels sprouts.and tonight I had seconds. n nThe scallops were excellent. Others had the filet and the salmon.and everyone rave about it. n nNot cheap. Very much worth it.",2
"Jacob Palmer might not approve of the GAP, but I am a huge fan. This is one of the nicest GAP stores in Las Vegas. The selection of clothes is varied. The only issue is their sales area is heavily picked and tends to be slim. n nWith summer winding down, most of the stores are in the midst of clearing out their inventory. The best part, we stay warm until the end of October. I like the ombre t shirts and the colored skinny khakis.",2
"Modern little place with a cool vibe. Young, enthusiastic workers take your order at the counter You can watch the guys work the grill. There are lots of burger, chicken, salad choices. There's a dining bar with stools and there are booths. I had the delicious Charburger and onion rings my dining companion had the Charburger and sweet potato fries. We had this to go.and our order came up quickly just before the lunch rush. No drive thru available.",2
"I went last Memorial Day weekend for my brother's 50th birthday dinner. 8 adults,2 kids . Everyone sampled someone else's meal but most of the group got steaks I didn't but wish I had tried the wagyu beef . I loved my crab cakes and the shared creme brulee. We had a private area an attentive waiter. Good food but pricier than I would have wanted to pay meal was a treat by my brother to all of us . We were there a good 3 hrs with drinks,meals desserts and no one rushed us.",2
Excellent job all around having our home windows tinted. Started with windows in dining room family area liked it so much added tinting to kitchen windows. RIck was fair and very courteous we enjoyed doing business with him. He was clear on what the tint would do and what it wouldn't do which was important to know. I'm not sure all vendors would give people this straight information. I would definitely recommend Cactus Window Tint.,2
"We stayed here last week and we found the hotel to be pleasant, the pool's view of The Eiffel Tower is amazing , Their outdoor and indoor Jacuzzis Are amazing as well nThe fitness room is decent with complimentary snacks and lemon water nThe women's locker area showers were very nice they provide Shaving cream shower gel, shampoo conditioner, free razors nThe had a nice set up with hair dryers flat irons curling iron mousse hair spray",2
"We ordered a few things items but I especially enjoyed a sushi with unagi on a fried tempura thing on top of sushi, pork tataki, and the kimchi fried rice. n nThe honey toast was made up of really simple ingredients. honey, hawaiian bread, butter, and vanilla ice cream. but it was a really satisfying treat at the end of our meal. n nI think almost everyone there had some sort of a tattoo which was compiled of either a fish, chinese symbol, cherry blossom, or all three. FISH TATTOOS. AWESOME!",2
"I really enjoyed visiting this place in fact, I was there twice in the same weekend as it's a great spot for pre ASU events too! Great menu, friendly people and a cool space for breakfast lunch. I also like that they support local artists by displaying their art throughout great vibe! n nMy food was fantastic I had the Chicken Salad Sandwich and really liked the kick they put in it to make it unique. The service was great as well and I can't wait until they get their patio!",2
"Usually every starbucks I have been to has pretty great costumer service, I was so excited about this starbucks opening up since is right in between my work and home. Well I have got to say that this is by far the best Starbucks I have been to, costumer service completely blows my mind here and I love how helpful they are. There is one guy who explained to me the iced coffees and a lot about one of the machines and I was in heaven learning about all of this! For sure one of my favorite spots!",2
"I'm going to bump this to 4 because I really like to gamble here. n nYes, it's seedy and old and jenky. You have to embrace that to be here. But the dealers are all really friendly, and they have 5 blackjack tables! Also, they have 0.50 1 no limit poker tables that don't have too much of a line, and which have plenty of action. n nI am hoping the place will still be awesome after they remodel and reopen.",2
"Stayed at the Signature this past weekend so we went to Delights for a post night of drinking meal, and it was good. n nI got the Las Vegas Blvd sandwich I think that's the one I got it was a sandwich with Skirt steak, fried egg, caramelized onions, and a sauce. It was so good, my only real complaint is the proportions are kind of small and it's a bit pricey. n nI paid 12 for a sandwich but it was a really good sandwich so no real complaints.",2
"After reading the reviews here, I took my cat in today who hadn't peed in 2 days . I was fearing the worst about kidney disease. n nWHAT a good experience. I was quite nervous about the cat, and the girl at the front was not only knowledgeable, but kind and honest as well. I don't feel like I was scalped financially, and I feel good about the outcome for the cat antibiotics and UT treats should do the trick . n nHighly recommend. And I'm picky.",2
"This place has amazing cookies, thrifty ice cream and great service. The cookies were so good, I'll probably just skip the ice cream next time and get cookies and milk! n nThe peanut butter cookie was the best I've ever had. It has the perfect ratio of sweet and salty. Don't let the ""gluten free "" moniker scare you, it was the best part of my sandwich. n nI also LOVE that it is about half the price of big chain ice cream stores, with better quality and I'm supporting a small, local business.",2
