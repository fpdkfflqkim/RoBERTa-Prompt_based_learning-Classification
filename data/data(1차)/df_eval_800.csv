OK who doesn't love some boom ass gelato! I came in tonight craving something sweet and was not let down. I was greeted instantly and given multiple free samples. I usually have go to flavors but was given some I would have never picked to sample. I instantly fell in love with the tiramisu. One scoop came in a cute pink reusable bowl with a waffle cookie for about 4. n nThe lady working there was super nice. She told me all about the gelato's and that they are all made in house. n nIf your looking for a cute hang out spot come here! Free wifi and lots of seating.,2
"Not a fan. n nMaybe I have been spoiled with Fogo de Chao and Gaucho's Village in LA. But i have also been to smaller brazilian steakhouses and experienced much better. n nWe came in with a reservation late on a saturday night. We were seated right away. We went with the Rodizio which is the all you can eat churrasco with the salad bar. I don't know if it was because it was late at during the night but it wasn't like the place was empty and people were continuing to come in through out our stay. The 'gaucho's' took FOREVER to come out. I mean, they were nowhere in sight. n nThey finally came by with some filet mignon with parmesan cheese. It was good but nothing special. Interesting flavor but nothing to rave about. They then brought some ham which the bf said was good. I had some brazilian sausage that was good. They kept bringing out the filet mignon and i wanted some picanha, some lamb. something they did not bring until 45 minutes 1 hour that we had been there. By that time, appetite was gone. Still tried some of the picanha but it was meh. They also did not ask how we wanted it medium medium rare, etc which is not a requirement but I have always been asked that at churrascarias. Pan de queijo was pretty good, and since the meat took so long, we filled up on that. Good, but not worth a 40 dollar meal for cheese bread! n nService by our waiter was decent and we came in with a restaurant.com coupon which always helps. Still, with so many good options in vegas, I am not coming back.",1
"I love coming here. If I want good fast quality Mexican food, then this is the place. My friend recommended this place to me after telling him that I miss eating tortas from back home. I was sold with my first torta on my first visit. I come here so often that one of the girls knows me by name now. n nI haven't tried the whole menu yet, but I do love the Paquime torta, carn u00e9 asada torta, and ribeye torta. The cucumber drink is delicious too. I will also buy their deserts pan dulce, tres leches, choco flan.",2
Yum! The pastries here are wonderful and remind me so much of a French patisserie! Well done!,2
" 6.99 per person for lunch buffet. So cheap, right? Well, you get what you pay for. The Mongolian BBQ was pretty good, as well as the soups. Other stuff was just meh. A lot of greasiness. n nProbably won't be going here again, even though the restaurant was packed. I think I'll try a real Asian buffet next time.",1
"A great alternative to the other brunch places I frequent. Absolutely as good as the other go to places in Las Vegas. I eat at the counter because the staff is so friendly. n nI typically get the veggie omelette with egg whites, and I havent been disappointed. n nThe price is really reasonable as well. Go check it out!",2
"Diablo's is definitely a place you want to go to during your next trip to Vegas. After sitting there for a minute, I realized that I had already fallen in love with this place without even tasting the food. The atmosphere was cool and upbeat and the place was packed! Thank God for reservations. I wasn't that hungry when I got there and noticed the HUGE portions. Mounds of nachos, the hugest pyramid of guacamole, cocktails by the pitcher. I opted for an appetizer chicken and pork taquitos. I also added a side of rice and beans. Deeeelicious! My friend and I ordered a pitcher of Sinful Vixen and yes, as others have noted it is AMAZING! Sweet but you can definitely taste the alcohol. Our other two friends weren't going to drink as they were saving up for one of those guitars full of liquor at the Rock House. Buuut once they had a sip of Sinful Vixen we had to order another pitcher for them! The only reason why this place is not getting a 5 star rating is because the service was a bit slow partly because of the flock of diners. I will definitely come back to Diablo's again and again though. I'll post some pictures later.",2
I go here all the time it is absolutly awsome! California burrito has to be the best thing on the menu.,2
"This was my second time to China Star buffet.I was looking for a cheap lunch buffet, but the signs on the outside contradict each other one says 5.99 until 4pm and the other, which I didn't see, was Sunday all day 8.99. They could use some clarification. n nThe food was pretty old I had to spit out a couple bites of my food because they tasted funny or I could not chew it. The ""Mongolian BBQ "" portion was okay though. n nThe service was severely lacking it took asking to get water refills, and the girl at the front desk was a little nasty. n nI would not go back here.",1
This place is awesome. Mike is very knowledgable and friendly. Very Clean. Look no where else.,2
"This restaurant features a nice dining experience and delicious food. The mood in the restaurant is dark, kinda of romantic, but great for parties. The menu has a nice variety of American cuisine, delicious and prepared and presented well. highly recommended for a special occasion.",2
"Terrible. The place was empty, yet I was served by beer in a HOT glass? odd. I ordered beef fajitas, and they were terrible, with much of it being such bad meat it was inedible. The food was also extremely bland. I asked for chips and salsa, only to never get any. n nIt was terrible, and I wont go back in my travels to Phoenix.",1
"I bought a new house and decided to purchase a few rooms worth of new furniture including a bedroom set, living room set and a few other things. I had seen commercials for the Roomstore and knew they had a discounted pricing structure based on whole room purchases. well look at that I was purchasing a few whole rooms. n nAs soon as I walk in the door I was greeted by a gentlemen in a full suit. A furniture salesman in a full 3 piece with jacket and tie. like an interview outfit for a salaried job. Danger Will Robinson Danger! He introduced himself as a two letter name which I will not be so low as to reveal here we will just call him B.S. because it is going to fit the story. Well B.S. showed us some nice furniture and we picked out everything. A really odd thing was as we selected furniture B.S. could never tell us the exact price of what we were buying and he was writing everything down on paper. So anyway we finish picking stuff out and he gives us a general idea of the price. We say we will think about it and leave. n nA week later my wife goes back in finalizes our selection and is given a total price of 5400 OTD. She informs B.S. that I will be in next saturday to pay the entire balance and set up delivery. So I show up saturday he shows me all chosen products and we sit down to handle payment. The price he now quotes is 6800. I laugh at him and he does some backtracking about what he said then changes the price to 6400 to which I continue to laugh at. n nI tell him to give me a print out of this price break down with each item so I can take it back to my wife and ask if she wants to continue working with B.S. and if so to choose which items to remove because our moving budget does not allocate this amount to furniture. n nB.S. calls us again and tells us to pick out a few cheaper items to get down to the 5400. Duh thanks for the help. Long story less long we did not purchase. If you want your furniture buying experience to feel like a used car purchase this is the place for you.",1
"I would never rent from this complex ever! I work for WF and I was denied an apartment right away after paying for an application fee. The reason was because of a traffic ticket. When I called the management company for a refund, they advised me that someone would call me. I had to call back again for the Hallkeen Mgmnt Co to contact Ten 05 again for someone to call me back. The manager at Ten05 advised me that she called. I have NO missed calls or voicemails. She then proceeded to tell me I was denied for reasons she can't explain and she would love to override the errors and lease me a new unit but not refund me my money after I already leased an apartment elsewhere and was FULLY approved! I also had to pull my own records and research with their IT company who said that the reason I was denied was due to a traffic ticket that wasn't even showing on my record in the first place. Then they told me it was for my credit, which is BS because I was approved for a mortgage. DO NOT LEASE FROM THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX! Waste of time and money!",1
"I might change my review IF I EVER GET TO EAT HERE! n nI have tried 3 times this month to try and eat at this establishment. nThe first time I pulled in and found a note on the door stating they were closed do to a family emergency. nOkay. I understand that. n nThe second time they were open and had a pair of customers at a table inside. nI approached the counter to order a couple of pounds of brisket. nI was then informed that they were OUT OF BRISKET. Now this was lunch time. What restaurant runs out of brisket at lunch time with only a pair of customers? nSo I left, deciding I'd give this place one last try. n nToday, yes, New year's eve day, I tried again. And once again, there was a note on the door stating that the restaurant was closed until Jan. 2nd for vacation. n nNow I realize that everyone deserves a vacation. But it seems this place is either closed for some random reason or out of food. n nI guess i'll stick with either Waldo's for ribs or Texas bbq house for brisket. n nI don't know if i'll even bother trying to try this place again. .",1
My co workers and I came here for lunch. We ordered the chicken nachos and found two long hairs in them. It was totally gross. Other than that the food is ok.,1
Best NY style pizza in the Valley! I lived around the corner from the Chandler location for a few years and went all the time delivery was always on time and arrived hot too . I still go out of my way to get pizza there.,2
"This is without a doubt my favourite Chinese Taiwanese in town. Straight forward cuisine, executed consistently and to perfection. One warning, their spicy is SPICY. Specials on the wall, and Chinese Idol playing on the TVs the vibe is amazing. I highly recommend the spicy cumin lamb, and the eggplant dishes. n nEvery diner is brought a tiny amuse bouche of peanuts and soybean, even this start is amazingly tasty. But this is just a start, the large menu is full of variety. Often on weekend mornings you'll see the staff cutting hot chilies, take this as a warning, and a sign. Eat spicy. Order with a bowl of rice for authenticity, and to help cut the heat. The portions are quite generous, one plate easily feeds a single person, but it's best, and meant to be, served family style. Bring a friend or two, and order several plates and share. n nThe waitstaff is friendly, and knowledgeable, they'll happily recommend something to suit your taste and mood, the prices are affordable, and the quality is always top notch. In short, a must visit for asian cuisine.",2
"This was my 2nd visit and although 1st time was a disappointment I'm definitely a fan. I first stopped by last year right after a trip to New Orleans, was super excited to see barbecue shrimp on the menu. It ended up being a big let down think it was 17 or 18 for 4 shrimp in a not spicy sauce and a huge mound of rice. I left feeling a little ripped off it felt like that should've been a 12 appetizer vs an entree. nI went with friends for lunch last week and LOVE Lola's now. We were seated outside and I think the server forgot about us for a while. But the food made up for it. I had the soft shell crab po boy huge, bread was cut in half with 1 crab in each so perfect for sharing. Crispy yummy crab on their light flaky bread. I got the potato salad, which was just ok. Fries were also mediocre, but sweet potato fries were possibly the best I've ever had. Had some of my friends fried shrimp po boy too only 4 shrimp total, which is a little skimpy but the shrimp were pretty fat and super sweet. nAlso tried a bite of someones blackened catfish. I've never been a fan of catfish but this was so spicy and flavorful I'd totally order it next time. nRhythm kitchen is still my fav Creole place in town but I'm loving Lola's for their po boys. Oh and the buttered grilled bread they bring you is also a must",2
"This place is bullshit. The cupcakes still suck, but if they couldn't suck enough, they actually got smaller! As far as ""Restaurant Week "" goes, Daisy should take note that they're actually a part of Restaurant Weak. I hate the cupfakery, their annoying food that third graders can make, and prices only idiots would pay.",1
"Kept on hearing I had to try this place! Many kept on comparing to another taco place that is very popular in Vegas. Yes , yes , "" Tacos el Fatty "" ! Where to start ? I walked in and never as busy as the comparison and the staff was to busy talking to each other instead of helping the few customers they did have. I almost left, but another customer walked over and asked if it was my first time. Probably my confused look I Said yes and he explained how it all works. Your typical taco place where you go order what you want from where you want it. Tortillas smelled good and they taste home made. The tacos were good, but nothing out of this world. I would not compare as they hold their own, but will admit the way they are prepared is very untraditional ! I've seen the local and the traditional taquero who prepare a taco with passion and ensures it's delicious. These were more of Taco Bell style where they know they need to add this and that because somebody told them that is what it should have . Making a good tacos is an art. Believe it or not! The tacos de Asada were good and will admit better than tacos el fatty. However then we come to al pastor ! I stand that Tacos El gordo has the best al pastor. The meat , the seasoning , and that green sauce makes the taco Amazing and Taco y Taco was good as the pineapple in top adds flavor but the meat was a little cold and lacked flavor compared to others. In closing if you are hungry and want tacos Al pastor and can't wait or don't feel like driving then yes this is your place. However if you want a great tacos al pastor this would not be the place . Also the place was not as clean as it could have been. In my opinion with the amount of employees present floors should have been spotless , fountain drink area should have been clean and salsa bar should have been up kept. Oh not all was that bad . The corn on the Cobb with all the fixing was amazing and I would go back just for that!",1
"We went to Sugar Factory with a Groupon and I guess we shouldn't have told them we had it before ordering. The Groupon was for brunch for 2 with unlimited mimosas and bloody marys for 2 ppl. Before telling them we were offered an array of flavors for our mimosas, after, we were told there were only the regular flavors available. The mimosas were also very, very small so even in ""unlimited "" fashion you are lucky to have had 2 total. The food was OK, definitely not worth the 15 per plate price and drinks? You are looking at 15 30 per drink. Yes they are specialty drinks but still not that special! Our waitress came over to check on us what seemed like every 3 minutes way too often. Overall, maybe a good place to go for specialty dessert but we won't be back for the food, especially with a discount.",1
"Really 3.5 stars, but I will round up this time because I am in a good mood. nI was shopping Macy's going out of business sale and unlike most females, I just hate to shop. But when it comes to cocktail dresses for 9, I finally give in. After spending several tedious hours trying on clothes, I need nourishment before heading to work. In a moment of weakness, I stroll through the food court, but who am I kidding? I hate food courts and even in a nicer mall like the Fashion Show, the outlets all offer the same junk. nSo now I am torn between Maggiano's and Stripburger. After browsing both menus, I choose the latter. It is a gorgeous day and Stripburger has all outdoor seating right on the strip. nAll of their burgers are 8.95 9.95. The fries are not included. The drink menu looks tempting, but like I said, I am headed to work soon, so I settle for something from the Lake Mead region. nMy burger comes in less than 15 minutes and is cooked exactly as ordered. The accompaniments roll, tomato, etc. are all fresh and this is a very good burger. nWould I make a trip to the strip just to eat here? Probably not. But I would definitely come back should I be caught hungry in that area again and maybe next time I can sample some of their adult beverages.",2
"This place is really pretty good. You have to remember this is americanized mexican food in a casino but they do a pretty good job. Margaritas are very good, nachos were great they offer o ""to go "" window. I would not hesitate at all to stop in here next trip.",2
"My office is close to this restaurant now and I was craving for GREAT itialian food. I have not been there for years but I remembered how yummy their food was. nThe young waitress was very friendly, courteous and I asked her should I get the pizza or one of the other lunch special specials? She did mention receiving a salad with the meal and suggested the pizza is the BEST! nThe WORST thing the waitress could do was not come back to me with a salad that I thought I was going to receive. One of her customers came in and she had a longgggg conversation and totally forgot me as a customer and still waiting for my salad. Waiting for about 15 minutes. I stood up and told 2 other employees who were having a break at a table. They attended to me with the salad and one of them explained that I really wasn't suppose to have had the salad with the pizza. I explained that the young lady and I were talking about 2 different type of lunches and I thougt she said salad was complimenting both. I then told the other employee IF the young lady came back to check back on me IF I needed anything, she could have told me then I wasn't suppose to have received a salad, BUT there was ""no "" checking back on me at all! I also was waiting for a refill on my drink and told them again I was waiting and I was going to the bathroom. At this time I was totally disgusted. Then when I walked out of the bathroom, the young lady was talking about how I wasnt suppose to have received the salad. I interrupted her and said IF she would have only checked back with me, I would have been ok with her level of service. nI haven't been back since and not sure IF I ever will. nThe OTHER employee did comp me as she said she WANTED me to come back and she was sorry. nThis is a mom and shop restaurant and I am shocked that with ALL the restaurants going out of business that this level of service exists. nThis wasnt a real recent visit but thought it should be mentioned.",1
"It only gets one star because yes there are decent things underneath it all. Yes its dirty and unsanitary, there was a cockroach in one of the bins! But the worst are the employees, never met more rude people in my life. The guy bringing out bins yelled at me after grabbing one item, and it was my first time so I didn't know you weren't allowed to grab until it was all out. He talked to the customers like they were dogs ""NO! DON'T TOUCH "" and the cashiers, talk about hormone driven teens worse than ever. We got into one line and the cashier told me I was allowed to go to the next cashier and the next cashier was making out with another employee at the register. And she tells us to go back to the other cashier and yells at the girl saying ""can't you see I'm busy. "" She didn't even bag the items she just handed me the plastic bags. RUDE!",1
"I had the Five O, aka the Vegetarian's Nightmare. It was a good sandwich! n nWhat I didn't like was that I felt all confused about ordering and picking the food up. I also couldn't hear what they were asking me over the music which, BTW, I liked the Drum Bass . n nWill I be back? Sure!",2
"i love this theater. usually quiet in the AM if you like to take advantage of their 5 before noon promotion. they validate parking and the staff is normally pretty nice. my bf and i will normally hit up an early movie, then stick around and grab lunch at one of the restaurants near by.",2
"Now they have a small grocery section near checkout so you can wander through the food selection and have some vanilla frozen yogurt! Why does a furniture store always smell so good! nThey did away with most of the self checkout lines and now have more associates at the registers, which speeds up the process a little. nReturns still quick and easy.",2
Great atmosphere and unbelievable food! Robert took great care of me and was very prompt. If you are looking for a unique twist on classic breakfast I would highly recommend this place. It is worth the 5 mile drive from the strip.,2
I visit this store often because it has just what I need. Tons of cashiers who help get you in and out without a head ake! Staff who are educated in their special department. And nice sells. I swear I'm at this location at least once per week.,2
This place was very nice to stay at. The room was very cool looking n it was jus the basic one. We got a view of the strip right in front of bellagio got to see the water show all day every day! The bed was soooo comfy to! The only thing was is they ddnt have many places to hang out or many choices to eat we always had to leave the hotel n go somewhere else although they do have my fav resteraunt in there PF Changs! Overall I would def recommend for the price n the location on the strip.,2
"Since we were staying at Imperial Palace, why not eat at hash house since i have been wanting to try it. n nI had the sage chicken benedict. I knew their portions were huge but damn every dish that came out was MASSIVE. I actually was a huge heffer this weekend and I ate my whole plate don't judge me . Everyone knows how big and artery clogging this could be but i ate every bit of it. I loved the everything the benedict came with, however i wished it came with poached eggs not fried egg. I love the drippy egg yolks, too bad it wasn't on this one. The biscuit and mashed potatoes were good. It did get very heavy and difficult to eat but with everything together a piece of egg, tomato, crispy bacon, and a piece of that juicy chicken made it more delicious. The chicken wasn't too crispy because of the sauce but it was nice and juicy, not dry at all. I must say.those tomatoes are AMAZING. So sweet and juicy. If there was a whole one on my plate.i'd eat it like an apple. It was that good I love tomatoes . n nWe wanted to eat there again before we left but it was not possible. They need to open later on sundays too! People are still hungry! n n nService was great, the wait was about 30 40 mins but it really wasn't that bad, it went by fast. Just go down stairs to gamble a little to kill some time. n n GO ! a must go you might like it or you might not, but you should try n n n nP.S. Share the plate. Everything is HUGE.",2
"My wife visited Ta Ta Bistro on Thursday, 2 11 2010, and I have been regularly going to Ta Ta Bistro about once or twice a month for about one year now. Normally the food is at least four stars on the Yelp scale during dinner. This time we went to lunch. I should have known when I saw we were the only ones dining besides the employees , that maybe we should have come back later. But alas hunger prevailed. n nWe stayed for what we thought should have been the same quality we normally experience when we visit Ta Ta Bistro. No. Our waiter never smiled, not once! I felt like we were bothering him from the moment we sat down. Strike one. n nWe ordered appetizers, the snow crab tempura. Now, my wife normally orders the same thing over and over so as not to be disappointed. I of course asked her to try something new, and she did reluctantly I'm sooooo sorry honey . The so called snow crab tempura was not at all as it seemed from the menu description. n nAs a loyal Ta Ta Bistro fan I must admit to being thoroughly disappointed. The menu described succulent SNOW CRAB LEGS battered in tempura and it was to be served with lemon and butter. I asked the non smiling waiter, ""How is the snow crab tempura ""? and he said ""You know everything is always good "" hmmm.that should have been a clue . When they came out to the table. tears from reliving the moment . It was none other than Imitation ""Krab "" with a K from the grocery store deli! You know the stuff you normally serve cold or put in ""Krab "" with a K salad? n nI asked the non smiling waiter what was the deal with this. I said ""this is not crab meat this is Imitation Krab with a K "", to which he said, ""We use imitation crab in ours "". Strike 2! I told him the menu describes ""SNOW CRAB LEGS ""! not imitation anything. When he saw how upset we were, no apology was given he just said I take that for you, and carried off my plate of fake KRAB with a K made of Pollock not crab. n nNow I was worried because we had not received our Japanese lunch box with ""Rib eye steak "". Rib eye is my favorite steak. He did not serve me rib eye. It was that cheaper cut of meat used for pepper steak. Strike 3! And of course it was pre sliced and drenched in terriyaki so who's gonna argue with that it's rib eye. I know the texture of Rib eye. It is not a gelatinous tendon filled meat ever. n nNeedless to say I am very disappointed in Ta Ta Bistro. Very, very, very, disappointed. It raises the question if the SNOW CRAB LEGS THE RIB EYE STEAK were imitation what else is imitation? I hope they get it together soon. n nPlease keep in mind I normally call over the manager when things go good or really good. And I would have called over the manager for this incident but the non smiling waiter was keeping him informed the whole time, so there was no need. Needless to say it will be a while before we have the stomach or nerve to go back.",1
"Highly overrated. The Dole Whip I got was 6 and it's cheaper at Disneyland! Imagine that Disneyland with it's overpriced food. the portion was about 2 3 that of the one at Disneyland. n nWhite rabbit food trick fell major short adobo taco was dry and bland and tiny tasteless! Wanted to throw it straight to the trash and after 1 bite that's what I did. n nSnow Fluff thai tea was bland and gross. Tried hard to eat it but it went into the trash. Maybe other flavors are better? n nWhite Castle was the best food I tried here and soon they will have a restaurant at the Las Vegas strip. n nMajor rip off. Overpriced and greasy food. Long lines and waits. You are better off going elsewhere. If you want to feel forced to eat disgusting food for your hard earned money, go here. I won't be back.",1
"Made plans to take my girlfriend on this tour for her birthday. Live an hour and a half from Charlotte. Bought tickets a month in advance, made plans to make a whole day out of it.

"staff are friendly only when you are waiting in line.Once at the counter they act as if you are wasting their time.the receipts do not show the price that you get the ticket at.they combine useless buffet menus saying they are free when the seem to charge a price for the same.you get a dollar amount when you pay without a cost breakup.after about 3 times with tix4tonight, i am starting to question their business model and possible unscrupulous practices.",1
"Hand's down the worst experience ever! The ""manager "" Carlos is a prick! He is rude! He called me the B word! The bouncer said my ID was not me. and told me to GET OUT like as if he was taming animals in a zoo! I am a lady. I wasn't rude! When I went to speak with Carlos I told him can you please look at my ID . It is me! I can go get my ATM card even tho I had my credit card with me. He said, "" NO! Your not getting in at all "" While I was talking to Carlos a bouncer told my friend you guys should go before your arrested. I was just talking to him.

"I was craving meat jun, drove to the outdated address that was listed. The person who answered wasn't sympathetic at all. Paid 14 for 1 thin slice kalbi almost see through, 1 piece BBQ chicken and 1 slice meat jun. I coulda got cheaper in Hawaii. I specifically asked for Koch jun sauce which they did not give me in my to go plate, and no chopsticks really?!?!? If I could I would give this a negative 1 star for the entire experience. So shame an waste my time, gas, and money!",1
"I was disappointed. n nI dined in the restaurant Saturday evening. Everyone that worked there was courteous and friendly. Unfortunatley, the food wasn't all that. n nThe chips and salsa were ok, but the refried beans looked and tasted like Rosarita refried beans. n nI order a 2 item combination dinner and chili rellano side dish. n nBeef Taco Beef was tasty, but disappointed in the taco shell it was paper thin. n nChicken Enchilada bland and saugy. The tortilla that wrapped the chicken was thin and mushy. The chicken was seasoned well. n nChili Rellano it was standard. Nothing spectacular. n nMexican Rice standard. n nRefried Beans I'm CONVINCED they are from out of the can! n n Overall it was disappointing. n nPrior to dining in the restaurant, I went into the restaurant to obtain a menu and I spoke to the hostess. I asked if their tortillas were handmade. She said, ""yes "". After dining in the restaurant, the tortillas may very well be handmade, but they are handmade paper thin. The tortilla chips were thicker than the taco shell and enchilada. n nMy bill came out to about 15 which is typical of a restaurant of this caliber. But for the same money I paid for this dinner, I could have eatten at a Lindo Bonito Michocan and listened to LIVE entertainment since it was a Saturday night. n nOne thing that I did notice, there was a large party leaving the restaurant's private dining room. They looked to be Mexican nationals, which I assume were friends of the owners or family. All I could think is ""I wonder how these Mexicans liked the food because as a Mexican myself, it was subpar "". n nMy reccomendation would be for the owners to check out Leticia's Cocina located in the NW to experience AUTHENTIC Mexican food.",1
"I've always been amazed this place has been around as long as it has and gets mentioned so much as a ""must "" place to eat.its average AT BEST, everything except for the tacos is decent to fair and how bad can u screw up a taco? , and the service wait staff, even after all these yrs they've been open, is spotty at best, I.E. the kind of service you'd expect in a new place, not one thats been open for yrs like this place.plus its WAY overpriced for what u get",1
"Best Greek restaurant in Vegas nThe sea food is out of this world. They have you choose a fresh fish and cook it right then and there for you. Grilled with a slight amount of oil, capers and lime. Wow!. nAlso had a chance to taste the filet Mignon. Incredible. Excellent wine selection. This place is a ""must visit "" if you are ever in Vegas. Highly recommended",2
"Horrible! Firstly it was way overpriced.kid's price was only 2 dollars cheaper that adult. After paying 75 for me and my 2 kids 8yr and 4yrs we were sat down at a dirty table. When I asked for a clean table she acted like it was a chore. Then I proceeded to get my son some food. When I picked up the tongs I noticed a bug flying around. Upon closer inspection there were numerous bugs flying around the food! And many more dead in the ice that surrounded the cold food and salad! A couple were crawling on their sandwiches! I put down the plate and requested the manager for a full refund. Though the manager was courteous, it took him 20 min to issue my refund! And while I was standing there waiting for him to do the refund they continued to take more guests money and seat them. I take the 1 star I gave this place back and give them 0! Do not eat here unless u like unexpected friends in your food!",1
Excellent bagels and cream cheese flavors. I wish they would brew better coffee to make the breakfast experience complete.,2
"I wish there was an option for 0 stars, but I guess please take this review as a warning to GO TO ANOTHER LOCATION. I've lived in NC for over 6 months now and my MA inspection was out of date so I figured ok, time to get everything changed over. Little did I know I was in a for almost a full day of pain and torture. n nI had scheduled one day off between jobs with the intention to get all of this stuff done in the morning. I arrived early like everyone said, not at 6am but closer to 8 30, half hour after they opened. There was already a line of about 45 50 people waiting outside. Oh boy. After being in that line for 2 hours I finally talked to someone and told them I needed to get a license in NC, meaning I had to take a test ridiculous if you ask me. I then was seated for another 2 hours while I waited for my number to be called. They called a number MAYBE once every 20 minutes at most. In total there were 4 people working in the entire place and one of them went on lunch break for an hour leaving 3 people to handle the entire DMV. n nLuckily I passed my test, I arrived at 8 30am and didn't leave until 2 30pm. I then stupidly went to the other office to get new plates, nope. You have to wait until you get your actual license in the mail.the temporary one won't work. What an incredible pain. n nOn a brighter note to get my plates I went to the location on Brookshire Blvd after I got my license in the mail. I arrived right at 8am and was done with everything with plate in hand by 8 15. ADVICE GO TO THE BROOKSHIRE BLVD LOCATION.",1
"As with most 2 star restaurants, I don't have too much to say. n nThe bagels were ""good "". The corned beef hash was ""good "". Service was ""ok "". Pancakes ""did the job "". There was nothing truly remarkable about this place. n nEXCEPT. the waitress was noteworthy. She was consistently dropping parts of meals! I watched 2 pieces of bacon slide off the plate when she rounded a corner. and proceed to put it on our table! I even had to call her attention to it, and she needed to be reminded that we needed replacements! Later on she dropped someone's bagel basket completely. Now I know everyone has their days, but this lady was not in good form. n nNeedless to say, I don't plan on going back. I'd much rather go to the Cracked Egg instead see my review for it .",1
"I'm doing two because the guy I talked to was nice and the driver as well. However this pizza. Not to great. It arrived lukewarm at best. I live less the a mile away. I asked for the meat to be separate ordered a half and half , first bite, got a bite of meat. fed it to my dogs. They didn't like it. Soooo I donno.",1
Service was friendly but slow. Took 20 minutes for a salad when I was the only person in the restaurant . Salad was excellent a little pricey at 12.95. This could be a great place if they fine tuned the service and paid attention to the details.,1
The food at this place is shockingly overrated. Populated by a bunch of aging HOG members who like to pretend they are gangsters on Friday and Saturday nights. Nothing wrong with that but the food is honestly pretty bad. Fun atmosphere though which is the draw. It's really a great bar but a mediocre restaurant.,1
