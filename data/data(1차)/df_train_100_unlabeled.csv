"We were looking for a nice dumpling spot in Chinatoen and ended up settling for this place after a long walk. The host was very nice and quiet but helpful. The food came out at an average rate. It wasn't the best presentation but it was edible. The food was a little bland but it made us full. n nThe WORST and most awful part of this experience was when we went to pay. We walked up to the cashier who was so incredibly rude. She demanded a minimum ten percent tip. We usually leave more, but her rude yelling resulted in exactly ten percent. Tip is optional and should not be forced upon the customers. After that she ended up yelling about something or other but my friend and I just walked out ecause of how offensive she was. If she wasn't there, the full experience would've been much more enjoyable.",1
"Just finished a move with these guys in town. It was ok. The price per hour is higher than I would expect but at least they are insured and take care of stuff. I had some wood pieces that were damaged, they took them and repaired them no questions asked. n nHowever, I have a beef with the teardown assembly portion of the move. They took my king bed apart which was fine, but the re assemble was basically all wrong. They forgot a piece, stripped some screws, and what they did put together was not properly aligned. When I pointed this out, they said their handyman would call me. It's been two weeks and counting, no call. note did eventually call . n nI had to take the whole thing apart, fix it, put it back together which was a 90 minute job. So I was not happy about that. So overall pretty good but since they cost top dollar I expected top service and it fell a little short. To be sure I probably would use them again though.",2
"Artie is our lifetime plumber! He's great! We've had him replace faucets, toilets, etc. all the work he's done has been excellent. Everything's working great everything looks great! On top of that, the bills we've received from him haven't had any surprises his quotes were accurate. I'd highly recommend Artie. We'll use him for all of our plumbing needs.",2
"First let me state that the only reason I am deducting a star is because I didn't like the entree that I ordered, but due to the fact that the quality of the food was great I would return to try a different entree on the menu. I also really enjoyed their lettuce wraps, so that would bring me back again. n nThe service here is amazing! Our waitress, I believe her name was Ashley cute blonde girl did a fantastic job! She was professional, knowledgeable, and personable. The manager was also great. He came to see how everything was, gave us a coupon and invited us back. n nThe atmosphere was very modern, cute, laid back and fun. n nI really enjoyed my experience here and as I stated previously, I would return to try something different on the menu! ",2
"This is already a place where the staff knows names of people coming in for a hot breakfast I observed it this morning. Demographics are mostly middle aged to retired folks, with the latter having a good time exchanging quips with their server. n nSizable outdoor seating exists here as well as good room inside with rather modern decor, including a curved bar for solo patrons looking for a quick breakfast. Background music was on the quiet side. n nI enjoyed my 2 egg breakfast with hash browns English muffin. Pancakes were just alright though. On the menu the omelettes sounded good, as well as some of the vegan options made with tofu and assorted veggies. Breakfast served all day so I know I'll take advantage of that. n nUpdate Service has gone downhill on recent visits. Attitude issues from server for no good reason.",1
"At least the sheets were clean. But this place seems like it exists for the two race weeks of the year. The upholstered chair in the room had multiple stains, the top cover of the toilet was cracked and the tile in the bathroom was in bad shape. The complementary breakfast was coffee with creamora instead of half half , cereal, and toaster waffles. If you like being lulled to sleep with hiway noise, you will love it. The price was low but you get what you pay for.",1
"Not really sure what all the hype is about here. Sure they have a lot of different options to choose from but I'd prefer quality over quantity. The potato pancakes were a pleather of nothing but grease and bland flavor. The stuffed cabbage, well Let's just not even talk about that. I don't want to sound mean but this just isn't the real deal. A lot of people have the misconception that if it's in the strip, it has to be good. I think you have to truly know what something is supposed to taste like before you can say it's great. Just my opinion though. Not impressed or satisfied and probably won't return sorry",1
"The food is average. But if your making a reservation for 10 or more, they make you put a credit card down for the reservation and do prix fix menus. We made a reservation for 14 but one got sick and only 13 showed up. We got the bill and they charged us for 14 dinners at 45 a pop . Manager said we were contracted for 14 and it doesnt matter how many actually showed up and would not fix the bill. We ended up splitting the extra dinner and with 2 beers person our total was 75 each for average mexican food! Ended up making them give us the entree to go and found a homeless person across the street to give the food to.",1
"We stopped here for a quick lunch after doing some errands and shopping. The restaurants was pretty empty with two other patrons there besides us. The restaurant was clean and well kept, and the decor was much more subdued and classier than some of the other Hawaiian restaurants in town. We ordered two different combination plates with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. The chicken was thin and dry, and unfortunately the highlight of the meal. I couldn't stomach the beef as it had a very distinct, off putting, odor to it. The pork was also dry and had an off putting smell. I did not want to chance a food poisoning so I just ate the chicken and rice. The macaroni salad tasted like it had been marinaded in a cleaning solution. The price is fair for the amount of food you get, but in this case I would opt for quality over quantity. I don't plan on coming back.",1
"Pet Club carries a wide variety of food for dogs and cats. If you want low end food, go elsewhere. They specialize in mid to high end products don't believe the other reviewer she got it wrong . They also carry food for birds, rodents, and horses, but I can't vouch for their selection for these animals. The prices are fantastic bagged food is always several dollars cheaper than Petco Petsmart, and canned food is sometimes as much as a dollar cheaper per can. Pet Club staff are far more knowledgable about pet nutrition and food options than the big stores. n nEven though they specialize in food, Pet Club carries a selection of supplies other than food, such as collars, leashes, grooming products, bowls, beds, toys, cat trees, and treats. It's not huge, but there's enough variety for most people. FInally, there is no actual club no membership is required. n nThis location is small and cramped the majority of the location is warehouse for inventory and not particularly clean, but the service and quality of product is great. Skip the narrow parking lot and park on the east side of the building but don't worry they'll happily carry everything to your car for you. Pets welcome.",2
"I just recently switched from Cox to CenturyLink due to the availability of PrismTV IPTV powered by MediaRoom in my area of Chandler. We got the Complete package with DVR plus phone and internet. The TV doesn't live up to the hype of the sales man you can't watch over the web at home and can't access the DVR from computers at least as far as I have figured out yet but the service is good. n nTV none of the lag of Cox digital. The channels change fast, no pixelation at our house and On Demand has always worked on demand. Cox was giving us lag, pixelation and sound that lagged this was the biggest reason for the switch n nPhone great no complaints. n nInternet the installation was a pain, the guy needed access to the attic and had to cut a hole in the wall fortunately we had CAT5 cable in the house or it would have been worse . I almost cancelled the switch but since we had CAT 5 it worked out ok. The router modem combo seems really solid. We are running 9 devices with no problems so far. The speed tests don't seem great speedtest.net but the games my kids play work well, movies on netflix stream great and webpages load quickly pings are fast . n nSales pitch some kid came around with no documentation, no cards, a lot of hype and little detail. I did some research on my own and the kid came back a few times and we finally decided to make the switch. If you are in the Chandler area it is worth a try if it is offered. n nBottom line we are only a few days into it but no regrets so far. If you don't give this a negative update in the next few weeks you will know we are still happy.",2
"Waiting in line for 5 minutes because the guys in front of me were messing around and taking an exceptionally long time to pay. When I got up, the cashier said that he already gave my tee time away. I pointed out that it was 8 43 and we were set for 8 41 and gestured to the goofballs in front of me as the cause for being tardy. Didn't care. I complained to the Starter. The Starter said too bad. You can go to any of the other 100 courses and play without jerks, a maybe even a driving range. I'm never going back.",1
"I do not recommend this nail salon. I had gel nails done with white tips. They were so bad that I went back the next day to have them redone. They still weren't as good as they should be but I just said I'd never go back. I do have a picture, but I'm not sure it shows how bad they were. The white tips lines were not strait.",1
"Outstanding authentic Chinese in Madison. Had lunch with my family and was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Madison. Many Chinese dishes you can not find in a typical ""Americanized "" restaurant. High quality food and generous portions good for sharing. Keep in mind when the menu indicates spicey they mean it by Asian standards. Dumplings, chicken, fish and noodle dishes were all excellent. Highly recommended if you like authentic Chinese. I think other reviews with low ratings were expecting American chop suey type Chinese.",2
"Let me start by saying that this place takes a lot of pride in their bakery items. All their pastries look so perfect in their display window, that it seems such a shame to eat them. The portion size is small, but I will come back and try one of their pastries so other time. Today, I was just there with one thing in mind, a crepe. I ordered the banana and chocolate crepe with green tea ice cream inside. Although I am not an expert in crepes, I felt that this crepe was made a little too thick and was not crispy at all. I just remembered how wonderful Marion Crepes was when I was in Tokyo's Harajuku Takeshita dori and I am a little disappointed with this one. The first crepe they tried to make on the griddle didn't turn out, so they had to start all over. There is quite the technique to make the perfect crepe, and obviously the first crepe did not pass their quality control. It looked okay to me. I felt like saying to her, it's okay, I will eat it anyway. But like I said before, they are perfectionist at their craft. The finish product looked great. The crepe batter was quite tasty, and the combination of flavours wasn't bad. I just wished that the crepe was a little more crispy and thin. I will return, and try one of their delightful looking pastries even though it looks to picture perfect to eat.",2
Moved here from Chicago and finally found my nail spa! Had the no chip gel manicured and I'm on day 15. Love it!,2
"My wife and I stopped in yesterday. It was nice to be back in the area. Their pizza is as good as it gets their salads are awesome too! I loved the Founder's smoked porter.the scotch ale by House of Brews not so much. Adam and Dave are uniquely different bartenders, but both kick ass in their own unique ways. ",2
A nice place. I came in with extremely short nails. ok I bite them. I asked the technician if I could get a manicure or do I have to get a full set of nails. She didn't try to upsell me a full set. nThe place was clean and the staff was friendly. And the price is extremely reasonable. I would totally come back again.,2
"I'm new to this area and needed my mexican food fix because Cinco de Mayo was on my mind. This place is AOK in my book. Staff was very friendly, salsa bar was nice and cold, place was clean. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito w everything.which is rice, beans, cheese, pico, guac and sour cream. Then I made it green sauce enchilada style.what do I know I'm a yankee. It was big, affordable and most importantly tasty! They gave me some chips to dip while I waited. My salsa bar favs were the gaucamole salsa and the spicy I added salt . I'll be back. nMari crapa as I call it, is lucky to have a place like this.",2
"In the past year this Company has trended down in overall service. A recent sedan picking me up on advance reservation, had a defective rear passenger window and marginal air conditioning. The driver seemed new and stopped the car to call dispatch regarding a low fuel gauge. No one seemed to know if the car had a faulty gauge or was truly empty. As the outside temperature hit 105 , I was uneasy being faced with possible out of gas scenario in afternoon traffic. We made it to my drop off, but it's just nNot in the very good ranking anymore.",1
"So this is a family restaurant that has been in Las Vegas since 1969 and has some food options that can't be found anywhere else in Las Vegas. The nameless, homemade noodle soup with cheese is out of this world. The salsa is homemade and they have two options, one that is hot and one that is more of a chunky salsa, the chips are also homemade and delicious. They also offer lots of different options, with mix and match dinner entrees as well. n nBottom line, you will never satisfy everyone on any aspect but I support family run and small businesses not to mention Las Vegas locals. n nThe margaritas also are hand poured and are divine. So try it, trust me, you will like it!",2
Worst Passport service. More like NO service at all for people sending Passport documentations.,1
"Food is top, servers are amazing. Even the music was ambient and perfect for the location. Until one day the owner was there. He kept staring at us which was rude and when we asked to take out the rest if the food he gave us an aluminum foil and attitude. Lost 2 regulars there.",1
"If you are from out of town, do not come here. The fact that a suggestion by a male clerk who initially said my insurance was a no go in his office then suggested that I call my insurance to make sure I will be covered left a bad taste in my mouth . I went to this place because of their 4 rating on yelp. I left the office without being checked out. I know for a fact that my insurance should have been accepted because I call my provider after I left. I believe that's why they have insurance specialist working for them. Or do they?FYI if you are going to talk about someone's insurance statues. Make sure other people don't hear the conversations u are having with the patient or the other clerks comments about a patients insurance status. Very unprofessional .",1
"This may sound silly, but in the 2 nights I was in Vegas I got overcharged THREE TIMES with false tips. It started here at Ciao Ciao. First of all, the water I purchased here was already 4.99, but when I got home I saw that the woman at the register must have added 1 to the tip line, which means I paid 5.99 for a bottle of water. As a former server, I always give at least a 20 tip on meals or a 1 per alcoholic drink, but never a 1 tip for a water I buy at a stand! I frequent Vegas several times a year and I will NEVER go back here. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Ugh.",1
Love the local 30 M Th. The bathrooms could use a little extra TLC but the services and sauna were great. Will definitely go again!,2
"This place really has lots of potential, but it seems they are just letting it fall apart. n nThe door locks need serious maintenance. I'm not exaggerating when I say I stood in the hallway for 15 minutes trying to get the reader to recognize the key before it let me into the room! n nInexpensive, but you get what you pay for.just spend the extra 5 10 a night and stay at the Luxor next door! Even if you have kids, I'm sure they'll love the ""Pyramid "" hotel just as much as ""The Castle "" one!",1
"I would put negative star if available. The workers their are so rude ave are not costumer friendly. Not to mention they don't even know their own merchandise. There's a little crazy foreign last who works in their dressing room who needs to be fired. Rudest old lady ever! Their management needs to be replaced, if their employees can treat people like that. I hate shopping there but when your on a budget, you have no other choice. Thumbs down twice!",1
"I am a frequent BBW shopper for their home scents. I will not return to this location even though it's most convenient . What happened to customer service? I missed a sale by hours and ""Kevin "" refused to honor it for me. I know this is possible but instead he took my shopping bag and let me leave the store empty handed. I felt like a child being scolded! I happily went to the Scottsdale quarter and they honored the sale for me. Do the right thing people!",1
"Also known as stab mart in the military circle this Walmart is not the best by any means. However, I must admit with the increase of security recently it has made me comfortable with once again shopping there. nIt has been a welcome change to not have to travel all the way down Craig to the next Walmart to buy things. n nThis Walmart does offer some things that other Walmarts' do not normally offer. In example, around holiday times and season changes you can snag some great clearance items. They almost always have some kind of clearance specials going on in buggies along the backside of the cashier stations and have a clearance aisle behind the jewelry department. n nA couple of downsides to this Walmart is that the service is very limited. They have minimum cashiers and their deli department always takes forever to service you. However, the service you get is rarely bad once you get it. The people tend to be friendly. n nI would also never recommend buying produce there. Their fruits and vegetables go bad super quick. During strawberry season I purchased two large flats of strawberries for a dessert I was making. The next day when I opened my 2 flats I found that 90 of my strawberries were ruined and molded toward the bottom. I had looked the day before and had not seen this. I have also had this issue with some of the bread products I have bought there so beware on fresh products. n nOverall, this Walmart could be better. There are some things such as cleanliness that could still be improved but in the 3 years I have lived in the area I have seen major improvements to what it was previously.",1
"Worst cold Italian sandwich ever. 3 pieces of thin meat with a thick, cold bun. Waste of 8. Good ranch dressing though.",1
"I've been in this store multiple times and only once has any of the staff approached me and asked me if I needed any help. Yet I've stood there and watched as they approached other people, within seconds, who came in after me and asked if they needed anything. n nI just left the store and stood there for about 15 minutes waiting on my wife to shop. Only 1 person said anything to us, and that was only after being in the store 5 minutes.",1
"The food here is okay only because Pittsburgh lacks a lot of really good Chinese restaurants. Place is kind of expensive, especially since the cost of the ingredients they need to make the kind of food they make is pretty cheap. But I guess you can apply that to many of the Chinese restaurants here. n nJellyfish Salad Probably one of my favorite things here. Like the garlicy taste but again really expensive. Don't think the small plate is worth 8. n nFive spiced Eggplant Also liked this one. Sauce is kind of ketchupy and vinegary. n nBraised Beef Noodle Soup Beef is really delicious, tender, and flavorful. Soup is kind of flavorless. Doesn't have the ""Beef Noodle Soup "" taste like ones in Taiwan. Had this twice. The first time the noodles were overcooked. Second time they were better and were more QQ. n nBraised Minced Pork over Rice Tastes like how I make it except has no ginger or shallot flavor, so pretty good. n nDandan noodles This did not taste good. Was not spicy and tasted like peanut butter and vinegar? n nZha jiang mian My favorite thing there. The sauce and meat are delicious. n nI never had their Xiao Long Bao, but my sister said the frozen ones you buy at the Asian supermarket taste better.",2
"I have been to many Whole Foods before.They are all the same.fancy, great choices, and unique foods. Here's the problem I have a 5 star taste on a fast food budget. I love great food! Nothing is better than the finest. I think we all have a sweet spot for it.I walk in to this new one on the way home and WOW! More food and even more choices.They even sell shoes there! Yes, shoes! nThe produce was wonderful, the fruit delectable and the cheese out of this world! I could eat everything in sight.I barely got out of there with three kinds of cheese. I could have left with ten! nThis Whole Foods, which is in very north Scottsdale, has one upped the others in true Scottsdale fashion.Adding more choices, more stations oh god, the olive bar! , and more gluten free products than I've ever seen. nTo wrap things up, here is the reason why it only gets four stars. nThe prices! My palette deserves these tastes, but just a bit cheaper.Help!",2
The food is awesome! Try the Philly Pita and Fries or the chicken and rice meal with salad and pita. It is really good. The place is clean and the people super friendly. You can't go wrong here.,2
"I am a super, anal clean freak until I started my own business and have no time to clean my own house. In the meantime, I've never kept a relationship with any cleaning service, because they never cleaned to my standards, until I met Jorge and Dina of Check Maid. n nI decided to give Check Maid a try since there was a yelp offer. It was nice to make an appointment online, but there was no place to put the yelp offer code in, so I had to search for a working Check Maid phone number to have that corrected. Needless to say, I am not a fan of Check Maid corporate, because they are intentionally illusive by not posting their main number, but if you need it , it is 1 800 737 4802. However, Dina and Jorge, our local Check Maid cleaners, I am a fan of! They are professional, on time, and efficient. I have a large home and though they would never finish in 4 hours, especially for the initial cleaning, but they did! They cleaned every nook and cranny like the baseboards, windowsills, and floor corners. n nRest assured, Dina and Gorge speak clear English. They exceeded my high expectations, and I liked that they asked me to do a visual inspection of their cleaning, and to let them know if there is anything that that did not meet my standards, so they could fix it to my satisfaction. They need minimal supervision and will clean your home beyond your expectations! n nYou will not be disappointed in Dina and Gorge's cleaning!",2
"we came in late ish one rainy evening for dinner, after a friend highly recommended it. the place was virtually empty but it still took ages for us to be seated. n ni ordered the grilled lobster, shrimp and crab enchiladas and was fairly disappointed by the lack of flavor. i don't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but he had a similar issue with his dish. the service was extra slow during our whole meal, and the waitress didn't even bother to refill my water. n nfor the price, you should definitely get better food and service.",1
"I absolute LOVE Tonic II Salon! I've been getting my hair cut by Bonnie for over a year now, and she always does an amazing job! She's really great at listening to what I want, and then telling me how the cut will change the way I have to style my hair. The salon is always clean and the staff is always very friendly.",2
"I have since stopped going to this cleaners. This is nothing negative towards the employees that process the orders but the location that does the dry cleaning. On too many occasions now, my shirts have come back in less then stellar condition. They started coming with creases and broken buttons. I don't have the time to send shirts back to be repaired and pressed again. I would suggest finding another cleaner. And to the cleaners, it may be time to do some quality assurance at your factory.",1
No brown rice. Almost no vegetarian options.,1
Their vegan dark chocolate is exceptional! I savor each piece and love to gift it or receive it as a gift! Wonderful special little chocolates anyone would adore. c ,2
"Our waiter was very rude to us. Interrupted us impatiently when we tried to order our meals. The food was very bad, I had the bland and dry fish tacos and my friend had a chicken wrap where the fat hadn't been rendered properly so it was just disgusting. They obviously don't care about the quality of their food here. And considering their prices, I would never come back again. Avoid at all cost.",1
"We were pleased to find a Thai Restaurant in Surprise. We lived in Seattle before retiring to Arizona and have eaten at many Thai Restaurants there. Tom Yum is right up there with the best. Tom Yum soup is the best. Have been there 4 times in the last two weeks and have tried almost everything they have on the menu and all has been very good. Only reason they don't get a 5 is the service and ordering of food needs a little tweaking, which they must fix or no matter how good the food is they will lose customers.",2
"Get up, go downtown and eat here!",2
"I really, really liked this place. Great tacos, amazing prices, nice staff. I went 3 times and loved it! n nUNTIL. n nI was waiting at the bar and saw that they recycle the salsa. Meaning, they put 3 pots of salsa on your table for your tacos. When you're done eating and dipping your fork into these the pots , the salsa bowls go back to the ledge between seating and kitchen, they top up the bowls and re serve to other tables. Meaning, you are served the same salsa that other people were dipping into. n nI witnessed this happening consistently for 30 minutes, I would not make these allegations unless I was certain. That just turns my stomach! Isn't this against health codes? I can't go back knowing what I know. n nIf they stop recycling their salsa which was yummy salsa , I'll be back in a second AND I'll delete this review. I'll write a 4 5 start rating instead, because that's what the place deserves. Deal?",1
"We came here at the recommendation of a friend who lives in Vegas after mentioning wanting to go to Nobu for dinner. I'm from NY and like the Nobu location there . The decor is adequate, but the music was really odd for a restaurant one of the first songs we heard was about eating pussy and there were many songs with the n word. I expect that while I'm at the club, but while I'm eating? Completely tasteless! n nThe service was lacking but not the worst I've seen. At one point the waitress came over to check the amount of wine left in the bottle, then set it down and walked away even though two of our glasses were empty! The food came out very slowly, but that's typical of an all you can eat place, where they want you to fill up in between courses and order less. n nThe food itself was extremely disappointing. Most of the rolls had ingredients that are never in real sushi cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and other odd things. They were presented attractively but were drenched in cream sauces and the ones that were fried were disgustingly greasy. The fish was fresh enough but not even close to the quality I'm used to. n nI guess if you've never had really high quality sushi you might enjoy this place judging from other reviewers but if you appreciate only the best sushi, you'll probably want to skip Oyshi. I definitely won't go back!",1
"Cilantro lime hummus? bomb! fish and chips? F ing fantastic!Beer? two thumbs up! Atmosphere? very chill.love the setup! Service? good considering the poor thing was basically running the whole area by herself, but still had a smile each time we waved her down for some help. n nGreat find.i will be checking in here soon.",2
"First, this isn't about the food. nI made my reservation for this restaurant about a month before on their website. An hour before the reservation I decided to call them just to confirm the reservation and they don't have it! They said the restaurant has a private party. I was so bummed out. If they had a private party they should have called to let me know or blocked reservations from coming through on their site. I expressed my discontent on the phone but they didn't seem to care.",1
"For the price my just warm baked cod was okay but had little taste sitting in water. Sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine. Waitress Amber was courteous and attentive. I enjoyed dinner until our party of 5 was asked to leave because they needed the table. Really? We were quite dismayed and told the male cashier whose response was defensive and frankly, rude. He even said if he were here co owner Al would have asked us to leave just as the other co owner did tonight. Wow. If true I am disappointed, Al. Your staff just lost us as customers including the other party waiting in line who walked out after us upon hearing our complaint and the cashier's response. Boo, bad customer service and not worth the food.",1
"NOT a CHAIN RESTAURANT! nAmazing Unique Food! Stellar Service! nFabulous Bar Wine Service. nTry the Grilled Asparagus with Candied Bacon! Delish! We also ordered the Grilled Octopus with Chick Peas and Lemon which has a unique layer of flavors and brightness. nWe tried the Squid Ink Pasta and Seared Scallops and couldnt believe the flavors that the charming and polite Chef Gio can incorporate into these marvelous dishes! nAfterwards we tried every single dessert on the menu, courtesy of Chef Gio. Not sure how we got so lucky that night! I honestly couldnt choose a favorite because they were all so delicious! They were definitely worth the calories! The cremes and cakes and ice creams were probably the best I have ever tasted in any of my travels. nWould I go back? In a heartbeat! This is hands down the best restaurant in the state!",2
"I can't recommend this hotel for 1.

"To all who read this please head this warning and DO NOT EAT HERE. BEWARE.I read a few reviews on here before visiting and disregarded the negative reviews.

"This place is overrated by some, and overpriced given the quality. Starter Salsa is runny and bland. So called ""steak "" is the thinnest piece of beef I've had in a restaurant. Food presentation is non existent. If this is called ""authentic "" Mexican food, it really is a humiliation to Mexican cuisine. If you don't want to feel ripped off and still hungary after eating there, pls stay away and save the regret!",1
"We booked The Cancun via Expedia. Don't believe the ratings on Expedia as I did and made reservations for my family. I was deceived by Expedia's positive reviews. The Cancun is a time share! The room was dirty, dingy and requires repair and updates. There were stains on the carpet, broken furniture including missing handles on drawers, etc. . I found a used soap w hair in the master bathroom! My two young daughters found a wad of blonde hair when they picked up the hair dryer. There was gum on the ceiling! If you and stains on the floor. If you decide to stay at this hotel, make sure to bring your own toiletries strangely enough, The Cancun provided two shower gels, one conditioner and a lotion, but no shampoo. I thought perhaps the cleaning crew made a mistake and provided two shower gels and forgot the shampoo but the other bathroom was the same way . The pool had large groups of people many were drinking alcohol and left bottles and plastic cups around the pool. Beware if you have a family which utilizes electronic devices w wifi only two devices are allowed wifi for free and there is an additional charge for every device thereafter. Also, there was limited parking near your room. I would not recommend this hotel. We didn't even stay the night. I found another hotel and left. I called Expedia to advise the situation, but they would only provide 50 of Expedia credit to use in the future. I wouldn't recommend Expedia either. We lost appx. 450 400 w credit I don't normally write reviews, but didn't want another family to get ""tricked "" and lose money like we did. To top it off, after check in they send you over to the ""Do you have time to listen to our presentation "", they will try to sell you a timeshare!",1
"So we had heard that The Counter had the best burgers ever. I'm a fan of burgers, and though we aren't in the South Park area often, we had passed by often enough to make me want to make a special trip by to check it out. n nThe menu alone just about had my mouth watering. Pencil in hand, it was all I could do to contain myself and figure out just what I was going to order. That was actually the start of the problem. n nThough McDonald's may not have the best quality in the world, they make up for it by telling you just what you can get. They make it easy for you by not making it too hard on the brain, and they also give you great pictures. n nThe Counter could go a long way by putting up some pictures of employee creations something like the pre made concoctions that they do at Cold Stone Creamery. That way you would at last have some ideas, rather than giving you all this burger overload that is so intimidating. And yes, they had a burger of the month which I ordered, and wasn't bad , but they need more than one such option. n nAfter giving in and figuring out what might work, we sat down and waited. And waited. And waited. Horrible, really, considering that we were the only people in there on a weekday afternoon. I will never comprehend how restaurants cannot serve two people when no one is there, nor can they serve hundreds of people when its packed. It's like they just don't want to do their job. n nIn any case, we also ordered a ""hobo pack "" of grilled vegetables. It would have been better to get a can of mixed vegetables from the grocery store and eat them raw. From the can. It was one of the worst things we have ever eaten. n nThe burgers finally arrived, and they were. average. A lot of it was certainly perception, having been built up in our mind that we would experience something great. Then we had to wait, all the while eating from this hobo pack, perhaps prepared by an actual hobo who probably has higher standards, so I insult hobos around the world, and that is not my intention . n nNext time, we'll go to Five Guys. Or McDonald's. And just take a menu from The Counter to enjoy.",1

"As noted before. This place is ""apparently "" great for weddings. As for golfers, I booked this trip coming from PA for a business trip and was told I was allowed to brings alcoholic drinks and they would provide cooler and ice. As we arrived we were quickly told no outside food or drinks were permitted. Beers are 6 9 which is unfortunate as we did not see the drink cart ONCE in our 4 1 2 hour round. The accommodations were horrendous as well as the rude employes who worked there. If I could give ZERO stars I would. DO NOT RECCOMEND",1
Don't stay here. You have to carry your own luggage up the stairs. No elevator. Staff not helpful at all.,1
My favorite coffee shop in Phoenix! Small and intimate with a beautiful dog friendly patio. The staff is so nice and helpful. They always have the highest excellence of coffee and pastries. Love all the Staff here. Such a comfortable great place My favorite is their Carmel macchiato! Oh and they have almond milk!,2
"We were invited to the Mt. Washington Business District for an evening with family and were taken to Difiore's Ice Cream Delite for dessert. Having a 3yo and 5yo made the experience all the better they were thrilled at the choice of ice cream cones. They had plain, chocolate sprinkles and rainbow sprinkles. The best part of the experience was finding something on the menu for our three year old that is lactose intolerant. It is nice not having to give her medicine or to have her opt out. n nThe service was warm and welcoming and we look forward to visiting again. The kids are already asking for the ice cream shop near the skyline!",2
"Maybe 3.5 stars, here's my lowdown. nNice folks. Very meaty pulled pork. Great bacon though pretty strong smoke and salt flavor, that's a personal preference. Lean and tasty kielbasa. Pain the butt to purchase Sundays only 12 noon 3pm . OK make it 4.5 stars. What else can you say about someone so damn dedicated and passionate that you can buy locally smoked and cured bacon? High five ACS!",2
Best meal I've had in Vegas . Freshly prepared soup with local veggies and an amazing tofu scramble wrap. Perfect flavors . Really impressed with this place!,2
"Another place I'd like to give a negative star review. n nFor starters, the lanes have entirely too much oil. I mean like, my ball towel was saturated before the night was over, and I didn't even play 3 entire games. n nWe were there sure a fundraiser, and entry was to include a pizza, and a pitcher of soda. n nRealizing most of the other bowlers had already received, and consumed their pies, I inquired as to the location of ours, only to be informed that it had already been brought. Funny, nobody told me, or my hungry children. n nThe manager seemed quite displeased to be asked to provide us the pizza we were owed, and finally, begrudgingly, brought three measly slices. I asked if that was all we got, and he said ""All the pizza have been brought out "" n nDude, we DIDN'T GET OURS! n nWhatever, they were just barely doing what they had to. n nI would never voluntarily return there on my own, but I would probably go back if I was invited there. n nFor the record, I prefer Brunswick lanes over AMF, and I prefer small establishments, rather than large corporate ventures.",1
"Awesome dive bar. It is what it is if you're seeking fancy Vegas stuff, this is not the place for you. If you want to check out a little punk rock bar off the beaten path, then I recommend stopping in for some beers checking out some bands if anyone is playing! Open 24 hours. They have some video slot machines. They also sell cigarettes, and ""ass juice "", which is suprisingly delicious!",2
"Unfortunately, I have not tried the food at Biscuits due to the website having the incorrect hours listed. I got a recommendation from a friend and was really looking forward to trying the home cooking. I called in for a pick up order on Saturday at 2 15 and was informed that the restaurant was closed. The hours on the menu and elsewhere list that the restaurant is open until 3pm on Saturday and Sunday. Please correct this.",1
This was a forgettable show. It's like all the rejected stunts from the other Cirque du Soleil shows all rolled into one big disjointed mess. If you've seen other Cirque du Soleil shows you've already seen Zarkana. Skip it. Good thing our tickets were free.,1
"This store seems nice, but a manager or supervisor I spoke to about looking for an item I was looking for was beyond rude! I noticed he was spelling it wrong so I asked him to search again using the correct spelling. I was told "" sir, your wrong. Do you even know how to spell what your looking for ""? Then he walked away without any resolution to my situation. I was clearly an inconvenience to his day and he made that clear. I would much rather go to best buy for my item and pay more.",1
"5 stars for service and 2 stars for the food. I was hoping to try authentic okinawan food and left disappointed. n nI don't recommend ordering sashimi or sushi here as the quality of the fish is mediocre. My husband enjoyed their simple salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy scallop rolls. Yellowtail sashimi was not good. n nAlso tried the shishito peppers and garlic tofu which were good. Last was the okinawan soba noodles itself was great but the broth and pork belly kind of tough and extremely bland. n nI honestly think if they increased the quality of the produce and corrected the seasonings, they will have more business since their service is fantastic.",1
"I called to schedule a deep tissue massage and the receptionist told me this wouldn't be a problem. The massage therapist is probably in her mid to late 50's and does not have the strength to perform deep tissue. She may be fine giving other types of massages but I felt this was false advertising. I honestly couldn't wait for the massage to be over from the moment it started and I realize I should have gotten up and walked out.yeah the massage was that bad. The therapist also had a bad odor, like cigarettes. I got a bad vibe about the place the moment I walked in. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere.",1
"Here is my story, sad but true. A few weeks ago I was scouring ram dealerships for a RAM 2500 4x4 6.7L crew cab, and found the perfect one at airpark dodge. So I submitted an inquiry and was answered by a fellow by the name of Ian Jones. After a few back and forth emails, he asked me if I had a trade in, which I did. As I didn't have the VIN memorized I sent him a direct link to my trade in as advertised on autotrader.com. In the spirit of full disclosure, I also sent him a link to some search results of similar vehicles, to help inform ian of my expected trade in allowance. n n After some time I received an email back stating that they would give me a very fair price on my trade in. Excited, I started on the path towards ownership of the new truck. Several emails were exchanged all leading up to the day of delivery. n n We live in Southern California and the dealership is located in Scottsdale, north of PHX, which is about a 11 hour drive, round trip. As you can see, I was quite serious about purchasing the truck because they offered a generous trade in allowance, and they had the one I wanted. n n On Sunday my wife and I set out on our journey, during which we had a lot of fun. The drive to PHX from SoCal is scenic and made for a quick trip. Upon arrival at the dealership we met ian and he showed us the new truck, it was magnificent, even better in person. So after a few minutes of inspection we walked over to the trade in, and ian took down the vin. Then it happened, pretty much the worse thing a salesperson can say during a vehicle purchase ""I thought you had a silver 09? "". At first I thought he was joking, to think otherwise is silly, but he reassured me he was quite serious. It was at this time my stomach bottomed out and an ugly feeling came over me. n n Rather than cause a scene, I casually strolled inside to wait for ian and the sales manager to hash out whatever they needed to discuss. During this time I re read the email thread with the link to my trade in. Fortunately for me, the link was to my EXACT trade in, not some silver version of it, so the fault fell squarely on ian. His defense was that there were multiple vehicles in the link which there were not , and if this were the case, why didn't he ask me to identify which one was mine? n n About 10 minutes later ian came back to us and said the most they could give me was 10K less than what was agreed upon. Even though I could have still done the deal, I was disgusted with their handling of the situation and couldn't even give them money for the snack machine. What made the situation worse was that ians apologies really didn't seem sincere, and there was no offerings of remorse by the dealership like maybe a gas card, something that says ""ya we messed up, let us at least cover your gas back home "". As ian tried to explain the reason for his mistake, I posed the question ""What would you do if you were in my shoes? "", he replied ""I would probably leave "", so I did. n n It was one of the hardest trips home I ever took. Was extremely bummed out, but fortunately for me, my loving wife helped keep me in good spirits and we tried to salvage the trip. n n As I write this and relive a terrible situation, I can't help but feel if maybe I were scammed? That they thought I would LOVE the truck so much, and the drive was so far, that to drive back home in my old vehicle would not even be an option. n n Anyway, stay away, far away. Plus PHX has another RAM dealer, which has to be at least one step above airpark.",1
"This Paradise seems to do better than they were a few years ago in friendliness of staff as well as food quality. In fact, they may be comparable to the Shea Tatum location. Regardless, gotta love the Chicken Walnut Sandwiches on sourdough and their chocolate chip cookies.",2
"Food 5 5 Local Loaf, obviously, bakes all kinds of fresh bread every day. They better when they have the word ""loaf "" in their name, haha. Sometimes, I don't even go there to order lunch. I just get a few baguettes to go and call it a day. Other than the bread which really is the backbone of every sandwich , they do a phenomenal job of creating fresh and unique sandwiches. The Steak Sandwich is the one that really stands out for me. Nice succulent cuts of beef, some sprouts, and perfect amount of homemade horseradish spread. D.licious! Oh yeah, homemade chips or cucumber salad with every sandwich, too! They really do an excellent job of not over extending themselves and trying to create a crazy complex menu. Sweet and simple maybe ten things on there bfast lunch . n nAtmosphere 5 5 It is located in the 7th Street Public Market in the corner nearest to the 7th street entrance.

"Went there for the first time last Saturday. While the beer menu is impressive, being out of a couple of beers I wanted to try doesn't help. And our waitress, while cute and helpful, was new, so she needed our help in getting the right beers ordered. n nWe then ordered food. My GF's ""Rocket Tots "" were tasty, although she only got like. 14 of them for 6.99 so it wasn't a good value at all. I ordered a burger, which was the worst I've had since I moved to Charlotte in 2003. The meat had a sour, ""off "" taste, and the meat was cooked within an inch of its life. It was so dry that it was impossible to eat without liquid. What's more, I ordered it with Red Dragon cheese and extra 1 , and it was a depressing, congealed mass on top. The 9 fries that came with the meal were served at a less than ideal temp, but were nice and salty in spite of this. n nThe bottom line is that the waitresses are cute and in skimpy outfits, and the beer selection is good. But if you want to go here, eat somewhere else before you come. nI'm also literally offended that the Flying Saucer charges 99 u00a2 for their iPhone and Android apps. but that is neither here nor there.",1
"This was my first time at the Square Cafe and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered the Hoppin Johnny which consisted of black eyed peas, rice, sauteed onions and peppers, greens topped off with two eggs over easy. It was delicious and completely unique in comparison to what I'm used to. The one thing I didn't like was how crowded the cafe was. However, I rather it be crowded so I know it's definitely worth the time and money than empty and a bit skeevy. n nTo sum it up, it's a great place to get breakfast brunch and I'll definitely go back sometime soon.",2
"I'm really confused by the whole ordering situation with this company. I wanted to place an order just now, Sunday at 1pm. My girlfriend calls 602 508 0444 twice, both times it just rings without pick up or voicemail. On the third attempt a voicemail prompts that if we would like to place an order, to do so either online or via email. Online they have a message alerting, ""Online ordering will be back soon, please call to order. "" Our only option now is to email our order which right away does not give me confidence that it will be handled correctly if at all and my confidence was further diminished when I realize I'm emailing some cox.net email. In my email I request a response for confirmation of receipt. After 20 minutes nothing. Just as I suspected. I can't understand how you can run a business like this. I took my business to Rosati's on Arcadia, a much more pleasant experience where someone actually answered the phone and took our order. n nPS It's also a bit embarrassing for this company to have their first yelp pic be of a hair in their food. I'd blame their PR person for not addressing it but doubt this company is that dynamic given their basic website and professional cox email account.",1
"I was on a guestlist courtesy of my fellow Yelpers who steered me to http www.freevegasclubpasses.com . Voodoo lounge was what they suggested for the first night in Vegas, so I taxied my way over from the strip like 10 from the Palazzo . n nYou check in Masquerade Village Tower second floor and then take an elevator to the 51st floor. There is a small indoor lounge as well as a rooftop lounge. If you can brave the gusty outside you are on the roof after all! , the view of the strip is simply spectacular. I also got a free drink with my guestlist entry little did I know, it started at 11 and I got there at 10.30, but the bartender was awesome and talked to his manager for me! n nI lucked out because the night I went they had live music a cover band , but they had a DJ outside.

"I ate here for brunch on Sunday. It's 22 and you may have to roll yourself out after. It included a mimosa bloody mary, appetizer, and main plate. I had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast. All was great. They could have had some more flavorful cheeses, but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese. The bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing! I will definitely be returning for brunch!",2
The food and service are outstanding. The ambiance is that of a large old farm house and very cozy. I highly recommend this restaurant for an excellent non pretentious experience.,2

"Seemed like a nice place. However, after waiting in line for 20 minutes and taking quite a while to give our order because it was VERY loud we were told that it would take about 30 minutes to get our food. Not exactly what I wanted to hear after waiting 20 minutes but fine. When I try to pay I am informed that they do not accept debit credit cards. Cash or check only! No where on the door or while in line does it say cash or check only! There apparently is a very small sign on the register that says that but there is so much other crap posted in that area 99 of the people there probably never saw the sign. This is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards. Even worse is the BS sign on the register. I will never eat here again just because of this!",1
the bad part on travelling is have to keep on looking for a great food. nthis place isn't authentic enough to be called thai food.,1
I love holes in the wall and the food here is fantastic. I came with a group and we ordered a bunch of dishes to share. Combination platters offer a sample of everything and we got shwarma to top it all off. The gyro meat was a tad dry but all the other grilled meats and falafel were great. They are not open late so be sure to get here before they close. Prices are excellent for the amount of food you get.,2

"My wife and I stopped here on a couple of occasions during our stay at the Wynn. The first time we only wanted dessert and opted for the gelato. We've only had gelato a couple times, but this was good and very refreshing on a hot Vegas day. n nThe second time we visited we had lunch. We decided to split a caesar salad and each get a slice of their New York style pizza. Everything came out at the same time, which was find with us. The salad was chilled and the pizza was hot, both like they should be. My wife had the cheese pizza and I had the Carne pizza basically a meat lovers . They also had soups and sandwiches on the menu, but as the name says they are known for the pizza. n nThe atmosphere is very casual with about a dozen TVs. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, with the outdoor seating having a view of a waterfall and pond not the Lake of Dreams like a previous review said .",2
"Good pizza. Too pricey though. The price implies some sort of specialty, but in reality its just the same old regular NY style pizza. Garlic knots are interesting, but I think this place needs to address the pricing issue.",1

Gelato . . . Enough said.,2
"Things go well for me at lunch at Uncle Sam's. I can always find a good seat, enjoy a pint of Fat Tire with a freshly made personal sized pizza, and the wait is never long.

It's worth checking out.",2
"I was told Drybar gave a better and more long lasting blowout than Primp and Blow a blow dry competitor and so I booked an appt there at 11am before an important event from 12 3pm .

"I have to say, I think this was the perfect place for me and my other 10 girlfriends to stay in Vegas. They get minus one star for having completely screwed up our reservation when we got there. But then they get one back for having completely made up for it and treated us sort of VIP afterward. Scott the manager is amazing and we love him. r n r nOk, well I gotta break this down r n r nCasino Pretty cool. I played blackjack from about 5 am. 8 a.m. and only got 2 drinks. They need more cocktail waitresses at these wee hours of the morning I tell ya. Nevertheless, the dealers were all pretty cool. They let me sit at the table even when I wasn't playing. They let my friend and I switch off playing hands sometimes too because how else do you play blackjack for 3 hours at a 10 minimum table with only 70. They let me cut the deck too, which by the way is really fun. And each time I said, ""CUT IT DEEP! "" I didn't play any slots. Slots are for pussies. r n r nPlayboy Club This is probably a separate review, but whatever. This place kicked ass. I love when you can just march up to the front, tell them you want to go in and not pay, and they let you. It's amazing! This place overlooks the strip from the Palms hotel, has several bars, a fireplace, lots of poker tables, and Roulette which we played. All the dealers are dressed like luscious playboy bunnies. Fantastic decor I loved the bathroom with playboy pin ups all over the wall. I highly recommend this place. There is no dancing, but if you happen to find a bunch of dudes who have a table at Moon Nightclub up above the Playboy Club, GO! r n r nMoon Nightclub Since we were there pretty early, it wasn't packed, which was actually pretty cool. More room for dancing, plus free drinks from dudes from DC. This club is at the top of the new Fantasy Tower at the Palms and has a retractable ceiling. Great dance music and really cool floor set up with a large dance floor in the middle and tables all around. Not one of the top clubs in Vegas, but I'm sure it will be soon. I thought this place was really fun. r n r nPool Apparently they just redid this and it's way better. They have really cool chairs ones that go in the water, one's to lay on that have pillows, even big beds, and cabanas. Cabana girls walk around and take your drink and food order. I ordered a Bloody Mary that never came, so minus one star for that chick. They have a couple pools with loud music played by a DJ, a large hot tub that was too crowded for me to go in, and a cool waterfall. Overall, impressed, but not as cool as Mandalay Bay's pool. r n r nHotel Suites F ing awesome! Flat screens everywhere, even the bathroom. We fit comfortably 10 girls in a salon suite. Comfy robes and fabulous towels. The rooms were just really comfortable and pretty spacious. r n r nFood There is a food court with McDonald's, sub sandwiches, pizza, Panda Express and other stuff over near the movie theater. We also ate at the 24 7 Cafe which is open all night long. Saw George Maloof there. Great food and cheap eats. r n r nNove This is a nice restaurant that where we ate at the top of the Fantasy Tower of the Palms. It is right below the Playboy club. The restaurant I think is not really worth the money. I had chicken parmigana which was basically just 2 chicken breasts and sauce for 24. We also got a not so fabulous bottle of Pinot Noir for like 75. Let me tell you, Italian wines don't even begin to compare to California wines, but it was an Italian place, so they had mostly the Italian ones. My food was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. We did see a few C list famous people there. We also had some drunk guys come up to us from Pennsylvania and try and say how much they loved us. It was quite ridiculous. I was ready to get them thrown out. And some of the waiters were tools, but some were really nice and really hot. I have mixed feelings about this place, but overall it was a nice restaurant with really cool fancy chandeliers that changed color over time. r n r nOk, I'm sick of writing this review. Just go, you'll like it. r n r nHow could you NOT mark this review as useful?",2
"Ive had the most popular bobby, I didnt like it. It has all the components I liked, excited, but it didnt taste good. I ate my boyfriends cheese steak instead with the added onion, mushroom, and jalepano. It was tasty. They have three different sizes. They can come pretty large so perfect to share. We have over our many visit also tried the meatball sub but the best is still the philly. The staff is really nice, service was quick, will definitely be coming back.",2
"One word to describe my experience tonight at dinner? Blah. Nothing was special about anything I ate there. I did the restaurant week menu which, for me, included a Caesar salad, stuffed mahi mahi and creme brulee. n nThe salad was dry and could use more dressing. Wasn't the worst I've had but really nothing special. Now the mahi mahi was what I really looked forward to. Big disappointment. There was barely any flavor to this dish. While it was rich stuffing had creamy consistency , I really thought about adding salt. Yes, salt, to a seafood dish. n nTo end the experience, I ordered the Creme Brulee. Didn't think I could go wrong. It literally tasted like a snack pack pudding. It must have been pulled from a fridge and sent to the table. There was no crunchy, caramelized sugar top. Honestly, it was pudding with 2 blueberries and 1 raspberry thrown on top. n nService was also disappointing. We went on a Sunday evening and there were maybe 4 other tables taken in the whole place. After we finished our dessert we waited and waited for our server. I actually had to get up and ask another waiter to get her. n nNot sure why people love this place. I wasn't feeling it!",1
"Great place to go if you're looking for a sports bar that has more thought and effort into their menu than other sports bars. n nThey offer all the faves, Burgers, Wings, Fries, tons of drink choices always something on special it seems. But they also offer more craft options like flat bread sandwiches, pastas, and even jambalaya. n ni also love a place that has projection TVs, so you can REALLY see the game, they have three here. It's also a pretty good place to go for UFC, even though I think it's lame. Either way, if you want to chill with some good food and drink and watch some sports, check this place out. They even have a nice patio with some big screens showing all the action.",2
"The Capital Grille was a great experience overall. The staff was extremely welcoming and courteous. I had let them know it would be a first date experience and they pulled out all the stops. They chose a very romantic table setting and the service was terrific. The waiter was a little overly friendly and was a bit uncomfortable toward the end of the meal. nThe setting, environment, and welcoming staff were the highlights. For the price I felt the food could have been better. For starters we ordered mozzarella and tomato salad and the Caesar. The salads were both chilled, crisp, and the vinegar and spice balance for the mozzarella was very good. nFor the entrees we got the salmon and the special bleu cheese encrusted fillet with grilled shrimp. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but lacking on seasoning. Where they were short on flavor on the salmon they made up for on the shrimp. They definitely weren't shy with the seasoning which left something to be desired for the surf of the turf. The steak was cooked to perfection and was extremely tender. The waiter had sold the bleu cheese as a cream base infused with pepper and garlic. Unfortunately it was just a few morsels of blue cheese pressed into the top of the meat. Still, a VERY good cut of steak. nThe meal and a bottle of wine ran me 150 which for the service and ambience I believe is fair. I'll most definitely be going back to give the chef another chance to WOW me.",2
"We travel to Vegas often you can say and pass by the mesmerizing colorful sign all the time. I saw this Groupon deal for 25 towards 50 and it was well worth it that we used on 12 14. We ordered the French dip sandwich with tater tots a lil extra for tots , Signature Burger with White Chocolate bun with fries and the Lollipop Passion Goblet. All was delicious but of course the Lollipop Passion Goblet stole the show. The waitress was awesome and helpful since it was our first time there. I wish i could remember her name. She asked me if I wanted to take pictures of her pouring this special liquid into the goblet even. As soon as she poured it, there was fogging, steaming and bubbling.so FUN! I even took the candy bracelet home to eat it while I gambled LOL! After the bill came, there was still a balance of 40, which was from th Goblet which was 36.yikes! She gave us some white chocolate covered nutty thingy that was soo sooo yummy. Also, Connected to the restaurant they have a very fun candy store! I found the stash of that same white choc covered yummy and bought some to go.oink oink! n nBuffets are always great but it's nice to try other dining options! I would definately recommend this on a girl's night out or even a date.",2
Food was ok. Large portions. Employees there were rude and everyone in line felt very rushed to order Wasn't even busy . Also place didn't seem very clean.,1
"We felt very lucky to happen into this place when looking for breakfast between our campground the beautiful Burro Creek and Phoenix. Bedoian's is delightfully local and unique, and we found it charming. The menu is limited but good, and I was delighted to be able to get an excellent soy latte. I am always looking for places that don't play thumping music, and this one wasn't perfect but it was above average. It seems very much a family restaurant bakery, and the service wasn't just good but helpful above and beyond the call of duty.",2
"I spent 5 pounds to bought a cheesecake and tiramisu, the tiramisu is sooooo sweet taste, and the cheesecake can not take any cheese flavor, the cake it's so hard not soft at all. be honest, these two cakes is the worst cake I had so far. just ate little bit, then I throw it away. ",1
"To begin, all the TSA reps were absolute a holes. There weren't enough scanners open, but that didn't stop them from checking us in like cattle and shoving us in like sardines creating an absolute log jam in front of the conveyor belts. And brain trust that is in charge of moving the plastic tubs from the back to the front fell apart so multiple people were scrambling to other packed lines to grab bins then rushing back to save their place in line before it was taken. And the reps, every single one had serious attitude. Obviously not the best job in the world, but don't take it out on someone else, chief. nThe food options are shit. Enough said. nThe airport in general has a dinginess to it much like walking into Bills or Imperial Palace. Just old and dirty. It's that type of clean feeling you get from staying in a roach coach you know it was technically cleaned, but there's still a grimy feel to the entire place. n nI guess if you come to Vegas you aren't that worried about the airport experience as you might drunk when you get here and hung over when you leave, but if you do either sober, be ready to be let down because this airport is complete crap.",1
"Solid 4 star.due to price and taste! n nThis place is a true hole in the wall.inside the corner of a mini mall on Spring Mtn, in the same parking lot as Pho Saigon 8 and BBQ King! n nStarting off with price and value, this place is awesome. The sandwiches are about 3, and they are filled with plenty of goodies and yummy meats. The sandwiches are fairly large, and one banh mi should fill a normal person up, maybe with a drink and something else on the side.

"This quickly became my boyfriend my favorite spot for pizza delivery! Every time we feel lame for ordering from the same place constantly and try a new spot, we are disappointed and swear all over again to stick to Vinny's pizza! We have also experimented with their Greek salad, Philly cheesesteak, calzones, mozzarella sticks, garlic knots. All of which were so good! I highly recommend you check this place out. Yum! n nAlso, I feel like I have to address the bad reviews. I've never felt discriminated against when I've eaten in and the pizza is sometimes so fresh that it's too hot to eat even when delivered in the middle of this negative degree weather! These people should really give Vinny's another shot!",2

"Whenever there is some sort of holiday or reason to take someone out to a nice steak and seafood dinner this is the place. I wish I could eat there once a week but it's a little pricey for that. In am a huge fan of mastros as well but Dominick's has a really cool ambiance that appeals to me more and it's basically the same menu. n nTheir fresh bread basket has some really tastes breads and I would highly recommend the seafood tower which is my favorite to start or I could just fill up on the seafood tower and a salad alone. n nI also recommend the shrimp Dominick which has this amazing sauce that you can also dip your bread in. n nI have never has a bad cut of meat there and the sides are so delicious and they are pretty large so I am always taking home tons of leftovers. And there is nothing better than steakhouse leftovers except maybe cold pizza but anyway the next day. n nThe butter cake is by far my favorite dessert if you still have room after everything else which is usually not the case for me. n nIf you are looking to impress, this is definitely the spot. Plus the quarter is a cool place to walk around after dinner and iPic is right there to catch a movie at too.",2
"The Brauhaus might just be one of the best pubs in Edinburgh. n nIt's tucked away, and just off the beaten track enough for it to be an absolute treat when you discover it. It's small and its decor is a mixture between a traditional pub and a hip contemporary watering hole. n nIt's fairly small inside, and although the window seating area is comfy with an array of cushions scattered around, it's still hard to get a seat after about 8pm or so. If you've travelled this far to get here however I would argue that it is worth standing for the drink, since they house over 250 beers from around the world! Their menu is categorized by country, and you can hope to try anything from the alluring, brooding darkness of Duvel to beer with a bit of a kick and more percentage! n nIt can get crowded, but it's never in an unpleasant way. It's a very cultured bar with a good atmosphere that I would recommend you visit once during your time in Edinburgh. I have a mission that one day I will try all these beers this bar at least lets me fulfill my life's ambition without having to leave the country!",2
"Despite many of the extremely poor reviews that Marcello's has received on Yelp,my wife and I decided to take a chance and dine there last evening. The short of it I wish we hadn't. n nService was generally good, the waitress was attentive and the restaurant had a suitable ambiance a good combination of family style and traditional Italian. The food, however, was a much different story. My wife and I both ordered pizza I ordered pepperoni and she ordered Canadian bacon with pineapple. Both of our pizzas were the most absolutely tasteless, bland concoctions we have experienced. There was literally NO SAUCE on either of our pizzas, just greasy cheese, a very flat, bland crust and a small amount of toppings. Without sauce, the pizza was just terrible it was dry, somewhat greasy from the cheese and it literally had no flavor whatsoever. This was the most disappointing meal that I have had in quite some time and it came to 40 including tip for 2 pizzas, 2 soft drinks and 2 salads. When I told the waitress about the quality of the food, she simply mentioned that they have a new person preparing the pizzas in the kitchen and that things may be a little off due to the transition. It seems puzzling that someone, despite how new they are, could forget to put sauce on the pizzas. Honestly, I'm not sure sauce alone would have been sufficient to revive Marcello's tasteless pies. n nIf you are hungry for pizza, you will be much better off buying a Tombstone or a Jack's for 4 at Walmart and cooking it yourself. Or better yet, go to Boulders on Broadway or Grimaldi's where you will get excellent food and great service at a comparative bargain price.",1
Took my husband here for his bday sometime in the beginning of November. I told then ahead of time that it was his birthday and the did really special things. It was expensive but he was happy the food was great and free v parking. Not bad at all would do it again. He says this place has the best steak. We even got a picture to take home.,2
"On April 30th I went to Tango for a Gel Manicure and Pedicure. I arrived a few minutes before my 2 00 appointment. The two employees were running behind. Finally Nina went to work on my nails by using cotton drenched with polish remover and wrapped each nail with foil. I was then taken over to the pedicure station where I sat for well over an hour with dripping nails. I noticed that my black shorts were wet but I had no idea that the color was being eaten away. I left the salon at 4 30.2 1 2 hours for a manicure and pedicure. When I got home my shorts did not look right so I washed them. That is when I really noticed the damage as the polish remover really bleached out the color. I went back to Tango this morning May 3rd to show Nina my pants. First she denied that I sat at the pedicure station. Then she said that I should have kept my nails facing down. I had tried that and the foil would fall off. I told her all she had to do was give me a towel for my lap to catch the running polish remover. She then claimed that polish remover would not do that kind of damage and took no responsibility for ruining my favorite shorts. Obviously, they have lost a customer and I told her I would be filing a complaint.",1

"Previously Kan Sushi, Umiya is a new sushi joint out here that's actually close to the strip. n nThis was Chad S's UYE and I couldn't resist the combination of meeting new Yelpers and eating sushi. When it comes to this place, it's all about AYCE. I'm one of those guys that can eat a ton, so AYCE is never a bad choice. As for the food, I got so much of it that it's tough for me to remember, but I'll try. n n Yellowtail and Tuna Nigiri Small, but since it's AYCE it wasn't an issue. Tasty, fresh, and the texture was just right. Believe me, I've had some stale dry nigiri before. My favorite Yellowtail is still at Kaizen off Paradise. n n Katsu Chicken Not bad, just a little greasy. Still fresh and crunchy. Tasted perfect with their chicken fried rice. n n Chicken Fried Rice Thick pieces of chicken mixed with their fried rice. If it's not sushi to come here for, then it's their fried rice. n n Ramen miso Just okay, but it's also one of my first ramens. Not much to compare against. I didn't think it was bad, but others have stated that Chinatown has better. n n Tempura Shrimp Hand Roll I use to be a western roll type of person. Now it's all about Nigiri, Shashimi, and Hand Rolls. Still got a yum yum type hand roll and it didn't disappoint. Again, small but it's ACYE. n n Tempura Ice Cream Not a dessert person, but couldn't resist on this visit. This was pretty good too. n nService wasn't bad considering that our group was fairly big. Between all the food request from other Yelpers, the fact it was Friday night, and because this location was close to the strip.I felt that the service was decent. n nOverall, I will be back. There's a ton of other sushi joints out here in Vegas. But this one is little closer to the strip, which makes it a good stop when out of town friends family are in the sushi mood. n nThanks to Chad S. for setting this up. Got to meet some Yelp friends that I've never met in person. Also was able to hang out with some Yelpers that still are the coolest peeps around. New Yelper Alicia R Terri R's twin was in attendance.

"It's quite appropriate that something in Las Vegas would choose to host a 9 million habitat for lions. Even more appropriate that it's in that one resort with a logo of a gold lion.

After filling the foot tub, I sat there for another 30 minutes before my pedicure! So finally when the lady comes to do my pedicure.she seemed rude. I don't know if she was in a bad mood, but she was not the happiest person, that is probably why my pedicure turned out not so well. I've had better! She was rough with my feet and rude. In fact I had scrapes where she had dug into my skin after the pedicure was done. At the time of the visit also, I asked for a lip and chin wax in which ""I did not receive or they had forgotten that I had asked for "".

I have been going to Ken's for a year now they are usually really great. The last time I was there was a couple weeks ago they had added this new nail bar. It was awful! The chairs are way too tall the workers seem miscible due to the lack of back support I am assuming. It was really disappointing because it is usual so lovely. I would suggest looking for a different place in the area due to recent changes.,1

If you planning to be a regular you gotta keep asking for wifi password and outdoor setting are locked with wires so good luck being comfortable.,1
The service was extra terrible today. I can usually deal with it but today was just bad.,1
"We decided to go here because I read an article where the executive chef of Halcyon a restaurant we really like said he takes his family here. We were thoroughly disappointed. We were not expecting anything fancy, but were hoping for a good, cheap mexican place. To start off, our unhelpful waiter told me that no, they could not make me a margarita without sour mix in it. Okay, fine. We ordered the tableside guacamole, which is almost impossible to mess up unless the avocados aren't ripe, which they were not. The accompanying chips were stale. Next I asked for black beans with my veggie fajitas and was told they didn't have any. The fajitas themselves were greasy and flavorless. My husband ordered enchiladas suiza, and it came topped with a bizarre milky sauce. My son refused to eat his chicken quesadilla because he said the chicken tasted funny. Also, someone else mentioned that they make their own tortillas here. They do not.",1
"This salad bar restaurant is okay. I can't even stress to people enough though that this is on the polar opposite end of Sweet Tomatoes both in quality of food and selection and they are about the same price. The selection here is a lot smaller and you can tell that the quality of produce isn't as high. Also, the bread selection looks like something that they just pulled out of the freezer. I will eat here on occasion with colleagues if we really want a salad bar lunch.",1
"The mojito was fresh and delicious, hubs had the Viejo Rojas and I had the Cuban sandwich both were delicious and the fried plantains were awesome. Service was friendly and quick. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal!",2
"Donatos is my favorite chain pizza in Charlotte or anywhere for that matter . For individual pizza restaurants, Hawthorne's beats them all. Donatos COVER their pizzas with toppings and come up with some unique combinations to entertain diners. Last time, we had the Founder's Favorite which includes pepperoni, sausage, ham, and my favorite hot peppers. YUM! Spice it up, baby! Can't wait to try one of the mariachi ones next time. Ole! For the kids, we got the Hawaiian pizza which was unique in that it also carried almonds and cinnamon in addition to the regular ham and pineapple. Hmm. Interesting. And inventive. n nThey may be a little more expensive than the normal chains like Papa John's, Pizza Hut, or Domino's, but they are SO worth it. And with more locations popping up around Charlotte, you're bound to find one in your area that delivers or you can swing by on the way home for pick up.",2
"We started the night a lot here in college. I never order long islands anywhere else, but that's the only thing I've ever ordered here. They are HUGE, delicious, and 3 until 11pm. That is a DEAL. After one or two of these you really don't need any other drinks for the rest of the night, they are crazy strong. Really fun on game days. You will most likely run into people who lived in your dorm freshman year here.no matter how many years later it is.",2
"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. After having a decent 20 massage, when it came time to pay I didn't have any cash to tip the massage lady. I asked to leave a 5 dollar tip on my card. The owner and massage literally badgered me to leave a 10 dollar tip. I work for tips on the strip and if I ever asked for a tip I would be fired immediately. So unprofessional and rude! I will never ever recommend or come here again. They need to work on there customer service skills",1
"Was out with my friends for a night of fun, but we needed to stop and get something to eat just chat, so we wound up at Blue 32, never been here and what a nice little find. Great sports bar with lots of big TV's , do you know how many sports bars I have been in that had tiny TV's that the only people who can watch it was the ones at the bar, left me thinking what's the point. But here in Blue 32 didn't matter where you sat, you could see the TV well! Oh yea! n nOur server was Katie and she was good at making sure our drinks were filled and that we were happy! Thanks Katie! n nI ordered the pastrami sliders came with pickle and had mustard on the bun with an order of fries. I am a pastrami lovin fool and these were good little sliders, but were light on the mustard, but asked Katie for a side and she brought me out a bottle! Nicely done! n nLook forward to coming back and trying out different things!",2
"This isn't going to be a positive post. Partying in Vegas makes me hungry, so one morning I decided I wanted to eat pancit palabok to settle this stomach. That day it wasn't so bad. I ate it and left. n nAfter telling my parents I ate at Goldilocks in Vegas, they push on eating there all the time. The service is horrible, and my chicken arroscaldo had bits and pieces of of bone in it, not cool. My siapo was 3.49, overpriced. n nNothing here is positive that is worth mentioning about. It's even hard to find.",1
A group of 8 of my friends ordered various items off the menu and not a single one had anything good to say about the food. The hot dogs are plain Jane and the toppings are poor quality. I would recommend eating elsewhere.,1
"I don't know how I have this place two stars 2 years ago when they clearly should have been a 1 star the whole time. n nA lot of you reading my reviews like to harass me for being ""harsh "" or whatever the F u want to call it. I'm my Personal opinion I call it being honest and blunt. Which I am at all times you can bet your a anytime any day I will tell you how it is whether you like it or not. Now let me just say I hate this specific movie theater and only come here because it's closer than others but I'm refusing at this point to come here to watch any movie we have been waiting to see for some time since my boyfriend and I don't normally make it out as much as we used too. n nWhy do I hate this movie theater again? n n TEENAGERS nI do not miss that stage in my life what so ever. Annoying as hell and only have gotten worse especially out here in Arizona. I'm sorry but moving out here 5 years ago has brought me to realize how ignorant racist stupid overly prideful arizonians are out here and it's really sickening. I would never raise my children in this state because of the type if people I've seen at this movie theater and it sums it up each and every time mostly during the summer. Kids constantly kick your chair out here thinking I can be a rude twat waffle and kick this lady's chair and she can't do anything about it because my parents have all the money in the world and I can get away with murder. n nThat's the type of kids I see at this mall and theater every single time. It's awesome. NOT. I'm totally rolling my eyes probably every other paragraph thinking of all the times I've been here n nAt least in Northern California you have parents and people who have respect for people and the decency to stop their misbehaved children from ever acting like the idiots we have out here. Just sayin. n nLike I said this theater blows and will always suck because of all the little teens running around wild in this place. And too many to where if you did complain would be hundreds more waiting to kick the hell out of your chair, yell in your ears, laugh way too much so you can't hear a damn thing or spill food and drinks all over you and not apologize for it either. How do you like to watch your movies? Maybe not in complete and utter piece but I can tell you I would rather listen to my dog cry like he always does in movies in my ear over all the above listed things at this movie theater. That's for damn sure! n n awaits hate mail for being honest n nX x",1
"Courthouse Bar Grill is a decent place to get a sandwich at lunch 3 stars with an extra star added in for good customer service and relaxed atmosphere. n nAround lunchtime, you'll find this place packed. It seems to be the center of the Las Vegas legal universe around noon. The menu is fairly standard for a lunch place burgers, sandwiches, salads, wraps . The food is decent, but not remarkable. Burgers are made with frozen patties, but the fries are tasty. The wraps are fresh and worth a try. There's a few fried options try the chicken fingers which are delicious, but most chicken fingers are . Bottom line Courthouse Bar Grill is a decent place to get a meal if you're downtown and don't want to drive somewhere. If you order a sandwich, know that it'll be good enough. n nAs the workday ends, this place is a nice, relaxed space to grab a few beers. It's a good, quiet place to ramp down after work. n nBottom line the food isn't worth writing home about, but the atmosphere's laid back and the staff is super friendly. 4 stars overall.",2
You cannot go wrong at Bungalow! Bungalow was my very first Old Town celebration location when I got my job last summer! My friends and I also come here all the time during Spring Training season. During the summer the patio is a no go since it is way too hot outside but it is pleasant inside. They have a good variety of beer choices as well as an open bar. Their grilled cheese and fries app is where it's at! I usually get the half 1 full gc sandwich vs. the full 2 gc sandwiches . I usually add bacon to mine as well since you cannot go wrong with bacon. I love Bungalow!,2
"Two maids and a thief! n nWe moved into a new house this summer and by fall wanted to get someone to clean the house after we had settled in. n nCalled this service and made an appointment they ask you to prioritize what you need done in the house and they send two women over for two hours. We tried to stay out of their way to they could work, so we really weren't watching what they were doing every minute, of course. n nWhat was apparent, almost from the beginning,was the woman who took the upstairs was doing a fantastic and thorough job. The woman working downstairs seemed a bit slower and unsure of herself. n nWhat was more apparent when they left was that the woman who had worked downstairs had barely done anything large sections of the floor and furniture had not been swept nor dusted. What she had been busy doing was figuring out a way to steal one of our electronic devices we had left sitting out and charging on a table nearby. We noticed it was missing later that day, and it was so obvious who had taken it that there was no doubt in our minds. n nWe called Two Maids to see what they could do about it very little, apparently. They questioned the woman, just to see if she had ""moved "" it. She had moved it, all right into her possession. We waited a couple of days to see if it would magically ""turn up, "" but it did not. We filed a police report. n nA couple weeks passed before the Char Meck police showed up at our door. They had recovered our device from a pawn shop. It seems they're supposed to report stolen property, so we're glad we filed the police report. The officer who brought it in asked us a few questions they seemed to have strong suspicions already about who had dropped it off at the pawn shop. n nAfter recharging our recovered device and turning it back on, expecting that it had been damaged somehow, I was surprised and pleased to note the thief had configured their email and left a copy of their resume, including name, address and phone number. The identity of the this person coincided with, you guessed it, the name of the woman who cleaned our downstairs the same woman they arrested at work a couple days later. n nIt's bad enough that she stole something from our house when we weren't looking, but what's worse is the way Two Maids insisted ""we background check "" everyone. It's not good enough this woman was sketchy from the start, not to mention a LOUSY housekeeper, no matter how you look at it. Her job performance was beyond poor and I doubt she had any training at all. n nWe're lucky that she was dumb enough to leave her resume right on the thing, as well as the photos she and her children had taken of each other with it made it much easier for the cops to nail her. And that she was dumb enough to turn it into a pawn shop instead of selling it outright. n nAnd I can almost forgive Two Maids for sending a thief into my house, but I could not forgive them for sending me a ""professional cleaner "" who was anything but that.",1
"Courtyard Marriott is fantastic choice in terms of location convenience n nTraveling for work brings me to Charlotte this Marriott is literally right across the street from my office n nComfy bed w good pillows score! nQuiet! Couldn't hear neighbors nBathroom was big shower rocked! nFREE Wifi! n nLOTS of restaurants close by to take care of any all cravings n nNo fridge. n nAnd through no fault of their own, it doesn't directly connect to the overground tunnels that connect all the other buildings in Uptown n. you gotta go all the way downstairs then over to the Parking Garage to gain access n nBut with the office right across the street, I guess I can make the sacrifice walk outdoors. Lots of love for Courtyard!",2
"Some of the best Chinese food I have had in Phoenix. Very fresh colorful presentation, great tea, great service, nice atmosphere. The menu is extensive with plenty of meals under 10. n nWe arrived around 7pm and were promptly seated. I tried the Kung Pao Chicken which was very good could have been a little hotter and ""my partner in crime "" chose the orange chicken she raved about it. n nThe egg drop soup was excellent, the crab puffs sublime, and the fortune cookies crap aren't they always .",2
"If your looking for a great small venue show at a reasonable price on the strip then this is it. A ""variety "" of acts, some better than others, but all good some even great. Very funny at times. The venue is very small so there isn't a bad seat in the house. I saw one of the featured acts in a Cirque show only this time I was right in front of it. Afterwards all the performers were at the exit to take photos and autograph. Great for families! I can't recommend this show enough.",2
"My first night out without the baby 8 months later and celebrating the end of my 20s, Yonaka was my pick for the night. Was I satisfied.yep. Will I return.yep eventually. There's too many new places for me to try since I've been MIA from the dinner world. n nWe decided against the omakase. We've done the whole omakase thing before and just didn't leave full. So we got to order what we wanted and that's how I like it! My favorite dishes ishiyaki beef ""Kobe "" beef cooked on a stone.so delish with side salts sauce for flavor but I didn't need it , the sake oranji salmon with some oils and tobiko pretty good , baby take and the avocado sushi. n nWe had ordered 12 items and had a chefs special the Kudamono given to us for free. The sauce on the Kudamono, jalape u00f1o based sauce with little crispies was such an awesome delight! Everything else we ordered like the Hotate Kokoro was just over seasoned. It took away from the scallops in the Hotate Kokoro as it was just too salty. The toro wasn't melt in your mouth fatty goodness and the salmon belly was too fishy for my liking as it had the typical Chinese steamed fish sauce on it. Don't get me wrong I still think this place was a winner but I just scraped off the salt seasonings and went on to the next item. n nService was attentive, but there were only a few diners on a Monday night. Although it took awhile to get the check a good 15 minutes and since I'm a tired new mom I was a bit cranky after that as it was wayyyy past my bedtime. We ordered 12 dishes plus one from the chef and I also got a free sorbet for it being my birthday. The total with tip came out to be under 200 bucks which in our case was totally worth it because we were stuffed and got to pick what we really wanted to eat. Yonaka was delish and I hope they continue to do well.",2
"I haven't been inside this location in years, but I don't remember it being this big. TWSS. Maybe it's because I have been cheating on this PC with its South Blvd counterpart. n nThe workers here are so nice. While in line, our cashier answered a lady's 400 questions about balloons. It was a lot to handle. The worker did it with a huge smile on his face. Someone hand that guy a blue ribbon. n nClean store. Convenient location. Can't find what you're looking for? Sounds impossible, but just in case there's a WalMart next door. n nThrowing a party and need some inspiration? Come wander the aisles here for an hour or so to get the creative juices flowing.",2
"I had already heard good things about this place and was excited to try it. When I walked into the place it had an old school tone which I liked. The lady at the counter helped me right away so there was no waiting which was good. Not only that, but every time I walked near the register a new person would ask if I needed help. That's a great staff right there. I ordered for take out so I still had to drive home before trying it and it made me crazy. The food smelled so good. The crust was perfectly golden and crisp and it had the perfect amount of toppings. This is by far the best pizza place I have come across since moving out here. I'll be coming back soon.",2
"Chino Bandido has the best food you never thought you'd ever enjoy. n nI ordered the combo plate since I wanted to try a wider variety of what they had. I got their ginger chicken, the jade chicken, the pork fried rice, and the black beans and jerk fried chicken wrapped into a burrito. n nGinger chicken awesome nJade chicken awesome nPork fried rice great but not something you eat just by itself, you've got to mix it up with everything else nBlack beans omg these are great. I'm not sure why but they tasted like pizza tomato sauce but hey, pizza tomato sauce tastes good too. n nI'll be back again, it was pretty good and while I was sitting at the picnic tables the plastic folding tables rock I read up on the history of Chino Bandido online and it's just an all around great story of a super successful family owned establishment that came up with a unique menu and hit a home run. n nIf you're up for something new and something you won't find elsewhere, swing by and grub. I'm bringing some friends from London and Hong Kong to eat here later this week. I'm sure they'll love it.",2
"The Baristas here always gets it right! Eventhough the location is weird and no drive thru, we love coming here cause the drinks are made correctly! Drinks taste perfect! We love this location and the Barristas are quick!",2
"Bf has had a love for IHOP's plain, fluffy pancakes for the longest time. When he finally convinced me that he wasn't joking about this, I conceded to come here for breakfast. n nThis location was a little over a mile away from our hotel, so we were here in a flash and walked in just before noon for some breakfast. n nParking in the huge lot that they share with Firestone was a snap, and we were immediately seated at a booth in their air conditioned environment. n nThe menu was bigger than I expected with tempting pictures. It's been decades since I've even uttered the word IHOP in a serious way, so my tummy sat up and took notice. n nI passed up the T Bone Steak Eggs and the Sirloin Tips Eggs and eyed the omelettes. The regular omelettes' egg batter has pancake mix in it, to ""make them more fluffy "", so I chose to get the healthy and fit omelette not served with pancakes like the regular omelettes, but served with fruit instead . It's made with egg substitute n nSpinach, Mushroom and Onion Omelette, add steak, no salt served with a mix of cantaloupe, honeydew and grapes, this omelette had fresh leaf spinach, big mushroom slices, and diced onions and tomatoes. It was fresh, tasty, and the added steak was pretty good. n nBf had the Sampler bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns and his beloved pancakes, which were indeed fluffy and yummy. n nBf's OJ wasn't fresh squeezed, but the service was very attenttive and the food was so frrsh that I won't fault them too much for the juice. n nI guess I can support bf's love for the fluffy going forward!",2
"We have been here before and it was just OK. Bought a Groupon and tried it again. Mediocre at best. Great looking place, awesome patio but it all ends there. There is no passion here. Service is not attentive and the food is just not very good. Onion rings were good. This place needs to take a look around and see why their neighbors are always busy and they are not. It became evident to us tonight.",1
Loved the Kalua Pig! Really fairly priced and Chris is super passionate about his recipes! I've got nothing but love for this place! DON'T FORGET TO EAT THE COCONUT BARK! IT'S AMAZING! I'll be visiting often!,2
"Yak, yak, yak. nI believe they are trying to revive the Fremont street, but it is just not working. Waisted an hour, walked from beginning to the end and ran back to the car. Don't bother! Stick to the strip, to the new hotels, and you will do just fine ",1
"Positively Sinful! This is NOT diet food! Meaning it is the yummiest, messiest all around best burger I have ever consumed. They do have healthier options for those that want to eat lite, but why hold back?",2
"I'm a fan since they have these in Cali. This location is nicely located and good store layout. Pleasant as they had live music playing and wine tasting dont know if they do that all the time I was there during a weekend.maybe special event? . n nWine selection of course is King and second is liquor and last is beer. A few I havent seen at Lees, but most craft and imports are the same. Am not surprised as distribution of beers is a political racket and it's hard to get good beers to the shelf. Still, not bad. Nice selection of single and big bottles. I like that they organize and label choices with basic flavor and style descriptions and 100 scale ratings on beers, not just a plain pricetag. n nAlso unlike Lee's where I run into mostly frat boys grabbing cases of Natty Ice and some Keystones , we ran into a ""beer advocate "" here who chimed in that the La Fin Du Monde was the best Unibroue beer since I was having trouble on my selection and just talked beers and aging and about Aces Ales bar. It was awesome to meet someone in the normally lonely craft brew aisle. I'm not a beer snob by all means, drink what you like just don't make claims like Bud Light is ""real beer "" to me and superior cuz you'll look like an ass , but it is a lonely but very tasty hobby. Seems like this location and environment invites some beer drinkers. n nOne plus is that it seemed on select items, I noticed it was cheaper than Lee's. Every little bit of savings is always great specially when I'm buying a 14 four pack on a regular basis its about 12 here . n nI find the checkout aisles funny with each having a lit number and take out your IDs and we prosecute minors on every lit sign. Good that they ID but man they made me feel awkward. She looked at my ID and gave it back after writing my birthdate on a paper and I place it back in my purse. Then goes ""you are 21 right? "" I just gave her a strange look, ""you want my ID again? "" So I hand her my ID again and she showed it to her manager to look over. Eerrr, okay. Dont know what that was about. n nDefinitely going to keep on coming as this is better store in Vegas, but out of all the Total Wine More stores, I LOVE the Rancho Cucamonga location and the staff there rocks.",2
"I'm a local, so I decided to finally try Studio B after hearing all the good reviews. What a mistake! We visited three different times, each on different days and each for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was not at all impressed with the food or the atmosphere set up of the buffet. There may be a lot of selection, but the quality is just not there. I'd take quality over quantity anytime! We finally decided that even though they send us coupons for free buffets each month, there is no way we will ever be going back. Nor will we recommend to anyone to spend the money for sub par food. There are far better quality buffets for a much more reasonable price.",1
"Way too damn overpriced. Period. Every tall beverage was at least 4. In Seattle it's a buck or so less. 3.25 for a muffin. 4 for a coffee energy drink in the 15 oz. can . I spent 13 for a canned coffee drink, muffin, and cup of fruit.",1
"Oh my this is such a great little hidden gem of a place! We came here today to enjoy their happy hour, we are always looking for good little happy hour spots to renew ourselves after not so joyous days, Woo hoo! Boy it WAS definitely Feliz Happy hour for us! n The mojitos were oh so Delicious and just 7 each. While the Cali and spicy tuna rolls were just 3.95 each! Talk about YAY and WOW! But wait there is more, they also offer scrumptious shrimp tempura rolls for just 5.95, What a steal right? n WHY ask for more! Well, okay we did too, so we had the Pad Thai, which was great with a load of yummy flavorful noodles and chicken along with a small portion of veggies, we also ordered their Chicken Yellow Curry, that was rich and creamy and ever so satisfying! n This place is soooo AWESOME that they even have a scale of hotness for their plates 1 5, 5 being the hottest, PLUS for those whom prefer their food super hot and spicy they also have the Thai 7, which is their absolute hottest. I myself settled for a 4, and that surprisingly was hot enough, yet edible and just right for me! Even after consuming all of our food that we knew and felt was colossal, we experienced a HAPPY FULL and not a GREASY FATTY FULL. Finally, we had a great time and the service was FANTASTIC as well as the food! We truly enjoyed ourselves here, the vibe was just right and the people there were ever so nice. You deserve a High five! n n Narai, you will be seeing our hungry faces more often! n Thank you new friends! ",2
"It's an okay start, but in this area this restaurant may fail due to pricing. n nI stopped in for lunch with a coworker. The staff were warm and greeting and hyped the quality of their food prior to ordering. n nI got a BLT plus Avocado and my friend a chicken Caesar salad. With one fountain drink added in the bill was just shy of 30 before tip. That is decent, a bit pricey, but now consider that this was a weekday lunch, that means I'll be going elsewhere. n nThe food wasn't bad, but it didn't best other lunch options for sitdown restaurants, especially for what we paid. n nOn a note, there is no way my coworkers salad was worth 13.99! n nMy suggestion would to add a lunch menu with paired down portions at a reasonable price and value. Maybe try a 6.99 or 7.99 lunch special otherwise I don't see business picking up anytime soon. n nIt's really a shame, but I hope to update the review on this place later once some kinks in their menu are worked out.",1
"Great cafe in downtown Las Vegas. Loved everything I had on my first visit already planning on when I can return. I had the green juice, the Chile omelette, tried the fried apple rings. So good! And love that the food is all fresh, much of it direct from the farmers market downtown.",2
We take our dog Dakota there every weekend and sometimes during the week. The best time to go is early morning when other dogs are there to play! You will see the same people and dogs routinely which is also a plus. Very clean too! Highly recommend for those who live close by!,2
"My husband and I came here in late August and the weather was threatening a monsoon right as we arrived, so the restaurant interior was jam packed, I convinced the hostess that we really were okay with the risk of getting wet and she let us sit on the empty patio, which was blessedly deserted. Our bet paid off as it didn't storm on us and instead we got to enjoy the light show and blowing trees overhead as we noshed on a mixed bruschetta board and a pub board. n nI'm a big fan of their bruschetta combinations, they really have a beautiful way of combining sweet and savory ingredients in a way you wouldn't expect, but surprise your taste buds nevertheless. I enjoyed a peach Bellini while my husband, who doesn't drink, had a really delightful cucumber honey lemonade. As unusual sounding as it is, it's really quite amazing. n nThis is such a nice place for an evening out, sans children. If you haven't been yet you really MUST check it out go now!",2
"Trump is my new favorite hotel destination in Vegas. I had a fantastic stay even though it was only for an evening. Everything about this place screams elegance from the moment I stepped into the lobby to when I first opened the door to my room. n nIt was so nice to step into a hotel and not having to inhale the cigarette smoke filled air of a casino. The room was suite style with plenty of lounge chairs, a couch, and a coffee table. There was a pseudo kitchen with an electric stove top, microwave, mini fridge, and even a toaster. The king size bed was super comfortable from the pillows to the mattress and linens. Free complimentary coffee and two bottles of water. Double sinks in the bathroom. There was even a freakin' jacuzzi in the bathroom! Don't forget the super soft bathrobes. Last, but not least, a TV built into the mirror in the bathroom. n nThe one knock on this place was that the TV in the bedroom was broken, but after notifying the front desk at check out, they waived my resort fee. I wish I had extended my stay here longer!",2
"Simply put, if you can't afford to eat at nice buffet and wish to enjoy crab, this is the place. Othewise skip this place since the crab tasted like mash potatos and all though they don't run out of food, the customers grab all they can get as soon as they bring the crab or lobster out. nFood tasted like 2nd or 3rd day left overs and hate to say it. I tend to give great reviews to places that I enjoy and this is not one of them. nMy friend that took me there keep telling me that the food is great for the price and I was thinking well I guess if you are hungry enough, you can eat out of garbage cans and the cost would be great also. nI would not return to this place to eat because I rather eat white rice by itself then the food they serve. n nSorry for the bad review, I'm sure there are tons of people that enjoy the value but once you know what food supposed to taste like, it's hard to go back to this type of buffet.",1
a locals eatery of well prepared traditional japanese. amazing staff and well rounded menu. escape the whorish bustle of the strip and have a nice PG rated meal tonight.,2
"JC Penny Coupons galore, but not anymore. So I have been coming to this JC Penny for a very long time and they just recently renovated. The results? SPECTACULAR! It is an absolutely gorgeous store and was made even better by the renovations. They sort of became a department store with ""high end "" showcasing. Their new JC Penny line and Jeans bar are just a few of the additions. It isn't always the most organized store and the employees can be pretty unwilling to help but at the very least you have a gorgeous store to rummage around in. n nIts not to say that all the employees are unwilling but some with sort of point in a direction to have you search for something rather than just show you. Located inside a mall. and great new additions. Aside from the staff a place upon thee, Four Stars!",2
"After seeing so many people go to this place and mention how good it is, decided to go try it out with my family. n nKorean owned japanese restaurant, located in an EH area of town. Not the nicest area lol. n nDecor, gotta give it to them. Overall i think it looks pretty nice. Lots of wooden fencing accents and along the walls. n nAYCE All you can eat sushi is 20.95 for lunch 1130A 300P and 25.95 for dinner 300P 200A . Also mentions about having an ""ordering time limited to 45 minutes for lunch, and 1 hour for dinner. dining time is not limited "". This doesn't really make sense to me but its never really enforced anyway. n nAs always, order a sample of nigiri to test, and order more if good ! so this is what i ordered XD not at the same time, over course of dinner n nA mention of the rice. I'm not the pickiest but im not the kind of person that will say everything and anything is good. I do have a favorite place in terms for rice used in sushi. Rice is a compliment to the fish that it is paired with. Both have to be good in quality for a good experience. One can not be good without the other. n nThis rice. Not much flavored. Breaks apart. Mushy. If i had to rate just the rice? 1 out of 5. n nTuna Maguro dark red. mushy. little to no flavor. doesn't seem really fresh either. cant sense any metallic taste to the fish either n nYellowtail Hamachi nice pinkish color. sweet. n nRed Snapper Izumidai nice color. good texture. n nHalibut Hirame not really fresh. no ""bite "" n nSalmon sake probably one of the better items of the nigiri list. tastes fatty and fresh. too bad rice was bad. otherwise would have been good. n nSmoked Salmon the most awkward one ordered by cousin . not like any of the usual smoked salmon i've had before. Thick slice. slightly lighter and firmer than a normal salmon piece. you can smell the smoked aroma fairly quickly. taste was a bit salty but expected for a smoked salmon. n nFresh Water Eel Unagi not bad. the eel was a little cold. not sure if it's because of sitting on table or what. eel texture was mid mushy mid firm. sauce was normal. sweet. n nSalmon Egg Ikura ""fishy popping boba "" as what my cousin called it. had its usual salty flavor but may not be fresh either. had a ""fishy "" taste. n nEgg Tamago surprisingly, this was nicely made. Thick cut piece. presentation was a bit non traditional. imagine the size of a fish nigiri cut. folded in half. and cut mid way to make a pyramid over a small ball of rice. not only did it not hold the rice, it was a bit weird presentation wise . taste wise, it was good. nice and sweet. n nSweet Shrimp Amaebi Not really sweet. Small shrimp as well. Not exactly sure if its even real amaebi. A tip had mentioned it is not real amaebi. more like regular shrimp marinated in a sweet sauce. n nBeef Tataki worst one of all. Not saying the way it is done is bad. but the quality of the beef was bad. almost all the beef had a fairly big chewy piece that made it seem like you just ate a piece of beef chewing gum. beef wasnt seasoned either. so quite plain in taste overall. n nKake Udon small bowl of udon in a kake light broth made with laver, bonito flakes, soy sauce . udon was cooked pretty good. still a good ""bite "". not overcooked. Good way to stuff yourself cuz there wasnt much other items that caught my attention n nAppetizers ! n nBaked Green Mussel not sure what sauce they used. some sweet sauce mixed with the japanese mayo. mussel was warm at best. mussel was in whole pieces. not cut in half. n nShrimp Tempura also one of the better items of the meal. nicely breaded and fried. nice light golden color. crispy and hot. n nGolden Scallop deep fried to a light brown color. overcooked for my preference in terms of scallop. even the center was fully cooked. at least its a real scallop. n nGrilled Mackerel Rec' by Michael K overgrilled. meat was a bit dry. as expected from mackerel, lots of small bones. not skilled to eat it fast XD n nSalmon Skin Handroll w Fresh Salmon Rec' by Michael K also one of the better items of the meal. Fairly stuffed hand roll with crispy fried salmon skin, but also cuts of fresh salmon pieces as well. Good recommendation ! n nSpider soft shell crab, crab, avocado, cucumber, gobo w eel sauce Soft shell crab was a bit cold. Not sure if the crab was fried before hand or what not. Didn't notice the gobo in the roll. n nBurning Your Ass spicy soft shell crab, tuna, cucumber, crab, spicy tuna, spicy kiss sauce, mustard sauce, jalapeno, sriracha on top to be honest, i did NOT notice there was soft shell crab in this. yeah there was sriracha and jalepeno on it. and spicy tuna, but eh. its no where near burning MY ass XD n nOverall experience, eh. Service was good. Tea is 1. Food was not up to what people have said. Most likely won't come back again.",1
"Veal pasta kept sticking to roof of my mouth hard to chew. Catered to larger group near us, we asked for check multiple times and they were kind but we didn't receive it for at least 10 mins after. Seem gracious but lack in the attentive dept.",1
"Bagels Forever is a great little Madison secret for those on a budget. Bagels are 45 cents each and are made fresh in the BF headquarters behind the bagel shop, as evidenced by the smell of blueberry, cinnamon, and everything bagel that wafts over University Avenue on certain days. I always gravitate towards the sesame and w hole wheat bagels, but I love the cinnamon raisin too. Other notable flavors include maple cinnamon, cranberry oat, salt, egg, and pumpernickel. My colleague tells me that their bagels are some of the closest you'll get to New York bagels, as they're boiled. If I ever visit NYC someday, I'll know what bagels to compare them to. However, I wouldn't recommend the lox here the one time I had it, I found it mushy and flavorless. n nWhat I really, truly love about this place are the cheap sandwiches. Cheaper than Einstein's or Panera, and better than a fast food joint. 2.35 will buy you a hot, toasted breakfast sandwich with a protein bacon, sausage, Canadian bacon, you name it , egg, and cheese on a delicious bagel, wrapped in foil. Their lunch sandwiches are in the 2 3 range, made with Boar's Head meats and cheeses and come with a dill pickle spear. n nTo go with your food, Bagels Forever sells cans of Dr. Brown's! soda, chips, their own cream cheese, milk, butter, half and half, etc, so they're handy if you live nearby. I also get their sliced deli meat to go. What's great about this place is that they seem to sell their food at wholesale prices. It's kind of a throwback to buy a Coke for 52 cents plus tax. n nDecor looks like it hasn't changed since the place opened, there are no tables, and the lines can get long at breakfast time, but don't let that stop you. If you're on the way to campus, stop in and try this place out.",2
"So my boyfriend ordered the salmon and really liked it, I ordered the fried shrimp po boy and HATED it. Omg it was nasty, everything that was on my plate was no good. I'm very picky so i tried going with something that I was familiar with. The fried shrimp were barely fried, shouldn't have even called them that and they were VERY rubbery. On top of that they were massive. I mean the shrimp were huge. So just imagine taking a bite into a sandwich and eating a half fried giant rubber shrimp. I couldn't even eat it. I moved on to the chips hoping i could eat something on the plate, but no. They were chewy?! Why? Maybe that's how they were suppose to be and I'm just so out of tune with what's going on. But I didn't eat those either. My boyfriend did however because the small portion of salmon on his plate left him still hungry. You think for 18 you'd be able to get full. Anyways I'm not going back just off that one experience. I think I'll pass. Out was that bad. For the price expensive I should have loved everything. Oh yea we also had the cheese curds, once again disappointed. Greasy and no flavor. I love cheese curds and being from Wisconsin I know a good one when I eat it and they definitely weren't up to par. I'll pass",1
"New Management? n nI'm not sure what is going on with this place, but it used to be awesome. nI went there the other day and it was totally different in bad way. nI ordered my usual General Tao Chicken for Carry Out nI couldn't understand the person on the phone but I thought I heard 30mins! nI was right, i showed up in 15, and waited another 20 mins for a single order. nI thought it would be worth the wait but it wasn't. n nThey couldn't provide a receipt either, and took an extra 5 mins figuring that out to then tell me, sorry we can't provide a receipt. n nWhen I got home I was even more disappointed to find no egg roll, which is supposed to come with the combo meal, according to every Chinese menu nInstead it came with a tiny soggy Crab Rangoon that tasted horrible. nEven worse was the meal that was half the portion size it used to be and all the nasty ends of chicken that were burnt. n n I've had better at happy wok through the drive through. n nNever going here again and I suggest you do the same!",1
"I went to this little farmer's market to avoid the hordes that have converged on the Capitol and State Street for Maxwell Street Days. This is WAY more my speed. I don't have to trip over fifty people and get assaulted by a stroller to get that lovely bunch of Thai basil I was looking for. I also scored French green beans, red onions, and some gorgeous zucchini and summer squash. Can't wait for dinner!",2
"Conclusion n Bypass everything else and go here. Don't waste your time, it's a no brainer. If it was a little closer to work I would come here every other day at least I wouldn't say that about any other place n nRundown n Neighborhood is sketchy no offense n DRIVE THRU! n Phenomenal Food n A little pricey for random mexican place but worth every penny n Phenomenal Food n Not near the strip n Not for the tourista n Cost Benefit skewed far towards benefit n nDetail Context n Moved to Vegas recently and showed up here with my buddy at the insistence of a local we came by the day before but it was closed around 10PM We walked in and ordered instantly lucky? n n 2xCarne asada burritos and a carne quesadilla, OMG the flavor was perfect, the ingredients were fresh and the meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We were sad we couldn't eat more. n n I can't wait to go back",2
Excellent service and meal. Had the special Veal Chop on the bone with King Crab and Bernaise sauce. The stone crabs were okay. Not worth the 50 lb. Maybe 40 lb is right.,2
"Fast service, good service great food. 95 of items under 10. I had the Norte u00f1a torta with steak papaya cremosa both were bomb. I think I'll try the Del Rey next time the mango cremosa. My girlfriend had like a chicken torta that was very good as well. She got a strawberry banana cremosa which I did like better than my papaya one. All in all I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix.",2
"Had to drop this down to one star. I'm pretty tired of going in and finding NOTHING of what I need. Happened again. They barely stock six packs so you're forced to buy 12 packs. It gets on my nerves so badly I can't even explain it. n nThe store always looks dark and dingy and filthy. I feel dirty when I go in. The aisles are small, they carry a really small selection. I'm never shopping here again, not when there's a Total Wine a few miles away from me. n nThis place sucks.",1
"Pretty good sub. Regular size is a decent size sandwhich. Good enough for lunch. n nI ordered the Club Supreme. Turkey and roast beef with bacon. The bacon was crispy and that's a plus. Ordered it Mikes Way without tomato or onion. So it had lettuce, mayo, oil and vinegar, seasoning, and salt. I added pickle and banana peppers. n nThey put on a lot of oil and vinegar so beware if you aren't the biggest fan. They slice the meat and cheese when you order so that's nice. n nOverall it was a good sandwhich. Will probably come back.",2
"We came here because of Tom Colicchio, we expect that the food would be really good. Indeed! The food was just absolutely delicious. I had a fillet mignon, very very tender. And my husband had a rib eye that had a nice grill flavor, also very tender. We had assorted mushrooms and asparagus for our sides, they compliment very well with the steak. Service was not as good as I expect, but it is certainly a very nice steakhouse.",2
"The staff were friendly, nice and efficient. Place is clean, easy to find. I got a pedicure and gel manicure in one hour. I did not have to wait long since there were maybe only 3 other women in the salon at that time. I would certainly come back here if i need a quick mani pedi.",2
Great place for both individual and group workouts.,2
"I've always had a great experience at this location, but I've heard so many rumors about problems when ordering chicken. Considering this is an Italian restaurant, it is recommended to get the pasta. nLOVE bottomless salad and garlic bread. Garlic bread sooo good. nI love the caeser salad here too! nPrice range is good, food is good, experience is good, I would recommend to pasta lovers.",2
This store is great all the shipping supplies you would ever need. Super cute boxes to mail presents and cute cards. Very friendly and helpful staff. Convenient location and hours. I would recommend for any shipping needs.,2
"It was a wonderful experience! Starting with their wonderful water infused with lime, oranges, and cucumber. So refreshing. We started out with their Pork Confit amazing and P u00e2t u00e9 eh, have had better . Second course we ordered the beet salad, I must say I'm still dreaming about their perfectly cooked beets and the truffled cherve goat cheese . It was the best beet salad I've ever had. The pizzas we ordered were the Brassacre the Brussel sprouts and bacon were great , the Goomba my fav of the 3, superb job on this pizza amazingness , and the Barberini would have been my favorite, but the chilis didn't fit with the ricotta and honey, I will order it without next time . My waitress was, eh, ok I guess. She seemed eager to send us on our way, and was a bit messy. The over all ambience was super quaint and romantic, love the candlelight! Great place for a date night. I loved it! The missing star was for the waitress and the unnecessary too hot chilis. Keep up the good work other wise grampas!",2
"Food is awesome. Burgers are amazing. HOWEVER, sadly, one waitress completely ruined my experience there. Nichole was our waitress.was ok til the end. My account was in the negative for 4 days because of a mistake that she made, the bank charged me an overdraft fee the restaurant's manager, Michael, has not followed through with anything he said he would. Nice guy, but ""niceness "" does not equal good customer service.",1
"I like this place.cute and neighborly. The food was also tasty and the owners employees were very friendly and helpful. The problem was that the owner proprietor manager couldn't make a chai latte to save her life. They were on the menu, so it's not like I made a special order . It took her a good 20 30 minutes of me standing there for her to track down the ingredients in the cupboards, then concoct the thing. She was very apologetic, but it was still a bit inconvenient and odd considering it was a coffee shop. n nNevertheless, I'm certainly willing give it a second chance, especially since I haven't tried the food yet.",1
"Wow, this place misses, by a loooooong shot. n nFood wise, this place should be rated zero stars, but the server was SO nice and did such a great job, I had to bump it up. If I could rate service alone, I would give this place four stars. n nHere's the breakdown. n nI've been here probably over a dozen times over ten years, and it's pretty much always the same. Ambiance is ok, clean but dated. As others have mentioned, the only thing to order here is fajitas, and I did, preceded by a cheese crisp appetizer, which I read was great on Yelp. n nIn short, the simplest stuff at Fajitas is the problem. Their 'salsa' is literally tomato paste and maybe some powdered garlic? It is truly bland and tasteless, remarkably so. It's almost like jr. high cafeteria lady dropouts are making the salsa, it is just a train wreck. I asked our server if they had a hotter read flavorful salsa, and he brought over some hot sauce. n nThe fajitas arrived and they were fair. Portions were good and tortillas were fresh ish. For some reason the fajitas arrived with raw onions and a trace amount of bell peppers. Maybe i'm doing it wrong, but I was accustomed to grilled onions and peppers and this wasn't that. n nThe service was the shining star at this spot. Our server was awesome, very attentive and kind, without being annoying. I took my nephew and nieces out to dinner, and there were tons of extra requests, and the server Mike? was just really great so much so that I tipped 30 and let the manager on duty know they had a rock star working there. n nIf this place could just put some effort into the salsa, and a bit more attention to detail, it could be great, but for now I recommend you skip it, and hit up a Mom Pop spot.",1
"As per a friend's recommendation, who had been going here for 7 years, I gave the shop a call. I hate getting my haircut because most of the places I've gone to have either been overpriced or just terrible at cutting my thick wavy hair. This has not been the case at this shop. n nI have never been more blown away by a barber than Boris. When it comes to expertise and talent, he has it all. I don't even have to ask him what to do, he just cuts my hair and it comes out fantastic. His experience shows in his speed, accuracy, and knowledge. n nThe shop is clean, quaint, and classic. You walk in and are instantly greeted. It's a no bull atmosphere, complete with Frank Sinatra, a movie, or just hilarious conversation. It's what a good barbershop should be. n nI'm moving soon, and I'm frustrated that I'll have to, once again, find a barber. I doubt I'll find a place that will measure up to the experience this shop offers, and especially not at 19. Be a man, get your hair cut here.",2
Customer service is slow and lacking. I can't recommend anyone staying here. Pay a little more and get a place where people actually care.,1
"The Eiffel Tower is iconic and it lures you to come to the casino. In fact the going up the tower is cool and should be tried. But meanwhile, it alone this doesn't keep your interest up in sticking around. There is a hallway that connects it to Bally's, but who cares why would you want to go to a pathetically small boring casino and the shops in the hallway are equally unimpressive. Then the casino. Looks nice and big, but it's uneventful and boring. It just seems too sterile. Table dealers are not as friendly as the other casinos too. Slots seem old and tend to bore the seasoned players. I really don't find myself coming to this casino too often for these reasons.",1
"Did the Vaults tour today and it was pretty good. After seeing Edinburgh on Travel Channel TV shows I really wanted the visit. I opted for the vaults your because of it's haunted and creepy past. Tour guide Alex was very informative and enthusiastic. I wish it had gone gone more into the dark past to be honest, but I really did enjoy. For the hour or so I think it should have been cheaper.paying around u00a39 is a lot when you are converting to dollars and I think it would have been better if it was cheaper. n nI wanted to do the haunted tour but after being charged u00a39 for this one, I wanted to also eat dinner that night ",2
"Our dinner experience started out poorly here, as there was a mix up with our reservation. I was assured on three occasions that we could order solely off of the sushi menu at the teppanyaki table, as part of our party wanted teppanyaki, while part wanted only sushi. When we arrived, we found out that this was not the case, so we were forced to change our reservation and sit at a normal table. We sat without attention, menus, or water for a good 10 minutes, and finally had to flag somebody down to ask for menus. n nThe food was definitely not worth the price. My dish of scallops and lobster was mediocre, and the desserts were just ok. There were good parts of the meal, like the mochi ice cream and the sushi itself, but I would definitely not come back. There are so many other, better Japanese restaurants on the Strip.",1
"This place is a bit like stepping into a time machine and going back to the early 80's. n nThe decor is kitschy, and not in a fun way. The Tex Mex themed dining area is designed to be comfortable, but is definitely aimed to please simple folk in lower income brackets. Tableware and accoutrements are of the sort used in cafeterias. n nTo be fair, service was top notch and the restaurant was spotlessly clean. n nMy two star rating is mainly for the food. Very little on the menu is vegetarian. Many bean items contain lard. Anyone on a vegetarian diet, or trying to eat healthy will have problems finding anything to eat here. n nMost dishes appear to be old school Tex Mex classics like one would have found at a Texas beanery in the 1960's. There is nothing modern or innovative on the menu. n nSorry, but, the culinary world has moved on to bigger and better adventures. Most of us left this sort of food behind decades ago. If you have older relatives looking for simple, old school, lard filled Tex Mex this is the place to go. Otherwise, prepare to be seriously chagrined.",1
"My experience is this n nI heard the hype, wanted to taste the hype, could see the hype, didn't like the hype. n nI ordered one of the two barometer sandwiches for an Italian deli the meatball sub. The other is the Italian cold cut which I will try. n nPrice was OK, size was OK, bread was VERY good, meatballs were pretty good, sauce was MEH. n nThe real reason for the 2 star review, trust me I am not a hater, is that it came out cold. Not like NOT steaming hot, not luke warm but actually cold. n nIt was super packed and right at lunch time, just before noon so I would have expected it to be piping hot. n nI will try the Italian cold cut and may update this review to a more favorable one. For now, color me unimpressed.",1
"This should be a one word review Blaaah! However, I'll give STK it's due. Great atmosphere with sleek chrome and black leather. The service was great but the food was lackluster. We started with salads and I had the baby beet salad which was perfectly presented and the best thing I had this evening. n nMy colleague and I both ordered the 10oz filet and we shared the Yukon mashed potatoes, the Mac and cheese, and the asparagus with orange jalape u00f1o glaze. The steaks were very tender but lacked any real flavor, they were cooked to an exact medium rare. The Yukon mashed potatoes were a bit on the soupy side and had no form. The Mac and cheese was just that. It was like they took cooked macaroni and topped it with some cheese and baked it. It was not at all creamy and rich. My colleague and I both commented that we tasted neither orange nor jalape u00f1o in the asparagus sauce. n nOn a side note I tried to go to the restroom but the line was so long that I was told to come back later. I'm not really sure if the guy who told me that worked there or he just had to go really badly. n nFinally, there these three huge bouncer type guys who looked like they were in charge. As soon as the waiter brought the check I was signing when I heard one of these big mooks say to a group of four standing behind us, ""Yeah, these are your seats. I'm just waiting for these guys to get outta here. "" I thought it was very rude. From sit down to exit we were there an hour and five minutes. We spent over 120 each and we only had iced tea to drink. n nI'll be back in vegas next month and STK is on a list for us to consider for dining. I will strongly suggest that we spend our time and money somewhere else.",1
Basically a very expensive photo op. No cameras or phones. Expensive drinks. Cheap coats. I won't go again.,1
"I absolutely had the worst experience here, buying a sectional couch from here. I placed the manhattan sectional as a price hold. And made small payments as time went on. Last Friday 11 14 14 I was ready to pick up the couch and make my final payment of 433. Brianna was the cashier who ringed me up. When she pulled up my account she said I owed 122 instead of 433. I asked her if she was sure? And she said I only had to pay 122 and I was paid off. I noticed that she rang me up for one couch and not for both. When I mentioned this, she said I was ok and gave me my receipt. She then gave me the couch and I drove away. Later that evening I get a call from that same girl, stating that I was right and I owed 311. I told her that I was at work and I'm busy. I will come in and pay for it next week. Unbelievable that they would call me for there MISTAKE ! Today I receive a voice mail stating that they are going to call the police on me since I haven't paid the balance off. I called the manger Karen and told her that I will pay off today but I told her associate that I was going to pay the balance this week when I was off, which is today. There was no need for threats. She then treated me that I had to come under a hour to fix this or they were going to call the police. I live in Summerlin so I had to drive all they way the Windmill store with my 2 year old son. I went in and I spoke to Gilbert the furniture manager. I told him I was there to pay the balance off. He then gives me an attitude and lectures me stating that I knew I owed the balance and I was trying to get away with it. I could not believe he was telling this . When I said I just wanted to pay this off he, he snaps at me for having an attitude. He takes me to the cashier in from of the CUSTOMERS. And tells me I owe 433, I politely correct him told him that I owe 311, which stated on his cashier screen. He then snaps at me again and tells me not to correct him and to drop the attitude. I was standing there with my mouth open with my 2 year old son in my hands. Brianna the young lady who rung me up wrong then came up to Gilbert and told him I was ok and that she was going to charge me. Gilbert then threatens me that they were about to call the cops and I was Lucy that she was there to help me. I then told he to calm down and he curses at me in front of my infant son. I told him to leave the area because he was upsetting my young boy, and he kept yelling at me. Brianna told him to call down and leave. I was astonished that a MANAGER talked to me this way. Brianna apologized for his behavior and for her mistakes I understand that mistakes happen and was willing to let that go but not Gilbert behavior. I asked Brianna to speak to her manager Karen. But Karen was to busy to talk to me and help me with my issues. Brianna was nice enough to give me the District Managers number David. I called him and told him the incident that happened. He apologized and told me he would look on to it. Yea whatever! At least Brianna was nice enough to deal with the mistake she did, and took 10 off my due balance. I can't believe a store like this operates with employees like this. I'm still in shock a manager like Gilbert cursed at me and my two year old son. I will never set foot in another big lots again. I guess these people care more about them selves than own up to there mistakes. Especially the violent behavior Gilbert exhibited. I repeat this is not a family safe environment and they will CURSE IN FRONT OF YOUR KIDS. The a mangers and I guess the district manager in this case does not care about its customers. All I got was 10 off to drive all they way across town to settle a bill that was there ISSUE NOT MINE. And I got cursed at and threaten at. How nice. Never again will I go here. Please of you care about your kids do come here, when Gilbert's around.",1
"This is a Vietnamese Restaurant we found in the Little Chinatown part of of downtown Montreal. After attending the World Parkinson Conference at the Palais Congres de Montreal , we were hungry and was looking forward to some dinner. The restaurant had a simple modern decor about it and was spacious. Service was fast and efficient, and the place was very clean. Vietnamese food is one thing I can always rely on being consistent, and it was proven again with our dinner here. The soup bowls with noodles and thinly sliced beef were splendid, not too salty, piping hot and the noodles and slices of beef cooked perfectly. We also had the typical entire of pork chops over a bed of rice, and some Vietnamese fried egg rolls, all delicious. I love Pho! This was definitely a positive experience in Montreal Quebec!",2

"The restaurant was neat, I ordered pizza to go and the flavors were spot on! I got arugula, smoked prosciutto and mozzarella. I wish they cut up the toppings so it was easier to eat and I really really wish my pizza was cooked slightly longer. I don't want a droopy slice of pizza, I want cripsy thin crust! If it was cooked lover I would give it a 5. But I will try other pizza places before going back to soggy slices",2
I really like this place but wish it didn't close at 2 pm I'm not always good about taking my lunch at a reasonable time. n nI've had several sandwiches and wraps as well as their ceasar salad and I've been satisfied each time. n nThe service is usually very friendly.,2
im just confused on what the hell this place is trying to be.it looks all cool and modern on the outside.but the menu has low end sandwiches and then high priced steaks? The atmosphere inside is that of a fancy restaurant but it seems like an overdone chili's or applebees. The couscous was decent and their bread pudding is what made me give it the second star since it was made with croissants,1

They have the best Khow Soy outside of my mom's kitchen. They are the only Thai restaurant I've been to that has this yummy coconut based curry with a perfect blend of spices and they make it well. I will have to take my mom there to try it for the real test! Their service is great both for take out and dine in.,2
"This is the only place I go to buy my boards and gear. I tried going to Big5, but the quality is average at best. Sports Chalet is ok, but their prices are too steep and don't have the professional help and knowledge that is needed for you to find the right board and gear. Then there is Powder and Sun, my go to place for all my snowboarding needs. The staff is super helpful, friendly and extremely knowledgable because everyone that works there are boarders and have a passion for it.

I've been coming to this place for awhile now. It's close to where I live so it's nice. When I first started coming here I thought they did an awesome job. After the last time never again will I give them my business. I came in and there was 3 people working and only 1 other client. It took 30 mins for them to even start working on me. After telling the lady what I wanted over and over again I still don't think she got it. She kept getting up to talk to other employees and start cleaning then come back to me and look at my nails again and then get back up. After awhile she finally sat down and asked what I wanted again then when I told her she seemed to get angry and tell the other lady working there that she doesn't want to do it so somebody else has to. All I wanted was black tips which I didn't think was much to ask for. After all the awkward tension and the 2 hours of mostly sitting there waiting I will definitely not be coming back.,1
"Dont Waste Your Time! the bouncers are rude and dont know what they're doing, the VIP section is really small, and the music is nothing special. The place has potential, but there are so many other clubs in vegas worth going to before this one!",1
Our plan was to hit a bucket of Golf Balls and then have a beer or 2 and watch the NHL playoffs. To my surprise the beers were cheap and cold. The Bar Tender was very friendly and informative. He even let us pick the games we wanted to watch The surprise of the evening was how good the food actualy was. Very good for the price. Even the customers around us were great and friendly. I will definatly go back next year.,2
"Delicious! n nA nice flight of tequila to start things off. Very hard to choose what I wanted, menu is great. Went with the mahi and it didnt dissapoint. My friend got the pork in Chipotle bbq sauce with rice and beans which was just as good. n nLovely setting as well.",2
"If I could give NO stars, I completely would. I actually waited a while before I decided to leave this review, only because I hate to be a jerk. However, if I help sway someone to decide NOT to stay at Luxor, I'll sleep better at night. I stayed at this hotel last September while attending a trade show for work. We decided to go with it because it was on the less expensive side, and none of the people attending had ever stayed. The reviews looked decent, and we figured we wouldn't spend much time in the room anyway. Long story short, in the course of the two nights we stayed at the Luxor, we saw AT LEAST 15 cockroaches. COCKROACHES. Something I have never encountered at a hotel in my entire life. There were dead ones, live ones, and I even found one in my bag. Aside from this, the hotel itself is pretty run down, and you can spot trash lining the tops of the artificial buildings through out the hotel. I can almost guarantee that is what attracts many of the cockroaches. Ultimately, we did not stay the last night and were refunded the full amount of our stay. When we told the front desk, it was as if they were used to hearing people complain about cockroaches in the room. n nBottom line is, I would never stay at Luxor again, nor would I recommend it to anyone I know. Or don't know.",1
"Two girls, Saturday lunch the place was empty.really, on a Saturday afternoon? Why isn't this place better? It is so darn cute! n nLackluster, slow service. Mistakes with order even with more servers than tables occupied . Servers wanted to kick up their hills and chit chat. Ok, food.",1
"If you want to go to ""Go Raw Cafe "" make sure you go to the other location nwhat makes me unhappy here is n n1. I asked for a shot of wheatgrass and the person who took my order went to cut the glass and put it in the juicer without first putting on a glove. gross! n n2.I asked to pay first 3 times , two times she didn't respond and the last time she asked me to wait until the other girl is done preparing but she didn't even communicate that to the other girl. so I had to wait until I finished the meal. n n3. people working here not very helpful or friendly n n4. no salad bar like the other location n n5. I am not a vegan so I didn't know that the carrot soup is cold soup. and there's no mentioning of cold soup in the menu. I really didn't like it!",1
"This restaurant is by my place and I was hungry, so I went. To put it bluntly, go here for the food not the service. For me, service is the number one thing to look for in a restaurant. nI liked the food. The nachos were excellent. I just did not care for the service. Very rude service. They got the extra star because the nachos were slightly above par.",1
"Ok, ok, everyone knows it is Wal Mart and you aren't going there for the quality. Even so, it is a good place to get cheap stuff cheaply, so long as you have an hour to spend waiting in line. n nHowever, this may be the last time we go there for fresh produce. Or at least tomatoes. They were out on display but looked half rotted. And they were completely covered with either ants or fruit flies we didn't look closely enough to be sure but it was obvious that they weren't being cleared out or attended to at all.",1
"The prices at Dillard's Clearance Center can't be beat! I have found many a name brand item that I wanted in the regular Dillards show up here for about 1 4 the price. If you go on days when they have an ""extra "" percentage off, you make out like a bandit! The place is very well organized and clean for a clearance center. It is easy to find what you want in your size. I hate clearance centers that are disorganized! The only problem I have ran into is the dressing rooms. The attendants are not nice at all! They really seem to hate their job on 2 seperate occasions!",2
I stopped in for a quick bite one afternoon and had the tuna tartar was excellent and the caprese salad was very flavorful. I sat at the bar and the bar tenders were friendly and the service was great. Next time I am in town and I am going to try this place for dinner.,2
"Monday, October 3, 2011Secret Pizzeria at Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas n nI will start this review with the following disclosure The following Pizzeria does not exist. It has no menu, it has no website, it has no signs advertising a family meal deal. It is also not down a long hallway lined with old music album covers on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. It is not one of the best deals on the strip. It is also not the Best Pizza on the Strip. I HAVE KEPT THE SECRET. Now onto the food review. for the best pizza and best pizza deals in Vegas you need to find the secret Pizzeria at Cosmo. The cost is almost two dollars less per slice then any other pizza joint on the strip including my other favorite at the Wynn and the super thin crust , fresh taste and general New York ambiance just can't be beat. Although thin , the crust is still sturdy enough to bend without breaking and strong enough to hold any toppings. Speaking of toppings. unless you order ahead of time is there an actual number to the place? then you will be having your pizza topped with whatever the chefs whim is. There is no formal menu. On this day Simone and I had our choice of 5 different pizza pies. We both choose for our first slice portabello mushroom pizza with red sauce. With meaty fresh thin sliced mushroms, sweet fresh tasting marinara creamy mozzarella cheese and a crispy blistered crust this one was a winner. Savory till the last bite it leaves you wanting more. so I obliged. This time when I went back to the counter looking me in the face was a white pizza with fresh roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese and Olive Oil. This one may have been better then the mushroom. The crust was sauce less and had even more crunch. The garlic was sweet, the Ricotta Creamy and slightly melted and the Olive Oil was the icing on my pizza experience. nThe Pizzeria does not seem to offer any sides and I didn't ask because none were needed. They do have fountain drinks and beer. Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes can be found at the stand up bar that you can eat on. Without any other choices, The pizza definitely stands alone although three days later we went back and tried a cannolli for dessert and that was delicious as well . nNew York thin crust pizza is what its all about here at The Cosmopolitan, and these guys are the best at it.",2
"VERY overrated ! n nI read several reviews on Yelp and really was excited to take my friend here for dinner. What a disppointment! The server showed up twice once to TAKE our order, then the second time to ask if we wanted dessert and our bill. This is not what you call SERVICE. n nWe ordered the combo lamb and chicken skewer. The chicken was good but the lamb was extremely tough and full of fat. Of course we couldn't send it back and address the problem since the server failed to follow up. n nI ordered a martini straight up and it took over 45 minutes to receive it. When the bill came they charged me an UP charged since I asked for the normally included cranberry as a SPLASH on the side. When i asked the server about this charge on the bill, she said that since the cranberry was presented with ICE they had to pour more liquor.I didn't ask for ice.just a splash that I could mix in. They normally include cranberry, chambord, pineapple, and more for the same inclusive price to this martini so this was not an upcharge which was justified. n nHeads up to those thinking about coming here. You can go to several restaurants that offer excellent chicken beef and quality lamb skewers that are better quality and much more reasonable. It's clear that The PR doesn't focus on this. n nSuggestion, Offer more reasonable portions for less and offer more attentive service. There's obviously a problem when 100 of the tables are taking food to go and paying top dollar for a meal that simply isn't worth it.",1
"Very sad to discover that their signature bread and fries are now just like every other bar. I'm glad they were able to stay open, but, these were the things that made it unique. Bummer that they couldn't maintain that standard.",1
"Nothing has changed, same boring food and same nonsense in the store area.",1
"This place has the best Pulled Pork sandwich I have ever had. The pork was juicy, wasn't very messy and a lot of flavor. I will definitely be back!",2
"I saw the sign of ""Quality the first time "" in their window so I had high hopes for my wife's car repair. After a couple of weeks between Geico and Caliber blaming each other, we got the call to pick it up. It had blemishes that needed to be buffed out. They were nice and asked if she could come back the next day and pick it up. She did. When I got home, we examined the hood and found over 50 bubbles, blemishes, specs within the clear coat. She called back and they said they would correct it and provide a rental. They did. A few days later she picked it up and their original friendliness had now subsided and basically couldn't get her out fast enough. Definitely not quality the first time. The end result is still not stellar but just not worth the hassle to deal with it. Yes, the provided a rental but they fail to grasp the level of interuption and hassle this imposes on the customer. Based upon other comments, possibly this was an anomaly but I cannot recommend this place. There are just too many options out there to endure this experience.",1
"Sizzlers is as good as it gets ! n nWe have been going to Sizzlers for many of years because their food tastes excellent and the value is out of this world. n nPrices have gone up about a 1 2 so that will humble you real quick if you haven't visited for awhile. n nHowever, they have a great lunch special that includes your drink and salad bar for a low price of about 9.99 I believe. n nThey also have express lunch pricing as well. n nAt dinner your salad is still included but you have to pay 2.50 for a drink and for a family of four that is 10 extra dollars ! Uh, no thanks ! H2O for the fam bam please !",2
"Unfortunately this place probably won't survive long, cause the service is horrible. When we were greeted they didn't welcome us but rather asked if we've been helped I would have thought it was pretty obvious since we were just standing there that we hadn't been helped . We then had to ask for bread and water cause no one came around to serve us any. As a matter of fact the waiter came to our table a total of 3 times drink food order, bring our food, and lastly to give us the bill . We were never asked how our wine was or even if we would like a second round. He also never asked how our food was. The waiter sat at the bar and watched football while we sat in confusion. I found it funny when we did get the bill that he lingered close to our table waiting for us to pay and go. Even though the food was good, it doesn't make up for the bad service. Someone else wrote MIA. MISSING IN ACTION servers. I couldn't agree more!",1
By far this is the best barber shop in the south west. Ask for Alex,2
"Unfortunately, the first time I walked into this store, I was ""greeted "" by nasty stares from the employees. After 10 minutes of walking around the store I decided I would wait at the desk for assistance with registry for my wedding. I waited five minutes, had about 3 4 employees walk by without saying a word and no help. I was so unsettled by this, I felt like I was invisible! I am never one to complain, so I decided to give this store a try again today while I was at the mall. Once again, I walk in, no greeting, no smiles, and worst of all after even asking for help, I was ignored! I am younger, and do not know if the employees thought I would just be ""wasting "" their time by trying to help me and never make a sale, or if they were simply just lazy. Either way I was astonished by the behavior and attitudes I received.",1
Overall great experience. The mixed seafood ceviche was amazing! I wish the portion was a bit larger. I would definitely come back! I also tried the paella which was also delicious.,2
"These guys are awesome. They have great prices and always get the work done fast. I am a newer rider and they are always really patient with me. They answer all of my questions, and don't make me feel like an idiot for asking. They're always joking around and having a good time so every visit is an adventure. n nThe best part about this place is that they are honest. There have been many situations over the last year where stuff has come up, or I've had questions, and I always feel like I get an honest answer. This is something that can't be over valued. I've heard the owner, Scott, tell people many times that he doesn't throw parts at a problem. They want to make sure they understand what the issue is, and fix it right the first time. n nI have a lot of respect for these guys, and as long as I'm living in the valley no one will touch my bike except them.",2
"Eek is right.not sure what all of the rave reviews are about?! nSaturday afternoon lunch.none of the employees looked happy to be there. No real greeting, took a long time to be seated, and then the service was horrendous! A solid 10 minutes of sitting, another 10 minutes to get drinks, and then all the food was on the table before we had silverware. nDuring the meal, we had 4 or 5 different waitresses, people bringing random things at different times, and orders had to be verified 3 times. I ordered the southwest chicken salad, which came with a mini quesadilla. Somehow, I was the last one to be served. nSome things looked smelled good, but the salad was a little limp, the fruit was slimy, and there were no refills. nOn a happy note, prices are decent cheap.",1
"Absolutely nothing to write home about. I did not have to pay cover, since we came before 10PM, but when we left and got the stamps to re enter at a later time the bouncer checked our ID's for a long 5 minutes as if he knew what he was doing. I could probably take it as an compliment since we looked all so young? nMusic soso, Waitress took forever to come.wouldn't go again",1
"Suite 301, you're still that crappy bar that resided there before you aka Owls Nest . So much to offer with no effort, yet they cant accomplish this perfect canvas. This place would be super dope if they would have done it right. n n Sidebar Keep the beefy chicks off the brass poles. Thanks.",1
Ok I have to update. Took another forever to get our bill back and it was the wrong freakin bill. Whatever. It was the same ish cost so we finally paid and are leaving 5 hours later.,1
"Our server was great but the Kitchen failed miserably. Ordered a Lumberjack slam with French toast and some well cooked hash browns. What I got was a Lumberjack slam with under cooked hash browns and soggy French toast, the ham was cold, the sausage was not fully cooked, and I didn't even get my toast! The waiter apologized as they were extremely busy. I didn't think it was his fault anyway, when I was pretty much done with my meal the waiter said my new side of French toast still was not done bread was frozen . So he offered a free desert instead, which I thought was nice but then he brought it out and the fudge was all chunky. So needless to say the food was disgusting, but my server was nice. Wouldn't recommend it the server deserved stars for his service but the kitchen deserved negative 5 stars.",1
"What is it with this place? Since moving to the valley over 18 months ago my daughters have been enamored with this place. Actually it is starting to wane, thank God. n nHow are these things all over the place? Can't we make them get back to the mall food courts where they belong? They are the McDonald's of Chinese food aren't they? When I lived back east we didn't let these McChinese places get out of hand. n nValley residents have obviously not put them in their place in the scheme of things. n nBad Chinese food fast!",1
"Bark Avenue Pet Resort is right next to Bark Avenue Pet Supply as well as Bark Ave Hospital, super convenient. I have been searching for an alternative to our mobile groomer recently based on budget cuts, cutting the dog's expenses means less cutting of mine n n I HATE grooming my dogs because it seems so unnatural I hate them being lathered in products, especially scented ones, ew but between the little one getting dread locks and the bigger one having some weird curling dew claw toenails, it is sadly necessary. Bark Avenue uses more ""eco friendly "" products than most and every time I have gone in there the people are SUPER nice. n nToday was their first time being groomed there and it was the best haircut my little dog has ever had! Most of the time he looks ridiculous and some groomers do a poof ball on his head he is not a poodle, he is a Bichon Pomeranian or cut his face too short or don't cut enough off of his ears but the guy at Bark Avenue Sergio got everything just right! The big dog just gets shaved so he couldn't really mess that up, but regardless, she looked beautiful too! We will definitely be going back and as far as price it was 82 ideally it would have been 70 for both as opposed to 110 with our mobile groomer so definitely still an improvement!",2
"Don't bother calling. The guy who said they are ""on time and target "" must have an extremely slow watch. They don't start your sandwich till you get there no matter how busy they are. They always seem to be confused as to what's going on. I'm not a Capriotti's owner but I would think it would be wise to at least have 1 person in charge instead of three try hards. n nI guess the best deal. I'f you could even call it that would be a large sandwich a bag of chips and a soda to split with someone. But even then it's going to set you back almost 21 bucks. n nSplitting is still expensive",1
I come here often but lately the lack of intelligent staff has me going elsewhere. I can't stand spending my money when the people you buy from are rude and treat you as if you should know where everything is. If you can't assist me in locating what I need odds are I won't return. Don't even think about coming when it's close to closing time they shut down their stations and don't announce they are closing. And will proudly tell u im sorry we are closed we forgot to lock the doors or announce it. I love tjm don't get me wrong it's this location that just sucks.,1
"Horribly run business. They took money out of my account without my permission, i spent hours on the phone and they told me they would credit my account but i wouldnt recieve all my money back. No one would help me or return my phone calls.",1
If I could give a negative 5 starts I would! Been here 3 times and wait time was over an hour and a half. Absolutely Ridiculous. Will never return and not recommend!,1
"YIKES. We had a very bad experience here, unfortunately. n nI went for a work trip and you can't imagine the thrill I had knowing we were staying in the same hotel that Britney is preforming at the teenage girl in me is still star struck but honestly, I've never had a worse experience in Vegas. The first day our room wasn't even ready when we arrived, by the third day our room hadn't been cleaned once, and the fourth day our neighbors took it upon themselves to hotbox their hotel room which led to the vent pumping their smoke into our room. At first the hotel did NOTHING about our neighbors and told us that this was impossible. Finally after much pestering they sent a secutriy guard up who immediately confirmed our suspicion and told the front desk to move us. They then refused to give us adjoining rooms like we had reuqested when we booked the hotel and didn't even offer us a discount despite spending 5 nights there! n nTerrible, terrible, terrible!",1
"I had this in Atlanta during a 45 min layover and thoroughly enjoyed the Western Burger 4 on the menu , so I was super excited to see its here in LV. Def one of my faves, I joke w my friends the Im in love w a sandwich.",2
"During the day this place is acceptable, just to be served by a great guy named Ralph. He is a very cool senior with such a big heart. n nThe reason for the one star is that the service is so bad. If you are in a hurry go to the drive thru, that is where they focus their attention and pretty much ignore the guests in the lobby. However, you will get your food fast, just accept the fact that your order might be wrong. n nThis McDonald's is very close to our house and we sometimes stop in late night to get ice cream from the drive through. The service at night is beyond bad. They always have a difficult time giving back the correct change, the orders are wrong. n nThe one thing that really stands out is the way they shove your food order at you in the drive through. We like the ice cream cones, you would think that if I am in the drive thru in my truck and I order ice cream, that you might want to take a little bit of care in making the cone. Like clock work, they start handing me ice cream cones shoving at me is more like it the cones are dripping and the ice cream is falling off the cone. I really don't want melted ice cream spilled all over, I asked for a napkin, the girl replied ""there is paper around the cone "" n nFor some reason, I keep thinking the service will be better at night, it never is. n nIf you want some late night entertainment, go though the drive thru at night. You must bring your sense of humor,Don't say, I didn't warn you.",1
Horrible! Waited 40 minutes on a Wednesday at 2 pm. there was a line out the door and only 3 tables were taken. no one came up to us for 15 minutes and he was rude and dirty. waitress was rude and had dirty fingernails. she kept sighing and grunting and would just throw stuff on our table. hamburger was served raw. Literally RAW. Won't even go on about it. Ruined appledbees for me forever. Stay AWAY!,1
"I brought Willow the pug in for a self clean and nail trim. She wasn't a fan of being tethered to the tub and was pretty afraid of the dryer, but all that aside we had a successful bathing experience. Wash Wednesday is only 10 and we had her nails trimmed for an additional 3. Afterwards we picked out some treats 1 2 each and were assisted in picking out a toy her new favorite though it's already on a path to complete destruction . Their food prices are higher than some other local stores, and the average toy price is 10 but the service was great and she even got a treat for being extra cute. I'll definitely be coming back.",2
Good food and good atmosphere. Great place to stop by for a breakfast or lunch sandwich!,2
"My friends and I usually go to Tofu Hut to get our kbbq fix, but we decided to try this place out after another friend of ours went. It's located in the same shopping center as Ichiza and Tea Station. We came in and were seated right away. The dining area is pretty big and we really enjoyed the ambiance. n nThere were three different AYCE options Nevada, Vegas, and Spring Mountain. We went with Nevada. First, we ordered brisket, pork belly, and steamed egg. It came with the house salad and your typical KBBQ starters kimchi, broccoli, tofu, etc. . I thought the salad was okay. The waitress quickly brought out the brisket and pork belly. The brisket was delicious, which was enough to seal the deal for us. Pork belly and steamed egg were good, but not amazing. We also ordered the marinated chicken halfway through. The chicken wasn't my favorite, there wasn't much flavor to it. n nTo sum it up, the AYCE kbbq was a good experience. My friends and I will definitely come back again, mostly for the delicious brisket. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. We even watched as the owner played 'happy birthday' on the clarinet for another table, which we thought was cute. One downside would have to be that they close at 11, so late night kbbq here is not an option.",2
First of all came here for brunch and it was over priced! Everything I wanted on the menu they did not have plus the food was under cooked. The waiter George tried his best and very positive he was the best Server in this place as far as the rest of the service terrible! The bartenders never asked us if we would like more drinks i also experienced another group asking them for help. Whn she only showed attention to one group being that there was only 3 groups in the place. George again was what customer service is made the rest of the staff terrible and rude just like their food,1
"A business colleague and I were visiting Phoenix and when we asked for dinner recommendations, St. Francis was one of two. The local pointed out that St. Francis largely uses locally bought veggies, in particular, while also having great food. n nWalking into St. Francis, it's clearly an eclectic, fun environment. The menu is just as attractively unusual and every appetizer, drink and dish we ordered was delicious and full of flavor. n nThe goat cheese appetizer wasa good the meatball appetizer was great. The almond margarita was unique, tasty and strong. We also had the roast chicken and pork chop both were excellent. It seemed a little unusual to have just a piece of chicken on the plate, but the ""sides "" were under the chicken, and on top. The flavor was amazing the fresh veg made all the difference. n nThe service was friendly and attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and ready with recommendations. We happened to go at happy hour, which features an impressive range of options bonus! n nCan't wait to return to St. Francis next time I'm in Phoenix.",2
OK so i gave them 5 stars. They probably should have gotten 4 or 4.5 but they really don't deserve the low scores they have and I wanted to boost their rating. The show is fabulous. I thought the dancers were very attractive. They have men and women dancers so there is enough eye candy for anyone. The guys were especially sexy. The singers were very good. The dancers were very good. The venue was great. Sound was perfect. I love disco so I had a smile the entire time. I loved the show and will repeat on a girls night out. These performers gave it their all. They stayed in character with huge smiles the entire time. nI have been to almost all of the variety singing dancing shows and this one is as good or better than all of them.,2
"Bogus forced wait for 30 min. 15 empty tables but scam delay and ""recommendation "" to wait in bar. Nice effort to drive the revenue up. n nNot cool guys. Suddenly table became available 5 minutes after NOT going to the bar. n nFood and service good overall. Just not happy with hostess.",1
"We had diner in a private room which is pretty cool, and well, private duh . It has it's own bar and it's a great spot for parties or I guess for a romantic date there're no cameras, I believe, lol . n nThe food was good, like in between of good and really good not outstanding, though . n nThe service was great and friendly, but I guess this is irrelevant when it comes to a private room, I mean, if you get bad service there, the place just sucks! n nWe tried several dishes and i can't remember anyone that I didn't like. n nThe salad with steak was tasteful, the fondue was really good as well as the mac cheese, maybe one of the best mac cheese that I've eaten recently. n nThe pork belly was good too. n nShort rib, steal head and filet were solid but not memorable. The filet was a little hard, if you ask my opinion but it was cooked right, which is hard to find in AZ. n nThe apple pie was also pretty good and a normal serving, not the typical ""feed 10 "" disgusting kind of desert. n nGreat place for parties, dates or just friends dinner. n nIt worth the try.",2
"Omg! I'm so upset that so how rude I was beening treated, I went in there for shoes clothes. I found one that I liked so I was holding one shoe and asked the lady well first, she was ignoring me when I went up to her she pretended that she was doing something when matter affect she look dumb running left to right behide the cash register when I finally get her attention and asked to try to shoe in my size, you told that the one I'm holding in my hand IS my size. UNBELIEVABLE! I was so pissed off I drop the shoe and walk out. I'm so sad because I love their stuff. ",1
"The veal porterhouse served rare is probably the juiciest, tenderest steak I've ever had. Really flavorful too. n nDon't get too many appetizers, we got crab legs, crab cakes, and a bunch of others thinking they would be small, but some of the appetizers are big enough to be entrees for multiple people. You will not be able to eat your steak if you get too many. n nService is really great, very attentive and friendly without being disruptive at all.",2
"Underwhelming service, and sub par facilities.",1
"ASK ABOUT PRICES BEFORE SERVICES! n nThe first time I came here, I loved it and left paying 55 for a pedicure and gel manicure. The next time it was more . I went a 3rd time, and I left paying 70! It was ridiculous for a pedicure and gel manicure. I came from San Francisco and prices there aren't that crazy. Especially for a gel polish change! Make sure you ask About pricing and services before. That way they don't charge you more than expected. Also, If you want JUST a nail color change it's 25. If you want them to file, cut cuticles and attend to your nails be ready to pay over 40! They do an ok job, but I am in search for a better location.",1
"Good food, good service and a great view of the Strip. n nWe will return next time we have a hankering for authentic Mexican food.",2
Good morning dim sum! Good place to eat out in LV. I love that they have push carts. Don't like ordering off the menu. I'm a visual person so was a score. Definitely come here again.,2
"Sucks! Why did it take an hour to get our food? Why did people's orders get out of order? It was probably a bad day, but they did nothing to make us want to come back and see how a potentially normal day is there. n nThe food's ok. n nOne a positive, I actually got to hear a black guy from one group of people tell another black guy in another group have this exchange n n ""Hey, that's nacho cheese! "" n n ""Yeah, that's what I ordered "" n n ""Yeah, but that's not yo's. It's my nacho cheese! "" n nAnd the whole restaurant burst into laughter.

I think 3 things about Francis Sons Car Wash n1 J.D. who wrote that review had to be the owner manager because he should have taken out a 1 minute commercial with 31 pictures of the car wash!

Also if u get a loyalty shirt you get a medium popcorn everytime , u can upgrade to a large for only 1 and then bring the bag back next time for a FREE Popcorn ! nNeedless to say we see All The movies now all the time !",2
"Had an awful experience with Jimmy Woos. I wish I would have written this review a few weeks ago when it happened but it slipped my mind until just now. I group of us from work got take out from here and while I know take out leaves more room for error, this was incredible. I got a kids meal because I wanted a little bit of everything and the dessert included. I got the shrimp lo mein that came with beef instead of shrimp, they charged me for the fried rice which was supposed to be included, and they didn't even give me my dessert which I was so excited about. Luckily I work with nice people so one of them went back to the restaurant for me to tell them how they completely messed up my order and they took off the fried rice charge and gave us a free dessert but just too much had gone wrong to recover me so I probably won't be back. Sorry Jimmy Woos. I really did want to like you!",1
"Apparently, I've been away too long. n nI BRAG about how BlueBerry Hill has the BEST Tuna Melts EVER. So I go today, order my Big o Tuna Melt on Rye jack cheese please . It arrives looking all I remember it to be, so I take a bite. Hummm, the tuna tastes a little weird. So I take another bite and think, ""Crap, they added stinkin' sweet pickle relish to their tuna. "" I tear apart the sandwich and yes, there they are.little stickin chucks of sweet pickle relish. I called over my waitress and sent the sandwich back. n nPLEASE go back to ""purist "" tuna salad.MAYO, CELERY and Albacore Tuna ONLY. n n No Egg, No stinkin Pickle relish and especially, NO miracle whip . If you REALLY want to make an impression, mix up the tuna to order. Start with ""Purist "" tuna salad and if someone else wants that other crap in their tuna salad, it can be added in before serving. n nI had anticipated my treat of a Blueberry Hill Tuna Melt ALL morning, just to have my hopes dashed by tuna salad ruined by needless extra ingredients. n nJulie, my waitress at the Green Valley location was very sweet and understanding that I sent the sandwich back. The chicken noodle soup I had before the sandwich was wonderful and my companions totally enjoyed their meals. BTW, Julie gets FIVE stars. n nPlease tell me when you go back to the original tuna recipe and I will rush on fleeted foot back to BlueBerry Hill.",1
Run like hell! worst card ever in 40 years of owning credit cards. big rip off! shame on them! they say that they have been sending me statements when i have never received one in 8 months after verifying my name and address over 20 times with them. i get all of my mail and there is nothing wrong with my post office yet they insist that the statements are being mail. they are not being mailed! it is as simple as that and they refuse to find out why. they charge 25.00 dollar late penalties for paying early! they hope you will pay by phone so the can charge you 9.00 dollars every time. does anyone else have this problem?,1
Cheap food inside Planet Hollywood that is not bad. Me and my friend tried different sandwiches and found it to be pretty good and for about 6 bucks you cant get any better. n nSandwiches are run through a toaster like at Quiznos and came out nice and toasty. We ordered the sandwiches by name and liked what came on the sandwishes standard.,2
"Hertz here is awful, worst I've ever seen. 50 people in line, four behind the counter. Don't nSeem to care.line is longer than my flight! Buses keep delivering people. Could it be that it's a surprise that a lot of people show up at 2 00, wanting to pick up cars they paid for. Cost is not worth this aggravation, I beg you to go somewhere else .again, worst I have ever seen.",1
"Medium rare ordered.well done received. Disappointing for a 50 plus steak. I don't send food back to the kitchen, it frightens me. Slice of pizza will be ordered in a bit.",1
"Food great, service great, but the restaurant was filthy. Workers standing around talking while every table was dirty, floor and soda counter disgusting. I was there 45 minutes and no one made a move to clean anything.",1
"I've been coming here for several years. I have seen Dr. White, Max Smith, and Jeanine. nI mainly come in for my annual physical exam and bloodwork. They are very detailed and hygienic inside this office. And I love not having to drive anywhere else for blood work or for xrays. n nA few years ago I fell on my wrist and thought nothing of it. Yet, a few days later I couldn't even wash my hands without pain in my left hand. I immediately called and made an appointment because I knew something was wrong. They got me in on the same day. And what was nice, Dr. White sent me straight to the xray before even seeing me, which cut down on my wait time. Thank God it was only a strain and not a fracture. nYet, I noticed it was still painful several days later so I came back in. My hand was still swollen I could barely get my ring off my finger and usually it is so loose on me . Max noticed bruises on my arm and asked about those in a concerned fashion. I was pleased with how they were concerned, but those who know me well, know I bruise easily and often don't even know where I get my bruises from. n nI rarely get sick, or at least sick enough to require medical treatment that isn't all natural, so I don't even know if I have been to this office for any ""sick "" visits, however a few months back I had a nasty skin infection. n nI went to a place for threading that apparently wasn't the most hygienic. I had this bad infection on my face and even my lip was swollen from the infection. I called and they once again got me in on the same day. I saw Jeanine this time. I told her I think I had a skin infection and just one look and she confirmed my suspicions. It was severe enough to require two antibiotics, one oral and one topical. I still have some discoloration on my skin, but it is starting to fade. I also told Jeanine that I was going to Mexico and she wrote me a prescription for antibiotics to take down there in case I got the dreaded diarrhea. n nThe only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because I sometimes have a hard time getting a hold of the drs for a medical question. For instance, I needed a good doctor for that annual female exam and no one returned my call, so I had to use Google, and thank God I think I found the best dr. in the valley for that aspect. I don't know if Dr. White has ever returned a call to me, so I'm not too certain that his assistant gives him messages. I just hope they get their patient portal working again, because he did return emails.",2
"This is by far my worse hotel stay horrible customer service, old and disgusting rooms and elevators that don't work. In fact we got stuck in one! The restaurants are slow and their system always seems to be broken so they could not give us our bill! But by far the worse is the location of the shuttle pick up. Impossible to find because its in the back in a creepy alley where it feels like you will get shot or robbed. No one knows anything or can answer questions. Basically ruined my vegas experience.",1
"Whoa, how have I not reviewed this place? I've checked in like 7 times! Thai Style Noodle House 2 is pretty decent Thai food and pretty decent prices. It's not my favorite Thai place in Las Vegas, but that doesn't stop me from frequenting this place. n nTheir curry selection is pretty cool. They've got avocados and pumpkin in their curries, which reminds me of Pan Asia. I've also sampled the pad thai and a yummy noodle dish that has chicken, tofu, shrimp, squid, and just a bit of everything in it. Their garlic pork is very flavorful, and their spice levels are right on point. I kept hearing about this beef jerky that they have, but I didn't like it. Really tough and burnt. n nThe service is quick and friendly. I definitely recommend this place to my Yelp friends!",2
Love love love Poke Express! It's so good! I've never had any complaints and I go quite often. I even get other friends and family to try if they've never had poke before. They love it as well! My favorite is the spicy ahi tuna but love all their kimchee pokes too. Mussel and tako are my favorites. Fish has always been fresh!,2
"If you like dark, grimy, awful music and burgers not worth their price come here! Waitress took the change for our bill out of her wallet and it took her 30 minutes to get us our burgers with three tables in the whole place. DO NOT GO HERE!",1
Make sure you bring a book. We were advised to show up 30 minutes early for paperwork. Our appointment was at 11 45. At 11 45 we were called to fill out paperwork. That's ok things happen. At 12 15 I asked what we were still waiting. Finally got in at 12 45! Totally unexceptable,1
"I ordered brake pads from the online store to be picked up at this location by my partner. Because I wasn't going to be picking them up, I had to call the online customer service to arrange it. n nEasiest call ever. Except for the questions they ask to verify who you are. I can barely remember yesterday, much less an address I used 15 years ago. But luckily you only have to do that once. n nWhen my partner walked into this location to pick up the pads, she told them why she was there, and they greeted her by name, had everything ready, and she was in and out of there in 5 minutes. n nIt's great when good customer service makes things go smoothly.",2
Went to this place after I drove by a couple of times.totally not what I expected when I walked in.but can't judge a book by its cover!ordered the chicken sandwich and it was awesome!great grilled chicken with awesome fresh baked bread!highly recommend! Will try a dessert next time as they look yummy!,2
"I knew Leticia's Mexicana Cocina made my top 702 Happy Hour locations, but I learned something new today. The restaurant meets my standards for being a kid friendly dining spot. 1 Friendly, attentive staff. 2 Homemade chocolate milk. Horchata is on the menu too. 3 Kid's menu and crayons. 4 Children like to watch the food set up on the kitchen line. 5 Booth seating. nGreat Blanco Pozole today!",2
"excellent for sandwiches, quick service. Jerk chicken was really good.",2
the late night breakfast was very good. We all could not stop moaning with pleasure over the potato cakes.,2
"I brought in the comforter from my guest room because our new puppy peed on it. Without getting an authorization to wet clean, they washed it to get the stain out. Stain is gone, but my guest comforter is ruined.",1
Absolutely fantastic place for breakfast.,2
"I instantly decided to try this place ever since I saw Man vs food on food network. We ordered 2lb of shrimps, 1lb of crawfish, and deep fried calamari. Everything we ordered was really flavorful, fresh and tasty. I love the ""hot and juicy "" sauce came with shrimps. It made me nonstop eating rice! I felt very guilty after eating so much carb. I think I will only shrimps next time because it's just not worth it to order craw fishes with not much meat in there. Overall, I think this is a fun place to eat with your hands and enjoy very tasty seafood.",2
"Read lots of good reviews from Yelp, and went with my wife. nwe did not like it because n they just massage on your body without knowing how what they are doing. A good massage make you feel good pain during and great afterward. Their massage makes you feel nothing during and afterward. n They asked for 30 of tips. This is the very first time ever that the massagers ever asked for the tips of 30 ? I give them 20 and they keep insists they need more . n n Pros n the base fee is not expensive there are better deal in San Jose, 15 for 1 hr. with better massage n n Cons n No a good massage n Ask too much tips 30 n Cash only",1
I moved to phoenix from oahu hawaii and heard great things about this place. They had Hinano on tap which reminded me of home. The coconut shrimp rolls were ono. The sashimi and poke were also good. Except the sashimi was not properly cut and the presentation could have been better. I had the Bali hai mango ribs which were very very good. The coleslaw needs some work and the sweet potato fries were broke da mouth good. The service was good and friendly. Definatly comming back for another visit,2
"Greg is extremely knowledgable and helpful. Work was completed promptly and correctly. Highly recommended for taxes, payroll, and any accounting need for the small business owner!",2
We just left the MGM after enjoying 3 great nights! This was our first time staying here and we were pleasantly surprised! Usually when we come to Vegas we stay at Caesars properties but wanting to try something different I booked through MLife. We got such a great rate on our grand king room. When we checked in I asked if we could have a higher floor and the fd agent was more than accommodating. He got us a room on the 27th floor which was perfect! The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable! We never had any issues with extra charges and they even waived the late check out fee for us! It is a little far from where we're use to stay on the strip but the monorail is super easy and not pricey. Can't wait to stay here again!,2
"Having been a little disappointed in our go to burger joint near Shadyside during our last few visits, we came to the Burgatory, and it far exceeded my expectations. We started with the truffle oil and gorgonzola fries AMAZING. I also started with the Burnt Almond Torte shake since I love Prantl's Burnt Almont Torte. This was very good as well. As my entre, I tried the Phat Patti's Vegie burger. Between the fries and the shake I was pretty full at this point so I didn't eat much, but I enjoyed what I had. As you can probably guess, the shakes are filling so if you plan to get one, come hungry or consider passing on the appetizer although I know I will never be able to pass on the truffle fries . n nMy one complaint is that there was way too much whipped cream on the shake the whipped cream took up 1 3 of the glass , but it came with a ""refill "" cup so there was still plenty of shake to drink if you could make it through the whipped cream.",2
I have been seeing Shila for over 4 years! She is absolutely AMAZING! I'm so very happy for her. The staff is awesome! Very friendly and all do a wonderful job shaping eyebrows! It is very clean and always smells so fresh! I recommend that everyone stops by Shila's,2
"We agree with others that the bagels are average, definitely not superior. Better bagels can be found in Scottsdale at Big City Bagels. The food is generally expensive for this type of fare. The hours are nice for those who want to get an early start to the day they open at 5 30 AM . The owner likes to keep it pretty chilly in the restaurant. Their excuse is that the workers are warm. Never mind the customers I guess. Also, they have the music jacked up too loud making it difficult to hold a conversation or relax and read the paper with a sandwich, coffee, and paper. We also didn't like the fact that in the December 2013 restaurant inspections, they had seven violations. By far the most of any other restaurant rated in the paper for that month. Just by looking at the place it's pretty easy to tell why that is. Not overly clean and not much attention given to the ambiance.",1
"This place is just bad. We were delayed over 5 hours coming home from Vegas and needed somewhere to eat lunch. Decided on this place and was not the best idea. n nOrdered chips and salsa the chips were not fresh, not even close to Tostitos quality. They were just bland bagged tortilla chips and the salsa was so watery and flavorless. n nI ordered tacos with carne asada and I would have enjoyed a can of dog food more than I enjoyed this. The meat was really gross and the rice tasted like soggy nothing. n nDon't go here. You're better off going to Burger King.",1
Place is just okay. n nWent here a couple times. Beer on tap was very good. Food and service was so so. My main issue would be I got this hostess number there and she didn't show for the date. Who hires people like that? n nPros n Good beer n Nice atmosphere n Plenty of TV's n nCons n flaky staff,1
"Tried once, because it's close to home. The interior is dirty, which sometimes means good food think pho so 1, your local favorite taqueria or strip club or really bad food China Joe's . n nThe plain noodles are really just sugar noodles. The beef chow fun is slimy and the noodles stick together, beef is bad quality and overly chewy. The vegetables taste sub par and not so fresh. What do you expect for 5 6? A lot more than that China Joes. I guess all they are competing with is the scary Chinese buffet in the next shopping center, but never again.",1
"The ice cream here is delicious, but the service is horrendous. There always seems to be 10 people working here, yet they often seemed annoyed to have patrons. n nThis place is adorable, and has deep roots in old Az. Come on, Sugar Bowl, step it up a little.",1
I just ran into to Firebird to see if they can help with some tires for a 1977 School bus.of course they could. n nThey gave me a heck of a deal and had it ready the next day.,2
I've had better pizza in airports. The sauce is too sweet and crust not crisp enough. Pass!,1
I want you guys to keep in mind that I downloaded the yelp app just to rant about this terrible place. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and it literally tasted like how old people smell. I'm never going there again unless it's to catch up with an ex girlfriend.,1
"I agree with everything that Max A. said about this place. n nI went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call. If you are turned on by watching some pale anorexic looking girl wearing a gas mask dance on a bar, then this place is for you. If you like bad hair, white belts and crappy tattoos, this is also right up your alley. I wanted to grab some of the girls in here and just give them sandwiches and some sunshine and tell them that their Daddy did love them. n nI won't be going back here, its just depressing.",1
"This show was fantastic. I highly recommend it to everyone. It was act after act of pure enjoyment. The price of the ticket was a huge value for what we saw. If you are going to see the show, this is defiantly one you don't want to go cheap on the tickets. n nI didn't follow the whole storyline but I really wasn't there for the story. I wanted to see the acts that the performers did. Wow! Was it worth it. Just when you thought an act couldn't be topped, another performance outdid the previous one. n nThe clowns that did perform between the acts were pretty funny and did keep you laughing throughout the show. n nI saw Mystere in Las Vegas and felt that this was better. n nDon't miss this opportunity to see it while they are here.",2
"I picked this restaurant for an out of town dinner based on the Yelp reviews, and was very disappointed. I don't know if everyone else here just came on a better night with a different staff or what, but this was not the dining experience you all described. The food was just OK, not awesome or Earth shattering. We had a variety of appetizer plates mac n cheese, crab cakes, chicken waffles that were way overpriced and just average at best. We didn't get the pork belly because they wouldn't serve it without the sauerkraut made from brussel sprouts!?! seriously? The server also raved about the drinks there and the ""awesome mixologists "" but the bar selection was tepid no Sapphire, only Beefeater? and they couldn't even make a mojito? I know that can be a 'specialty' drink in some areas but we saw plenty of them on other menus around Scottsdale. But the worst was the service and attitude of the staff we were IGNORED all night. The server was affable and friendly but would disappear for long stretches of time. 20 minutes to get drinks, when the bar wasn't busy? And our appetizers took almost twice that long to appear. He also forgot the bread, and didn't ask about another round of drinks until we were ready to leave! The place was a little busy but hardly packed it was after 9pm , so we couldn't figure out what was going on. It seemed like everyone working there was more concerned with enforcing the cool hipster vibe than actually doing any work. Except for the hostess whose job apparently involved stomping through the restaurant periodically and angrily glaring at us like we were keeping her from something far more important. Seriously, we barely interacted with this woman other than to ask for a table and yet we were ducking the daggers shooting from her eyes all night. WTF was that all about? Look, any restaurant can have an off night maybe they were short handed in the kitchen or something. But to not acknowledge it all and generally avoid your patrons is not the tactic I would have run with.",1
Enjoyed our stay here on the 1st night of the road trip. After being on the road for as long as we were it was good to check in to a good sized suite that was clean and comfortable. There was a refrigerator and decent counter with sink in the living room area. Only issue was the bathroom was small in comparison. The nieces and their mom enjoyed the pool and whirlpool. I'd also booked the rest of the group to stay here on their return to SF I'd already flown home and they loved it even more because they were put into a larger suite with a full kitchen.,2
"Just went here for lunch. overall probably should get 3 stars, but the drinks and sticky toffee pudding helped it get over the hump. Main entr u00e9e was just ok, or C for the price. Would i go back? If I'm ever at Caesar's around lunch again, ill stop in and try something different.",2
"I love hot wings, and these ones are amazing if you like them tiny and overcooked. I'm beside myself with how awful the service was. The server dropped my large beer on top of another large beer, and the two glasses shattered, and beer and glass exploded all over us. It was a huge mess, we all got a beer glass shower, and my phone was completely submerged in a beer puddle. We had 11 people and kids, and had to clean up ourselves and the glass, which was everywhere. The staff didn't move us to a clean table or offer to put in our food order in a timely manner. When we finished and the server brought the check, he didn't offer anything a discount, free dessert, etc. I waited tables for years and it's nothing for a restaurant to give freebies and make customers happy so they'll come back again to make sure we didn't leave unhappy. I spoke to the manager, who seemed to care more about showing off her tattoo sleeves than happy customers. Ugh. I'd give this place negative stars if I could, for the sub quality food, awful service, the manager's inability to correct a bad situation we aren't impossible customers , and having to pull shards of glass out of everything while we ate. I can't wait to never go back here!",1
"Ben's BBQ catered our summer employee 1000 people picnic 2 weeks ago at Floyd Lamb State Park. We are still receiving compliments from the employees on our choice of food. n nWe had a menu of pulled pork sandwiches, chipotle lime cole slaw and peppered corn. For those with restricted diets or kids there were turkey hot dogs, veggie burgers and beef hot links. The pulled pork was simply delectable. It was tender and moist and had the perfect balance of smoke and flavor. The bread tasted fresh from the bakery and the sauces that accompanied the sandwiches were all equally gratifying. The spicy BBQ sauce had some serious kick! The cole slaw was outstanding, mixing chipotle flavor into a traditional southern staple was ingenious especially when added to the sandwich! The peppered corn was so tasty and seasoned people were coming back asking for seconds. They also served 300 pounds of the sweetest watermelon I've tasted since I left the south. n nThe staff were all attentive and genial. The guy who carved all of the watermelon in the 100 degree heat, did so with a smile on his face. The owner of the business needs his own TV show, he was so entertaining. He socialized, danced and interacted with the employees all while overseeing the food service. This truck served all 1000 of our employees in a few hours without ever having a line or a long wait. They exceeded our expectations in every aspect and I can't wait to use them again for our next big corporate event. In the meantime I might have to hit the streets to try that BBQ again!",2
"The food was excellent. Salsa had great flavor. It was a little hot for my son, so he mixed it with the mild tomatillo salsa. Cheese dip was great too! I had some kind of turkey carnitas taco on a whole wheat tortilla with bacon and avocado on it, DELICIOUS! Top shelf margarita was 10 tonight Thurs and well worth it! We will definitely go back! So nice it is just 3 miles from home too.",2
I took the advise of Lea B. and she was right Erica is the BEST! nI Live in Arizona and come to Nevada once a month Erica will be the only person who ever touches my hair again!,2
"The most hostile people I have ever met. Horrible in every respect, I am surprised people pay for the abuse they deliver. My experience with XS was hands down the worst I have ever had with any venue, ever. They ruined my birthday, embarrassed me, and I believe potentially charged me for it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!",1
"I love this restaurant ! Tis is the 3rd year in a row, my bf and I spent our anniversary, while at spring training. Every time has been really good! This time I chose the chicken which was so good and moist and garlicky! Yum! My bf had the salmon and he licked the plate clean. For our starter we did share the beef skewers, so good! Definitely will get those again! The drinks are great as well, I had a lychee martini, and the bf had a dirty martini.both delicious!",2
"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks. It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return.",1
"This place was pretty good. I'm happy that they had the three colors dessert here. Oh so good. It's not as sweet as other places that I've gotten it at. I ordered the BBQ Pk and shredded pork dish 42 and that was delicious. I tried some of their beef stew noodle dish and their egg noodle dish both which were also good. n nThe spring roll was interesting because it was mostly all veggie with shrimp and beef slices. I'm used to the spring rolls having some mi fun rice noodles in it, too, but it was good regardless. n nThe vietnamese coffee was also good. Very sweet, but good. I also like how cheap and clean this place is.",2
"I can't believe all the poor reviews. This is, after all, a fast food restaurant. I have been there 10 or 12 times and the employees have always been friendly. They have a decent selection of sides and the chicken is far better, and healthier, than any of the KFCs or Churches I have tried in the area. Always like picking up a to go order there when the grand kids are in town.",2
"I remember coming here when I was a little kid with my family, and the food was very good. Fast forward 20 years and I decided to take my family here. I looked at the reviews on yelp and everyone seemed to rave about the oxtail soup. n nWe arrived around 10 PM tonight, and met ""Maria "" our hostess. Man.she must of been having a bad day because she did not smile once when she greeted us, and seemed like she didn't want to be at work. Not a good first impression for customers. n nWell we finally get seated and the first thing she ask me is ""Are you ordering the prime rib? If you are you only have a few minutes. "" I told her I think I'm gonna get the oxtail soup. She tells me ""if you are gonna order the soup you have to go outside and wait back in line until 11p. "" I told her no that's fine, I'll order something else. n nShe storms off, and proceeds to mumble something to her fellow coworker. While waiting for our waiter.she keeps staring me down like I did something wrong. Again as she walks by my table she tells the waiter that I have to go back outside if I am ordering the soup. I'm thinking in my head.wow what did I do to piss her off. I've been nothing but polite to her and the rest of the staff. n n nWell we finally get our food and guess what.we find a black hair in my son's wonton soup. At this point I am furious because of all the smart remarks she told us, and the digusting hair in our soup. Fortunately the waiter did not charge us for the soup and one of the other entrees. n nSo unfortunately I did not get to try the oxtail soup, and have given 1 star for the rude service. I did file a complaint with the supervisor who was polite and had me write a statement, as ""Maria "" has been a problem before. n nMaybe next time I'll come back to try the oxtail soup when Maria no longer works there. By the way I have a weird feeling Maria put the black hair in our food but have no way of knowing. n n nI took a picture of maria as she is giving us the evil death stare.lol.",1
"I had severe Melasma dark brown hormonal spots all over my face from post pregnancies . I had tried everything with my dermatologist and learned that facial laser usually helped. I purchased 6 laser treatments and could hardly wait. After thousands of dollars and NO results, I can honestly say this place is useless. I was told they had to start the laser low to see how my skin would react. By the time we had the laser turned up to where it actually did anything, it was my last treatment! I feel like if they knew what they were doing we would have done a test spot or 1 treatment to test where the laser should be set at. My thought is that the last high level laser treatment got the results so they wanted me to buy more laser treatments to finish up the results. I went to the Arrowhead Nu U location and it has since closed go figure but I think they moved to another location, so don't waste your time with this place. Go to a dermatologist, get a good, trustworthy recommendation and stay away from this place.",1
"This place is a lot nicer than I expected it to be in an older gym. Its clean, and big. Still nicer than most 24 hour fitness in the Valley! ",2
"Wow! What an amazing place! Food is wonderful, but the real gem there is Kat. She works the bar and I can not begin to put into words how she has blessed my life with her kindness. She truly makes me excited to go back there. nThe food is amazing, but for a broke college student it can be a bit pricey. Way worth it thought! Splurge and pamper yourself with the great food! nI will continue to go back there!",2
"We got a few slices to go at NY Pizza Lovers. We tried the veggie, pepperoni, and a sausage combo. I have had frozen pizza better than the pizza here. I highly doubt I would return. I didn't give them one star because I only tried their pizzas it's possible something on the menu is worth eating just not the pizza.",1
"Oh Barrio. How I wanted to love your food. 1 app, 1 entree, 1 margarita 55.00. The guac was good niice addition of the Pom. The halibut veracruz was not seasoned well and the side of seasonal veggies was just half cook thick planks of zucchini. I like to try places Guy Fieri visits this was miss for me.",1
"The Awesome Standard Lees Selection, which is amazing. Don't be fooled into thinking this Lee's has a better selection than other comparably sized Lee's, they use their extra stock for pallets of clearance, none of which has seemed particularly appetizing. nThe Abysmal The service. The best case scenario is they ignore you. More often they will give you dirty looks, huddle in conversation when you're clearly looking for help despite looking your way, and occaisionally be outright hostile. nI had an older asian gentleman of who I gathered was the manager refuse to even investigate whether a sales price hadn't been updated on an item. He wouldn't even check. So I went and got the sale sign from the aisle and despite the aisle being full of the signs it was a large stock he insisted they were all wrong and refused to apologize. Some of the worst customer service I have ever had anywhere.",1
"I've been to this shop twice, the first time was just browsing and I found the staff very friendly and helpful. Today's visit was the exact opposite. I went to purchase some road cycling shoes. Since I've never owned any before I thought I'd go here and probably pay a little more but make sure I've got a good fit and a good shoe. I'm training for my first triathlon and told the guy that I wasn't sure if I wanted road shoes or tri shoes to go with my existing SPD pedals and cleats. He told me I'd have to swap my peddles if I wanted tri shoes, so I looked at some road shoes. I was trying to decide between two pairs when I thought I should at least look at learn a bit about tri shoes. I picked up a pair and the tag said ""SPD Compatible "". I asked the guy about this and he said that they didn't have my size. So he had lied to me about having to change pedals just because he wouldn't be able to sell me the shoes! What a jerk. I don't think I could shop there again. Albeit, I'm a newb to cycling but had they done a nice job, they'd have won a customer for life.",1
"I know, I know. I stopped at a place doing breakfast only because its in the airport. nOrdered the Mediterranean omelette, tried to get Monterey Jack instead of mozzarella was told it would be ok, but didn't happen. It was kind of like getting pizza toppings in an omelette, which could be good. But it was only ""eh "". Coffee was also terrible. Sadly this still seems like the best non Cinnabon option for breakfast in terminal d.",1
"What started off to be a nice experience quickly fizzled when an hour after leaving the theatre we realized we were given the wrong credit card. We had to go back to the theatre. My husband spoke to the manger and the senior manager about the issue. They were pleasant, apologized, took down his information so if the other girl comes back with our card they will call us. They also sent him off with a bunch of coupons for free appetizers bogo entrees and a few movie passes. That would have been a very kind gesture if they didn't EXPIRE on 10 15 2011 being that today is 10 9 2011. The few movie passes don't expire for a year which is nice. Those ""might "" make up for the time it takes for me to cancel my credit card, change my auto pays to a new card etc. n nTip for the Esplanade Please give your servers flashlights so they can give out the right credit card to the right customer. On a side note our friends that went with us were given the wrong change and had to let the server know or they would have been short changed n nWe will stick with Harkins at Fashion Square.",1
"Besides my waiter treating me like an idiot my experience was okay. possibly from the drinks? n nMe and my friends had 2 tasting menus, the cod, the dim sum sampler, and 3 hot and sour soups. n ntasting menu blah, the lobster sauce wasn't good at all though, the filet was cooked well, and the general tao was like it came from a mall food court. n nhot and sour soup pretty good. but i was starving and it was the first thing I ate all day n ndim sum sampler do not order. it's 3 little dumplings, maybe even frozen? n nthe cod was pretty good. but i've never had a bad miso cod. n noverall I wouldn't go again, a waste of money for what you get. i might as well have gone to panda express. the ambiance was nice though.",1
"This place is exactly as advertised, BBQ the way that it should be. The line moved super fast which was great because I was starving when I showed up. I expected decent BBQ when I showed up I didn't expect some of the best green beans I've ever had and the mustard greens, whoo! I've had some good BBQ in my day, the Salt Lick in Austin, Texas even which is some of the best BBQ in the country and I can say the BBQ at Can't Stop stacked up. The Tri Tip was so good with the spicy BBQ sauce it literally made me go cross eyed! If you want mouth watering BBQ check this place out, you won't be disappointed!",2

"This review is based on a selling experience I had just yesterday. I brought in name brand jeans, dresses, jackets, tops and shoes that were never worn most of the clothing wasn't worn either, or very gently used . I don't know who these ""buyers "" think they are, but they are extremely rude and picky to the point of why bother asking people to bring clothes in?! A brand new White House Black Market dress, never worn was turned away because, ""We have so many dresses already, we have to make a profit somehow. "" mind you on the phone they specifically asked for DRESSES Its surprising to see how they can make a profit, seeing that most everything in there is ugly, old, and sometimes smelly! To tout yourself as a ""high end boutique thrift store "" is quite frankly a misnomer and a joke. I'm sorry if I was not hip enough to sell there, but just down the street at Trend Traders I was.",1
"I believe that ""Weiss "" is German for white. How appropriate. The food couldn't get any more white, bland and tasteless. nI was really eager to try this place. The pictures looked great, the reviews were good, and I saw on the menu that they had cabbage soup, which I loved from Foxy's and from Jackie's in Commercial Center two late lamented delis which reveal how incredibly old I am. nSo, and equally decrepit friend and I grabbed our walkers and shuffled on down. nIt was busy, but we were seated quickly and service was efficient if not particularly friendly. So far, so good. nWe were disappointed that they didn't bring us a dish of pickles or a basket of rye bread, which were standard in the aforementioned old school spots, but then, nobody pumps your gas for you anymore, either, so still o.k. nI was trying to be conservative on calories so I had a 1 2 brisket on rye with cabbage soup, my friend went wild with a triple decker concoction involving corned beef, pastrami, and cole slaw. nFirst, we got the soup. I was expecting a rich, tangy, tomato base. This was more brown. You know how when you cook soup and store it overnight it's usually better the next day? Well, this was more like they had been reheating it and keeping it hot every day for about a week so it just tasted old. The accompanying hard toasted bagel slices were clearly a creative use of leftovers that would have been thrown away. I am a crostini fan so I liked them. My friend did not. nThen came the sandwiches. They looked good. Until I opened mine to add mustard. The brisket was mostly fat, and wet, soggy fat at that. Like catching a glimpse of myself getting out of the shower. Her pastrami and corned beef were almost tasteless. Again, I think they sliced the meat and held it in hot water repeatedly until they managed to leach out any semblance of flavor. nThe only thing they didn't soak were the pickles, which still tasted raw. After sampling those and the flavorless rye bread, I no longer yearned for the free samples. nI will say that the chicken noodle soup looked great, as did the breakfast ordered at another table. But ours LOOKED good, too. And what does it say about a menu where the standout is chicken soup? Bland, bland, bland.",1
"Often packed, often disappointing. No matter what they say the music is. it is ALWAYS house music and it's always bad. The food isn't horrible, though i wouldn't recommend the grilled cheese, it's way too much bread! The drinks are pricey, the food is pricey, the portions are alright. It's not a very interesting place to eat. And I would recommend going in the early afternoon evening before it gets packed with ravers.",1
"I only needed an oil change. Service techs used scare tactics to pressure oversell me service I didn't need. They will show you pictures of a dirty engine and warn you that you will breakdown if you ignore their recommendation. They were pressuring me to have a transmission flush and fill, although I showed them a receipt of that service being completed by Firestone a year before 10k miles prior . They recommended that I have the power steering flush fill which isn't required by the manufacturer. They were going to charge me 20 for an oil filter they didn't have in stock. I went to PepBoys and bought the filter I needed for 6. Also an incompetent tech forgot to place the transmission dipstick back into my vehicle. They made no apologies.",1
"Can't complain, 4.99 for a breakfast buffet. I feel like I'm back in the 80's, yes I'm that old. I remember breakfast buffets that cheap. Food was mediocre, c'mon it's a buffet, what do you expect. I'm not a buffet person, but for 5 why not. Good thing is that a mimosa was only 3, score",1
Love their brunch menu and awesome baked goods! The icing on their cupcakes are to die for! Very cute little cafe on Butler street.,2
"Nothing authentic about this place. Some of the blandest Mexican food I've ever had. Mild salsa tastes like tomato paste, fajitas were more like stir fry, chimichanga just had shredded chicken with no spices or flavor, but guacamole was good.",1
"First off, I must say that this review is specifically for this particular Yardhouse. I also want to add that I am a big fan of Yardhouse in Town Square but definitely not this one! I am writing this review after the third visit and third strike against this place. Drove all the way across town to meet some friends and showed up at 5pm for Happy Hour. At this time, we were told that it would be a 15 20 min wait. One hour later we were very frustrated and still waiting to get a table! We had a 2 y o with us which made the wait even worse. I have never been to a restaurant in town at 5pm and had to wait an hr to get a table and I feel this is unacceptable at this time especially when there are tables sitting empty inside! They finally call our name and we are seated. Our waitress comes up and we immediately see that she is a scatterbrain says a quick hello and apologizes saying she will be right back? Ask to see a manager immediately to see if we can do anything about missing happy hr. Manager comes over and is a decent enough guy who says any drinks and appetizers will be at happy hr pricing but doesn't have a reason why it took an hr to be seated? Order drinks and it literally took 3 tries with our waitress to get our drink order right. When she finally did, it took another 20 mins to get a pint of beer? This continued through our meal and needless to say, we were all upset and unimpressed! The food all arrived cold and unappealling as well. This very poor service waitstaff has been experienced all three times at this location and I will not be coming back. The friends we were with go there about 3 times a week and also said they will not be returning here. Loser here in my book that needs to really get their act together!",1
"They are fast and do quality work for a pretty good price. They took out 5 bushes replaced part of my irrigation and sprinkler system, mowed and fertilized my yard all in less than 2 hours. Very nice guys!",2
Eh. I've had better.,1
"Loved this place and spent way too much money here. The best thing about Kabuki is the Happy Hour pricing. Selected items are 30 to 50 off. You'll get decent sushi for decent prices, considering you're in Vegas. n nAs another reviewer noted, the tables seem to shrink rapidly. They will bring out a dish for everything you order and it gets crowded fast.",2
"EH! n nSort of expensive for what you get. I understand that you might pay a little more to hang out and chill there. but still. at 6 bucks for a medium with boba. overpriced! n nThe service is awkward at least late night . They kind of hover over you until you decide what to order. Then, you never see them again. I even had to go to the counter to get my order even though we were seated confused they took our order at the table, but I had to get up for my drink? n nAnyway, I normally get the smoothie type of drink with boba. Taro's my fav. Blech! I could taste the powder. and it was way too icy chunky tasting. We also go the Red Bean expecting it to taste like Red Bean ice cream . Tasted like straight up beans. n nAnyway, I see the appeal of the place as a hang out joint. but I'll be sticking to Volcano Tea House just a minute away.",1
"We had breakfast here on Saturday and the burritos were good but the service was horrible. My husband and in laws ordered coffee and were told it was out and would be about 10 minutes. Ok. We waited quite a while for our food and were half way through when my husband went up for the 3rd time to ask about the coffee. Was told it would be another 30 minutes. When he asked for a refund, the lady rolled her eyes at him and said he had to wait in line. It wasn't a huge amount but to wait 30 minutes for coffee? This was my 3rd time to this location and the service hasn't been great any of the times. I don't think we'll be going back.",1
"Just so so. We saw this show on 5 23 14. Had loveseat tickets that we paid a premium for, but they were to the left of the stage and near the back. Saw NOTHING going on at the back of the stage. When the show started, they forgot their mics, so we had no idea what was happening for the first 15 minutes.the music was loud but good. The acts weren't that impressive, other than the contortionist and the little man flying through the air. They could have kept the two fat girls. Added nothing to the show. And the black girl only had African dancing skills? The audience participation was cute, but any of it that happened at the beginning was lost on us. If you get comped, take it. Otherwise, save your money. A drink was 13! Absinthe at Caesars was a better show.",1
"I usually buy all of my booze at Total Wine or BevMo. However, having read the reviews here, and wanting to support local businesses, I made the drive up to Tempe to check out Tops. n nIs this the unfriendliest place in town? I think it has to be right up there. The guy at the register acted like he was doing me a big favor ringing up my not so well priced bottle of single malt scotch. I hate that. n nThe overall selection is certainly good, but not as good as Total Wine, in my opinion. That said, they do have a tremendous variety of scotch and Irish whiskey. They have bottles stuck here and there all over the place. It sort of becomes like a treasure hunt to find all of the places they have stuffed the odd bottle. That was kind of fun. They also have a few I have never heard of, which is pretty cool. n nBut I can't get over the awful service. Others here have had better luck, so maybe I'll give it another try in the future, but not for awhile. It seems like the place has built a reputation, and is now resting on its laurels.",1
"I don't know how other reviewers compare Trams to Pho Minh. Pho Minh is disgusting and uses a very tasteless powder broth soup base for their pho. Pho Minh is a lot closer to the real deal, but their pho selection is really small. n nThis has been the best bowl of pho I've had in Pittsburgh, and the four stars is totally relative for the 'burgh.",2

I agree this place kind of sucks. Food is average. and although it looks really nice no one ever seems to be there. It is always dead. they have great TV's and I think the place should hop but instead it is not. n nGo to tanked fish next door. everyone else does. This place looks really good and I like the bar set up. reason for 2 stars.,1
"I'm not really a fan of fancy French pastries. They look pretty but they don't taste all that great. Luckily Amelie's has other offerings that keep me interested and coming back for more! n nOne favorite is the breakfast sandwich. I order mine with spinach, egg whites, and mozzarella on a baguette. It is lightly toasted and the cheese is melted perfectly. It is 4.89 and 75 cents extra to sub egg whites for the whole egg. It's so good I don't care and sometimes I am guilty of ordering two! n nAfter I'm done eating probably a day's worth of calories on 2 breakfast sandwiches, sometimes I feel like eating something ""healthy. "" Lynn's salad is tiny and pricey but it's amazing! It's made up of mixed greens, mandarin oranges, strawberries, feta, and candied almonds but the thick, gooey, brown crap that it comes with makes it crave worthy! It is called celery seed vinaigrette but it doesn't look much like a vinaigrette. It's sweet and tangy and I always have to get extra because one little cup just isn't enough! If I happen to have any leftover then I just eat the rest of it by the spoonful and if it wasn't looked down on then I would just lick that cup clean. Ah who am I kidding I've already done that! n nListen to the majority and get the salted caramel brownie! Dense, rich brownie on the bottom and a layer of toffee flavored caramel on top. Mmmm. Also the lemon raspberry tart is delish! n nMinus one star because it's expensive for the tiny portions but man oh man. The flavors are on point!",2
"I'm not sure what I'm missing here, but I didn't care for this place. It had a funny ""used oil "" smell. The sushi was just ok, but I could never get over the oily smell of the place. I ordered the Chirashi dinner. The sashimi was served on top of the hot rice, in effect cooking it. When I asked, she said the cook was new. nI'll never come here again, there are other places better in Ahwatukee.",1
"Doesn't matter what time of the day it is, there is always a line. Not because they are busy, but because they have no sense of urgency. Once you are able to order, it takes about 10 15 mins to get your food and when you do get it, they often forget a side part like salsa with a wrap, or yogurt with fruit. I've given them several chances as I do enjoy the food, but the wait and lack of respect from employees that you are appreciated for being there just never improves. I'll go to a place that cares about my business.",1
"If you're planning on using the drive thru, be sure to check your order before you leave. It's almost a guarantee that they'll forget to put something in there. It's annoying. Screw up once out of maybe 10 or 20 times, you're human. Screw up my order five times in a row, you obviously don't give a rodent's derriere about your job. I would think neither does your manager about his. I eventually stopped going to this place and went to the remodeled one on 75th and Encanto. n nThey're ""open 24 hours "" but may as well be closed. I went there for a burger and baked potato around 2 a.m. and first asked for the baked potato. ""We stop serving those and chili after 10. "" ""Can I get a Baconator Single? "" ""We stop serving meat after 1. "" ""Then, WHAT DO YOU HAVE? "" ""We have chicken.um. "" ""Never mind, then. "" n n Drives off in an late night, unending hunt for food ",1
"Terrible prices don't waste the drive, and when you comment on there Facebook page they delete it instead of answering me they deleted it. All they did was mess it up for people who grow by there, now there forced to pay high prices just like the pharmaceutical companys make .

Great breakfast place ! I had the eggs Benedict and they were delicious . Service was excellent ! Looking forward to going back .,2
"The closest to Roscoe's that I've ever found. Yes, Roscoe's is better but NOT BY MUCH. I think the waffles were a tad bit sweeter than Roscoe's perhaps a bit too sweet for me? , but overall the combination is perfection! This will be very high on my list for my return visits to Phoenix. It's relatively close to the airport and worth the drive if you are on a layover. YUM. n nAs a side note, the beverage menu is pretty freaking hilarious as well. They serve HUGE jars of kool aid and I saw many people getting REFILLS of their 60 ounce kool aid . I guess the only thing better than a 2000 calorie breakfast is another 2000 calories of bright red artificial awesomeness to wash it down with ",2
"Bestow my heart! Found out about this bakery at the farmers market Phoenix Public Market .was so excited they were located only minutes from me in the west valley. n nMom and Pop came out from the bakery behind the counter to greet me.I wanted just bagels by the way she gives you a bakers dozen but I walked out with cinnamon popovers and a monkey bread loaf she modestly calls a white bread. n nThe loaf is amazing. Looks like a pull apart bread lightly crusty on the outside and light, fluffy deliciousness inside. It's so big it pops up high, right over the pan. I didn't even need butter.be careful though, this bread can be addictive and it's hard to put down! She has a jalape u00f1o and a garlic variety, which I can tell you are crazy delicious. n nI've had the cinnamon popovers which are to die for, and today she had chocolate chip popovers.which I passed on. n nI was close to wiping her out of bagels.she has plain, everything, salt, garlic, poppy, sesame and a couple of others. Mom tells me she doesn't use preservatives, so everything is fresh and goes fast.come early. n nThe bagels are this close to tasting like a NY bagel and they freeze really well. Slight baked crunch on the outside, light and airy on the inside. n nMom and pop sells Boarshead meats sandwiches and has a few other items on a short menu. She also had phyllo triangles stuffed with spinach and cheese along with other bakery items. n nThe restaurant area is cute and small, set up with a few tables and a soda machine refill station. Tucked in the back of a strip mall right off the 101 and Union Hills, a little hard to find the first time, but your radar will be on once you're ready to go back.",2
"The place has a wonderful selection of cheeses as well as things to go with them bread, crackers, ect. The best thing is the wonderful staff. Everyone is so helpful and knowledgeable about everything in the store.",2
"So the last couple times I've been to Carlsbad I've been disappointed. This place has really lost its luster. The salsa now tastes like it comes straight from a can and there was such a huge layer of grease on my food that I couldn't figure out where my enchiladas stopped and the beans started. Last night I went there with my mom and Grandma and the waitress was a huge snob, we didn't even want to tip her of course we did . It was so dark in the dining room that my grandma couldn't see the menu so she asked if they had a shredded beef burro. The waitress, in a condescending voice says, ""Yes, of course we do, what you want is a green chili burro "". Gma then asked if that was spicy and she said, ""Not really "". It came out so spicy that she couldn't even eat it. The waitress did not offer to make her something else or take if off the bill, she was sooooo rude the entire meal, I won't even write about all the instances. Her name was Michelle, so if you go there and she's your server you may as well get up and leave. I really want to like Carlsbad, its within walking distance from my house and has a good concept. I just don't know if I can go back after my experience last night.",1
"I have to say the table side guac is some of the best I've had. Almost as good as Rick Bayless' guac, but still can't touch my mom's. nWe went for their Sunday brunch menu and were very pleased with the options. We had a hard time choosing what to eat! They do an all you can eat street tacos with pork on Sunday as well. we opted for the recommended Chaquiles with pork in the red sauce and it was incredible! And some other scramble with vegetables. nThey have a great patio in the back of the restaurant with a lion fountainhead and just the right amount of sun peaking through the umbrellas they have up. The drink options are great as well I hope to go back and eat another meal at this restaurant!",2
"This place is awesome IF you have table which they start at 9000.00. I've gone in a couple of times with reservations and it's no problem to get in, but then I've also gone other times with out a table and it has been hell! If you are willing to wait then you are looking at an approximate wait time of an hour to two hours unless you have a couple of hot, thin, caucasian females with you then you might get in earlier. You could bribe the bouncer and get in quicker so unethical! I like how classy and fancy this place is, that is why I go, but if I have to wait you better believe I much rather go to Mint. Oh another thing, their drinks start at 10.00. I've seen discrimination towards minorities occur at this location. Very pathetic! I hope this place goes out of business soon. Although with all those bribes and the ridiculous amount of money they charge for things they might just manage to stay open longer. Don't go unless you have a table or are willing to waiting all night long .",1
"I hated food in terminal 3.that is, until I gave Paradise a shot. n nThe staff were incredibly friendly the sandwich maker even created my California turkey exactly as I requested pesto mayo and ranch on the side, with extra veggies. n nThe bread was incredibly fresh and the veggies were crisp. The turkey was so so.nothing special. The pesto mayo made the sandwich. Plus, it came with a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. n nA great place for a quick, healthy bite before a flight.",2
"Wow. Horrible fucking service and not so great food. We made a reservation for 6 at 730pm and got there at 8. As soon as we walked in, we were seated right away. After that, it all went downhill. It took 10 min for them to ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered a round of waters and she told us the waiter would bring us water and she got upset cause no one ordered alcohol. 20 minutes pass by and finally the waiter comes to bring us water. So that's 30 min to get some fucking water. To top it off, my water came in a dirty glass and when I asked for a new one, the waiter said they ran out of cups. Umm hello? Fucking wash one. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and when it came out, for sure that shit came out of the freezer. It tasted really fishy. Next, the salad comes out and the dressing tasted so nasty. not one of us ate the salad. we had to ask 3 times for them to start serving the meat and after another long 30 minute wait, the meat finally comes. i was so hoping for the meat to be tender and well seasoned but that backfired as well. the only thing that i can say was good was the chicken. after 1 full round of all the meats, the waiter kept asking us if we were done. i guess it was his time to go home. what the fuck man. at this point we were all fed up already and just wanted to leave so we ask for our check. ANOTHER 30 min pass by and finally i got tired of all this bullshit and got up to ask for the check. the polite waiter who i give my 1 star to told us that ever since the manager that was wearing a wig took over, the restaurant started going to shit. the pos system that they used was broken so they had to manually write down everyones order. he apologiezed to everyone and gave us 15 off coupons for future use. i will NEVER go back to this bullshit ass restaurant.",1
"I know Hooters isn't exactly fine dining but the service is always so friendly and nice that it deserves a good review. This is where we go for wings and a beer, they are good. We aways get the regular hot wings, the medium sauce is more like margarine or something. Sometimes the boneless wings are dry. nWe bring our kid with us and the girls always stop to say hi to her and give her a balloon. nLove the service, always great.",2
"Not impressed, I went here for breakfast brunch.I was truly disappointed! n n we were shuffled outside to the patio. Dishes were unclean with dust all over. n the price for the quality of food is not worth it. n service is ehhh. n if you arent looking for good food and only want an overpriced mimosa then this is the place for you. n bread pudding is savory, ours came out ice cold. n i have nothing more to say. n maybe they are better for dinner?",1
"I liked it! We went for lunch I got the pulled pork baked potato and a salad, hit the spot. The biscuits they start you off with are sinful and just plain mean if you are trying to eat healthy!",2
"Just getting around to writing a review for this great spot. The view is spectacular from the patio we always get patio seating here and a great place to just sit and people watch. n nMy husband and I dined here for about 3 hours just ""noshing "" on several different appetizers plus drinks. This is a great way to spend the afternoon and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and delicious. We both had the soup du jour which was LOBSTER BISQUE. It was truly wonderful but we ordered a shot of sherry for the soup, which to our disappointment should have been in the soup to begin with. Not a big deal since everything else was over the top. n nWe went back for dinner and sat on the patio again. And again, the food was memorable as was the ambience. n nMore recently 2 of my friends and I had lunch here and we all loved it so much we've decided to make this our favorite lunch spot. n nOne ordered the LEMON THYME SALMON. She said it was the best salmon she'd ever had and I had to agree. It was just a bit rare in the center which is what it's supposed to be and the lemon thyme flavor shone through. n nThe other One ordered a steak, done medium rare and she said it was perfect. I didn't taste the steak but she loved it. n nI ordered one of my favorite dishes TROUT GRENOBLAISE. Wow. It was absolutely fabulous. The sides we ordered were shared and there wasn't a thing we could find to complain about here. n nService was a little on the slow side but it was crowded and we were in no hurry. If you want patio seating next to the railing you need to get there just before they open so you can be seated among the first. It's worth it just to sit and watch the fountains and the throngs of people walking by. Take your time here.",2
"I've been here quite a few times. I gave this place a chance, I really did. 6 visits. It seems like a diamond in the rough and that it would of become my new favorite Thai spot, but there are many reasons that this place is lacking, and is best avoided. n nThe first impression of this place was good, it had nice decor and seemed like a very good menu. The Pad Thai is the only good thing I've ever tried here though, the curry is too watery, the tofu too over fried, and there's more onions than anything in the vegetable dishes. One time our rice was even burnt to crunchiness, ew. n nWhile that put me off in all of itself, the tipping edge of never returning here is the rude server we seem to always get. Most of the waitresses are nice, but there's always this one waitress maybe waiter, she sounds like a man that is rude as all hell when we visited here. She's not friendly to the customers, and slams food and glasses around. Like shit dude, if you don't like your job go get another one and quit making everyone else miserable. n nWhile I'll miss the Pad Thai, I'll be finding another Thai spot to replace this horrible restaurant.",1
"So far this is my favorite place for chicken. We've gotten their 18.95 whole chicken combo a few times now, and haven't been disappointed yet. We'll pick one up for carry out, and every one is still moist and delicious by the time we get home. The plantains are pretty tasty and their beans have a special place in my heart. I'm not normally a big fan of that style of bean, but these just rock my socks. Their sauces are what really set them appart though. They have three different sauces all at different heat levels, but each also has it's own unique flavor. My favorite is the light green one, but all three are great, and I don't find them to be too hot. n nThe combo will feed us both for a couple days, or we'll use the chicken in a recipe. At that price it's pretty hard to beat. I'm pretty sure Viva will remain our go to place for that lazy night when we just can't decide what to make or get.",2
"There are two Avis' with the same address on Yelp. hate when that happens. regardless. n nScenario goes down like this n n3 hours before we need to be at the airport, the Boyfriend checks out our Itinerary to Las Vegas complete with different companies rental car we booked months ago and decides that the reviews are horrendous enough for us to cancel said reservation. In retrospect, it would have been a headache! We re book with Avis for a standard car and head to the airport. n nAvis was great and got us into a car immediately, the whole landing without checked luggage, and renting a car with a reservation took like 40 mins tops.

"For our 13th anniversary, my wife and I decided to try this relatively new Northern Italian restaurant in Charlotte's Eastover neighborhood. The meal was terrific, particularly the fried Risotto Balls that started things off, and the INCREDIBLE Gnocchi that followed. Both paired perfectly with a wonderful bottle of Barolo from their extensive selection of Italian wines. n nI was a bit disappointed, though, with the Grouper we ordered for our main course. It came highly recommended by our server, but I found it to be a bit dry and lacking in flavor. I would not order it again. For dessert, we shared a fantastic plate of zeppoli, along with a pair of cannolis that were decent, but unfortunately underwhelming. For the price, I expected more. n nI wanted to like this restaurant more than I did, but considering they've only been open a few months, I'm hopeful the menu selections will improve by our next visit. There are better restaurants in Charlotte for the money, but Stagioni is a welcome addition to the local dining scene, and one that I hope will be around for many years to come!",2
"The room was expensive, especially considering the summer rates. The waterpark experience was disappointing. We couldn't bring in juice for our kids. Only water bottles. When my wife and I decided to get a cocktail it was 20 for two and there was no trace of any alcohol. I asked the bartender if I got a non alcoholic drink by mistake. It's all regulated so you get 1 oz in a tall drink. For 10 a drink I felt taken advantage. The closing time on Saturday is 4pm. They tell you that you have full access to the waterpark on check in day but check in time is 4pm. How does that work? For the cost of the room and drink service we should have stayed at a 5 star resort. We have stayed here before and had a better experience. This will be the last time for this resort. The Hilton Squaw Peak is a much better option.",1
"So where to begin? nMy boyfriend had been to this place several times and said it was pretty good. They only serve breakfast until 11am, so a lot of the time on his days off and late nights we woke up well after this gotta love vegas n nWe visited this establishment 8 17 2011 around 10am. We entered through the back door, the side where the salvation army is.Plenty of booths and tables open, we waited to be sat. There were two people working ,and the place wasn't crazy busy being it was a Wednesday. An older African American man and a younger African American woman with a ""four leaf clover on her neck "". The gentleman sat us and took our drink order. We waited about 5 mins after that to place our order. In this time around 5 Asian people came in and sat in the back corner, an African American older gentleman sat at the table behind my boyfriend alone and an older African American couple sat two booths back. no problems thus far. The woman came over and didn't even look at either of us while she took our order. She seemed like she was irritated. At the time i didn't think anything of it. I ordered turkey sausage and eggs he ordered hot links and eggs. Simple right? nSo the 5 Asian people get their food, then the gentleman alone gets his food, then the older couple gets their food. AND WE STILL HAVE NO FOOD ON THE TABLE! ITS 10 45! Not once did anyone stop by the table and let us know if we ordered something they were out of or that our food would be out shortly. n My boyfriend is African American and i am mixed black and white n I have tan skin and light hair so most people don't know im mixed. nI tell my boyfriend that i feel we are being discriminated against, And that i have experienced this before with my parents when i was younger. I wondered why the waitress didn't even look at us! You work for tips don't you? Arent you supposed to be nice and accommodating to your customers?!?!?! Its a shame that you couldn't provide proper service because you didn't appreciate the fact i was with a African American man. I could understand if one table got their food before us. But a party of 5 at one table, a party of one, and a party of two. THAT'S 8 PEOPLE THAT PLACED THEIR ORDER AFTER US! AND WE ONLY ORDERED EGGS AND SAUSAGE! THAT DOESN'T TAKE 45 MINS! nI tell my boyfriend that i am DISGUSTED and i will not be eating anything from this place. He says he wants to ask the waitress whats going on. At this time i walk out of the place and he stays behind trying to find out whats going on. nI am in tears in the car, stomach in knots in disbelief that its almost 2012 and things like this still go on. I now appreciate my African American father and Italian Greek mother even more for the things they had to go through to be together! I never realized the society we were living in. n I will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau today. And contacting the news to let them know about this. I had a good mind to stand on the sidewalk with a sign saying ""IF YOU ARE AN INTER RACIAL COUPLE YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T WELCOME HERE! "" n nI HOPE THE OWNER READS THIS AND TAKES MY COMPLAINT TO HEART. ""4 LEAF CLOVER LADY AS WELL "" REVERSE RACISM IS NOT RIGHT",1
"Update n nI don't mind 8.5 for wings as that is about average for a dozen wings. But when I get them and there are only 6, I'm never coming back to your restaurant. 17 for a dozen buffalo wings? HA! What the hell are you guys thinking?",1
Wonderful selection of very cold craft beer!,2
"Eh.Bravi Tuscan Kitchen is the italian version of paradise bakery. Weird menu combo's, awkward ordering counter, then so service once your food is delievered. n nI went to Bravi craving Panini and a glass of Pinot Noir without the expense of Postino.we should have just made the drive. 38 bought a pizza, a Panini w side salad and 2 glasses of nasty grocery store wine. Not understanding the deal with service I walked away after giving a normal tip 50 poorer for a meal we could have bought in the food court. n nNot only that but the place was filthy, granted busy friday night.but none of the 15 high school students standing behind the counter bothered to clear any of the empty tables.bused tables outside were covered in leftover spagetti goo.and to top it all off a chubby 9 year old stared at me the ENTIRE TIME I ATE and I dont think her parents even noticed! n nMaybe ok for lunch.dont be expecting anything special!",1
Food was so damn good make you wanna slap your mama! Lol nI got food for the family and the burgers are good my daughter loved her cheese fries and the hot dogs were amazing and the burrito was smaller than filibertos but so much more better as far as taste. My only complaint would be about the quesdilla they were small and definitely not worth the money buy overall a 5 and will be a repeat customer,2
"kind of random for a mexican restaurant to be at the venetian.its definitely unexpected but a very nice surprise. i love that its right on the canal because you get to people watch and listen to the people singing on those boat rides. we were seated right away, our server was nice he forgot to bring out water though, food was good, a bit more on the pricey side but expected. i ordered the pork tenderloin very juicy and seasoned well. my friend ordered the ahi tuna it was tasty but a bit on the salty side, she couldn't even finish it. we ordered the lobster and calamari cocktail and some chips and salsa for appetizers.both were really yummy. a pitcher of the pineapple infuzion margaritas were also ordered.they were really good. it provided a nice buzz as we left to go watch mystere. P good experience over all. i would definitely come back.ooh and they have happy hour!",2
Cox Communications nHORRIBLE customer service and OUTRAGEOUS prices.I am so so upset over the way they treat customers. They act like they own you and as if they are doing you the favor.what happened to quality customer service?,1
"It's pretty hard to screw up Mexican food, right? This place manages to do it quite well. I recently went there with a large group 8 of us to celebrate a birthday, and I was embarassed that I was the one who recommended it. I had never been to the one in DC Ranch, but had walked past it at night and it looked like a lively joint, so I chose this one because of the central location. n nWhere do I begin? The club soda in both my cocktails was flat, I ordered lemons and got a lime, and the chips were the absolute worst I have ever tried.like tasteless pieces of cardboard no lie. It was the first time I can remember not gorging on chips and salsa before the main meal. The salsa might have been OK if I'd been able to get one of the nasty chips in the thimble size bowl. I just gave up! My chicken quesadilla looked like they had warmed it up in a oven, the tortilla wasn't browned, the edges were dry, and it was just plain boring. We all ordered different dishes and not one of us was happy with our meal. n nOn the positive side, the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere is kind of fun if you're into rusty signs and plastic fish hanging from the ceiling, They also have a large patio that was well misted and at some point they had a singer guitar player performing. It was a relief from the horrendous soundtrack of classic rock from the 70's that was annoying me all through dinner. I was a teenager when those songs were current, but seriously, who wants to listen to The Who sing ""5 15 "" in a bar in 2008? n nUnless you just want to hang out on the patio and drink a cerveza, I wouldn't bother with this place. There are too many other great Mexican restaurants in town.",1
"My experience has been awful! I had to come here because of treatment in progress and the other office unexpectedly closed. The offices communication is not great. They made me wait for an appoint and then I sat for hours because they could not get my information from the office that closed. The final topper is they sent me to collections due to discrepancy between prior dentist payments and theirs. I tried to call and resolve once I saw they destroyed my perfect credit, but they still wouldn't remove. Beware they will ruin your life and your credit!",1
"There needs to be a minus button! This review will get edited with more details! We had an appointment! Ya'll, don't bother to set an appointment, I wouldn't even go to this shady place! Just to give you a quick idea, Pep Boys quoted us 1300.00 Said the rotors were bad! Hubby took the car to Mr. Breaks and only the rear break pads needed to be replaced! The price. 250.00! Pep Boys you should be ashamed of yourself! I thought you were a company that could be trusted! nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE UNLESS YOUR JUST GETTING A OIL CHANGE!",1
"Holy butter batman. Everything was rich and awesome. Cream and butter ruled the meal. Classic, well prepared and super enjoyable. We'll be back for sure.",2
"I have been going to this restaurant since I was a child, and it only gets better! Carolina's is definitely not known for the 5 star accommodations it provides. Rather people come here again and again, simply because it is INCREDIBLE food. The tortillas especially are to die for. One of the best tortillas I have ever had La Purisima has good ones as well . I ahve never had a bad meal at Carolinas! The prices don t hurt your wallet either!",2
Ugh. Our pho looks like the broth was scooped off the top layer because it was filled with fat. The service was just as bad they kept bringing out the wrong food and drinks. There was a female server there that didn't even speak a word and kept bringing out food and placing it at one end of the table and walking off without trying to figure out who it belonged to our telling us what it was. One pho dish we asked for them to cook their normally rare meat all the way before serving it as the person was pregnant and couldn't risk eating anything remotely raw but it still came out with half of the meat cooked and the other half raw. I definitely would not come here again.,1
This is one of the worst place I been too I can't believe a manager at Fashion Show Mall Karen Mesa she was not willing to give any solution on a wallet that I spent over 400.00 dollars. When the thread is coming out! She was the worst manager for a high end retail company.,1
"This hotel is what I like to call low brow high brow. What that means is that it's trying to be act high brow Caesarstone counters, white down comforters with no duvet covers ? , fridge and microwave in room this was the Loft room , nice big windows and engineered wood floors, Philosophy brand little products .but really it's low brow, for the following reasons n n It has an ""eco "" note to leave towels on floor that need to be washed but it's not eco at all. It expects that you take room service with sheet and towel changing every SINGLE day, when it is not necessary. In other hotels I've stayed in, there is a door hanger like the Do Not Disturb that enables you to refuse room service to save your sheets and towels to conserve water, electricity, and gas or a notepad where you can indicate this. Here, no. In fact, we got printed notes on our door wasted time and paper to let us know that they couldn't clean because the only option they left us was the Do Not Disturb sign . And then we got a call. Not only is this NOT eco it's annoying. n n The concierges are terrible for knowledge, advice, service, etc. One example is when we were locked out of our room at 2 a.m. because of an electronic failure with the door key. Really?! Really! Our concierge had to try like 100 keys to open our room with a key and then only use that key to get us in and out until the electronic box was reprogrammed. And no apologies or freebies for that. Another reviewer mentions getting late checkout for free just for asking all we asked was for was being able to leave our packed suitcases in the room so I could change into pants later in privacy and to leave water in our fridge so it would be cold. We were told this would be 50, even though we'd have been out at 2 30 and there was plenty of time to clean the room. Every single concierge I needed assistance and advice from steered me wrong, particularly on food. n n TERRIBLE food! Insultingly bad continental ""free "" breakfast bad coffee, horrible pastries, yogurt. Nothing but sugar and carbs and nothing resembling decent French baked goods. We couldn't stomach it, so we were thankful we could buy less sugary yogurt, etc. and use our fridge. n n TERRIBLE neighborhood. Got harassed by the same street addicts daily, and we watched many drug deals from our room window. n n When we pulled down the shades on roller chains they rolled right off! n n NOISE NOISE NOISE. No insulation, traveling sound so much it sounds like people are IN your room with you. Could hear running water urine sounds from next door. n nSo there you go. Totes low brow place that attempts to mask this with some ""high brow "" associated features. n nI'd be hard pressed to want to stay here again.",1
"Just got off the plane and wanted to get some beer and snacks at Ranch 99 market so we decided to get a quick bite to eat next door at Beijing Garden. It was 2 30 and all the other restaurants were closed. I had been there before when it as another Chinese restaurant. The decor was the same. The menu was colorful and extensive. nWe were the only ones in the place from beginning to end of the meal. We ordered two dishes the rice noodle soup and the house special crispy fried noodles. The Crispy Noodles had chicken, pork and shrimp and was OK 3 stars. The other rice noodle soup was terrible. A little ground pork in a bland greasy pork broth and some thin rice noodles. no stars. see pics. It comes spicy and they way it's spiced is the waiter gives you some siracha to add. The people who work there didn't know their own dishes. Sorry but, I don't think I will be coming back. Also, they turned a nicely decorated restaurant and added some stainless steel hot food tables in the back. It makes the place look like a cheap street food stand in the back of a Hutong open air market in Beijing.",1
"The meh isn't a knock on Big Elvis, but, rather, a knock on the venue. Buffalo Bill's Gamblin Hall didn't have the decency to inform anyone that a stand in was performing when we went. The stand in was OK, but was pretty disappointing to sit through what seemed to us to be a warm up act only to realize after about four songs that the act we came to see would not be performing. It's a small room, and we didn't want to be rude, so we sat through the entire hour show. n nTip Before you sit down, confirm that Big Elvis is actually performing.",1
"Although breakfast stops at 2PM, I couldn't be too upset because well. We waited until 2 30 to eventually get somewhere for breakfast. That's totally on us. My girlfriend was a bit upset, but I had to remind her. Seriously. We didn't get somewhere for BREAKFAST by past lunch time haha n nI've been wanting to try this place for awhile since we just moved into the very near neighborhood, and it has some pretty good reviews. It being near the lakes, being called a lounge, and open 24 hours. I imagined some sort of diner type place. Well, I was mistaken. n nFirst of all, on the outside, it's nothing special to look it. Honestly if I wasn't navigating there from Yelp, I might have just not seen it. My girlfriend and I were a little hesitant, but I figured hey, it's got good reviews and I've never let a dive type place stop me from enjoying food! See The Waffle House . n nWe swing the door open to the dining side of the place, and wow! Much different than imagined. As noted by others, very dark, but it was nice. You can see the pictures, nice stone walls, all the furniture looked new, just an overall cozy nice atmosphere. I would have preferred a window, but seeing as how there was a glass wall between the bar and gambling area, I'm sure they were looking to keep the whole place dark at all times. n nWe grabbed the menu, swam in some self pity about the breakfast situation, and then ordered some lunch. I got the lakes cordon bleu, and man, was that sandwich good. It was under 8 bucks, and came with plenty of sweet potato tots which were really sweet potato y! n nI mean, drenching it in buffalo wing sauce was just a beautiful touch, and the frying on the chicken was perfect. Seriously, I'm salivating right now imagining having it again. It was just that well done. n nWe also got some coffee that was pretty good too. n nOne big reason we will be back, the value of this place is nuts! I saw fettuccine Alfredo on the menu, and read 10.99. I was thinking wow that's incredibly cheap. Then saw that was for added chicken! The normal one is 7.99! Definitely going here for a super affordable dinner in the very near future.",2
"I am a resident of DTLV and really wanted to love this place. My friends and I ate there last night and this is a recap of the good, the bad, and the angry n n The bacon jam was great n The brownie dessert and donut bread pudding were fantastic! n The Turkey burger was good but not enough ""slaw "" n n The cauliflower was far too salty to even stomach n The sliders were dry but are on the right path n n They charged us for a steak that they had informed us they were out of and forgot to take it off the bill. They clearly do NOT know how to work their POS and charged my card 4 times for the same meal and so my 65 meal has now cost me 275, a call to the manager, and fraud reports to my bank. Unacceptable. n nAll in all we ordered the following n nWellington Empanada n ""Devils "" Eggs nJerk Turkey Burger nRainbow cauliflower nShort Rib Sliders nGlazed Donut bread pudding nBurboun fudge brownie with brown butter bacon ice cream n nThe only way I will return is if I am just getting drinks dessert and I pay cash.",1
"My husband and I ate there on Nov 6, I was disappointed having heard so many things about Metro Pizza. Our waitress was very nice and answered all of our questions. I orderd a small pizza my husband a shrimp pasta dish. My pizza was served to me 15 minutes before my husband was served. The pizza was good but limp, the cheese could have used more time in the oven. The pasta sauce on my husbands dinner was extremely spicy! almost to the point of unearable. nThe managment never visited the tables to see if customers were happy, I don't know I have lived here in Las Vegas 20 years and can not find a decent pizza if you want a real good pizza go to Harris Pizza in Rock Island Il. They grind their sausage like ground beef makes all the difference in the world.",1
"I would not choose to stay here again. We have stayed at many hotels over the years and while the Venetian has some nice amenities and restaurants, we were shocked to see that we had been unwittingly charged a 50 a day upgrade fee. When we checked in, this was not approved or discussed, it was simply hidden in the agreement that is not fully presented. When we went to check out, the woman at the desk refused to take care of the charge, disappeared for 15 minutes to talk with a supervisor, then came back and said she could not help as she had a signature on file. I asked to speak with the manager personally which took another ten minutes, and then, he proceeded to lecture me about this. The whole experience felt very shady and as if The Venetian is using this to up charge guests unknowingly. The supposed ""luxury suite "" we had supposedly also agreed to was little more than their standard suite on the 32nd floor. We have had much nicer views before in other hotels without this shady up charge business. Boo.",1
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here! n nI was in dire need of a fill in on my only night off work one week and couldn't make it to any of my usual favorite nail salons after running errands all day. Q Nails happened to be the only shop convenient to my area that was open later. You know how in horror movies the one lit up house on a darkened street is the exact one you shouldn't go into? I guess that stands for nail salons too. n nQ Nails has that kind of dismal, 90s strip mall vibe inside. Dated stock photos lined up on otherwise unpainted walls, basic cable flickering in and out on the overhead television, no music, loud, rows of clearly overworked technicians. Bummer. I'm the kind of girl who can get past all that, but when I was called over okay, hollered at to sit at a table, I noticed the kind of worn, not so sparkling appearance of the entire place. I told myself it was okay just a fill in, right? nAnd so it seemed. Until the next night when three of my nails broke yes, THREE. What was I doing to damage a fresh fill in so swiftly? Clapping. At an all ages concert. I'd hate to see the state my claws would've been in if I was actually rowdy. When I finally went to one of my regular salons, the technician actually asked where I'd gotten it done and shook her head. n nDo yourself and go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Like the Wal Mart nail salon is probably cleaner and better quality. But don't quote me on that, I'm the novice who wandered into the Last Nail Salon on the Left despite fellow Yelper's warnnings!",1
"I'm not a fan of buffets in general, so I ordered from the menu. The omelet I got was no better than what you'd get at waffle house. The service was pretty good, but the waitress seemed a little stressed even though it wasn't that busy. n nI love to go here, because I have a 2 year old that loves all things aviation. Being able to watch planes take off and land while you eat breakfast is a fun experience. The food and service could be better for what you pay.",1
"Where do i even began, I would recommend for no one to purchase any vehicle from ANY CarMax! I purchased a car from them and I believe it came with mechanical issues and of course CarMax in my opinion did not try to fix the issue they just brushed it off. The worst part about it is the car salesman that sold me this vehicle after me calling him multiple times telling him the issue DID NOT DO ANYTHING! And his name was RICKEY JORDAN. They are quick to take your money, but when crap hits the fan no one is there to help. No one should buy a car from this place because you might have to deal with headaches and stress! I would just recommend getting a car from a big car dealer as in Findley or Fletcher dealerships. I put so much money into this and no one there is qualified to help besides take your money that you worked HARD for and run off without a warning. IN OTHER TERMS THIS PLACE SUCKS! I REGRET EVERY SINGLE DAY EVEN STEPPING INTO THIS BUILDING!",1

"To begin, over the years I have stopped going to certain festivals because of the crowds. I value my space. I like to be able to jam out. LIB was perfect for that. No so many people that I couldn't dance without hitting anyone. but just enough people that I felt that festival family vibe. Sticking to the crowd topic, everyone really seemed to live the whole Life is Beautiful theme. I don't recall seeing any fights or any douche attitudes. I LOVED it. Even though I hardly knew anyone there, many folks were likely from out of town I'm new here. I felt that I was a part of the community. n nI did not attend last year, so I can't compare the lineups. but this year's lineup was insane to me! I got to check so many live sets off of my bucketlist. not to mention, see a few sets that I absolutely loved for a 2nd time. Phantogram. my lawd. I know, this is picking pretty deep but I wish they would have had Phantogram at night because their light show is INSANE! A few other notable acts. Outkast. crazy energy throughout the entire set! Foo Fighters. were wild! Dave is the man! The Weeknd third time seeing this guy put on a hell of a show, per usual. Kanye, Arctic Monkeys, Broken Bells, A Trak, Little Dragon. well, you can view the lineup yourself, everyone was amazing. I really appreciated the genre mixing, there was really something there for everyone. n nThe art. and maybe I just don't get out much, I'm not sure, but I've never seen so much amazing talent! I loved being able to walk around in between sets and check out all of the art and activities they had going on. The wall murals are sick and I'm glad they keep them up. Some of the pieces were somewhat interactive. a pink furry wall, the wire man who followed you in every direction. which I really appreciated. It'll be neat o to see more of that next year. n nIn and out privileges were EXTREMELY appreciated. with the location being so close to everything that fremont has to offer, it was nice to be able to leave and take a break at points to drink eat a little cheaper outside of the festival. The festival had plenty of bathrooms and I never had to wait in line. but it was also nice to be able to sneak away and use a real bathroom as well. n nHonestly though, if they did away with the in and out privileges for whatever reason it wouldn't be the end of the world because there were plenty of areas where you could dip away and relax. We had a wonderful experience chilling out in the Post Secrets dome. I have been a fan of Post Secrets for a while and being able to lay back in comfy seating and view postings above was so cool! We never even knew that you could go inside the dome at Container Park! Ha! n nMy only complaint was ride costs. There was really only one ride, the ferris wheel.and 5 per person to ride was really ridiculous. But, I can't complain too much because we rode it as Outkast was opening. Food and drinks didn't really seem to expensive to me comparing to other festivals.and the quality seemed much better. I really love that they showcased local food! I also appreciate the water station and the abundance of staff available to direct you to where you wished to go if asked. Everyone that I encountered was incredibly kind! This festival experience spoiled me! n nI will definitely be returning to LIB next year. this was a stellar event and a lovely group of people to be amongst. I really hope that they continue to progress. Life Is Beautiful definitely has my support.",2

"We tried to have a nice breakfast on Sunday morning. However the service rates as one of the worst I've experienced. First off, it took 10 minutes to place our drink order. The bartender had to come over because the service was so slow. Then after placing the order and waited for an hour, the waitress came by saying our order got mixed up. Can I tell you how difficult it is to entertain kids that long? Then when I asked for the manager to explain the enormous delay, manager did not come within 10 minutes. We left. If you have kids, DO NOT GET BREAKFAST HERE. Our bad for thinking this was a kid friendly restaurant.",1
I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food. The employees are courteous and the service is fast. The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in. I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees. I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.,2
"Sullivans has won me back. We went for Christmas Eve. The only problem was the reservation wasn't in the system but they got us in. We got the Seafood Tower. I had looked forward to the tower all week. I wasn't disappointed. Crab, lobster tails, Shrimp Cocktails, and oyster were all fresh and delicious. We had an excellent bottle of Viognier . We all ate bacon wrapped scallops. Yes, we ate seafood at a steak resturant because the get in fresh seafood several times a week. We had the best service that we have ever had at Sullivan's. I wish I could remember his name but he was originally from Ecuador. He was attentive and gracious but not in our face. It was a fabulous celebration for Christmas Eve.",2
"Meh. Came here again on a busy Saturday night around 8pm. Maybe since I had such an amazing first experience my expectations were too high. n nCustomer service was seriously lacking. The front desk girl was a little standoffish. I Just didn't feel welcomed. There was a mother with 3 kids that came in after me that was visiting for the first time asking general questions about signing up, price, etc and definitely got blown off. n nI'm not sure if the staff doesn't get breaks or if they get comfortable with the high amount of regulars that are there but 2 of 3 front desk girls were eating behind the service desk and 1 of the 2 employees in the track area was literally walking back and forth with a carry out tray nibbling with not a care in the world. Not professional. n nI really wish they could be more detailed and clear about what age group and experience levels should race with adults. A girl who looked about 12 14 raced with us it was her first time and definitely was creating safety hazards on the track. I'm barely decent on the track but geez. Girl was all over the track and many drivers had to keep braking and almost collide with her because she was riding the middle. She probably completed about 3 laps versus the average 7 9 so her being on the track was a serious issue. n nThe boyfriend paid for 2 games, I refused to stay for another so we will be returning for another round no refunds . hopefully I get a better experience next time.",1
"This place is perfect for a quick slice on the run or a late night on Mill Ave. They have a good variety of flavors and nice, friendly staff.",2
"Great cut. Walked in on a Sunday, no wait. Very friendly and super attentive. I'll be back.",2
"I must confess that this was my first time eating Salvadoran food. I don't know much about Salvadoran cuisine except that pupusas are a staple and after my first bite, I'm kicking myself for not trying pupusas earlier. I wish I ordered two! n nWhile nachos are pretty standard everywhere, I will say their beans are quite flavorful and doesn't seem to be the generic straight out of the can kind. It's really nothing to write home about but it was still tasty and I'm glad I shared because it was a pretty big portion . Their pupusas though. Oh my. Thick cornmeal tortillas filled with cheese and pork for around 2 a pop. It came with a cabbage slaw and this watery tomato salsa. I don't know if I was eating it correctly but I piled my pupusas with some slaw, sprinkled on the salsa, and tore into it with my hands. Hey, it strikes me as street food and ain't nobody got time for a fork and knife. It was bliss! The pupusas was delicious without the slaw and salsa but with everything on it, it was refreshing and even more flavorful. My mouth is drooling just thinking about today's lunch. n nCristina's is a nice clean restaurant with a slow but steady crowd. The cashier was friendly, answered all our noob questions, and was patient. Their staff size seems to consist of two people so it's a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth it. I'll definitely be sneaking over this gem of a place while I work. ",2
"After reading some of these reviews I feel pretty much the same. I wish i would've read them before i spent money on this! I got pretty much the same results nothing. There was only one review that was different and that was Johnny D who obviously works for them. I thought I'd try this because I saw it on Sonoran Living and thought they were pretty trustworthy. I don't like to exercise and it said no exercise required. So I traveled about 70 miles to and fro with my kids 3 times a week for 3 weeks. The customer service was horrible. I did mention to them that I wasn't seeing a difference and they kept telling me to wait until after the 9 week and the measurements would show the difference. After the 9th week the measurement showed no inches off. They told me that I was probably bloated, to give it time and to take pills to help let everything out. To this day its been about 3 months and there's absolutely no difference. I paid 1100. What a waste! I would never recommend this place. It's a money making scam and 3 on your side should investigate!",1
Awful restaurant! Filled with incompetent staff and terrible management. We've been to other Logan's locations in other states and always had a good experience. We will never go back to this location,1
"I recently went to Zinburger for a friends birthday they accept reservations for larger parties, which is The restaurant was packed, and they were still able to provide stellar service and serve amazing food! You can't go wrong with the Hava Chicken Sandwich and Double Truffle Fries!",2
"We tried Ketzal by Desert Ridge for the first time tonight and were very impressed by the friendly staff, fresh tasting food, and comfortable atmosphere. The salsa selection was especially fun, and the chips delicious. We'll be going again!",2
"Burger 21 always does right by us! The owner that we met is awesome and the food customer service is great! We've been here several times and love this establishment. It's always clean and they have a ""no touch required "" hand wash station behind the dining area that is very convenient. n nThe BBQ Bacon Burger is sooooo delicious! I've tried the Cinco de Mayo and Tex Mex Haystack wasn't a fan of them but the owner manager on duty definitely made up for it another reason we love this place . He personally came by to see how we were doing and offered to give us a new order but we were a little full from the fries and what we had eaten of the burgers already so instead gave us vouchers to come back and order something else AND free cookies lol! n nSo yes, we love Burger 21. Next on the ""to try "" list are the milkshakes and some non beef items. Oh and the basket of fries are always hot, fresh delicious. There are a ton of sauces at the condiment bar. Definitely can't forget about alllll of the sauces, thai ketchup being a favorite! This place is a must try for a great burger day or night. Hopefully I'll be able to move this to five stars once I try some of their other menu items NoMoreFiveGuysAfterThisPlace",2
Average ramen and not the greatest service. Other ramen restaurants were closed so came here for a late dinner.,1
"One of my favorite parts of being in Vegas is exploring all the amazing restaurants there. After doing some research on this Michelin rated restaurant the Caesars, I decided to come here with my girl friend on our first night in Vegas and had a wonderful experience. n nEveryone was really nice and warm, especially our waitress Alexis. She was very knowledgeable about all the food, and explained all the dishes to us in a very suave mannerism. Listening to her talk about the food was like music to our ears. We did not decide on the special prix fixe dinner, but instead ordered the bar prix fixe and a side order of their famous cod, which was amazing. it was super tender, juicy, and flavorful. A little bit pricey as a single entree though, so if you're going to get that, getting the prix fixe that includes that is a better deal. n nWe really wanted to try the kobe beef slider burgers that's on the bar menu that everyone raves about, so we got that prix fixe which included a caesar salad even that was super fresh and tasty , the burger, and then a dessert that had a sugar cookie and a tirimisu mousse cup. They said that they didn't have the kobe beef anymore, but it was the wagyu, which was still super high grade. The burger was undeniably one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was sooooooooo juicy and flavorful and just omg, mouthgasm. The dessert was just ok, but must compliment on the breads here! They're served fresh out of the oven and still warm, and the mini ones that are sweet and the little muffins are just so good! I got seconds and still finished everything. n nOverall, it was a good experience that I enjoyed a lot. But maybe because I've been spoiled by going to Joel and Daniel Bouloud already in the past, this is stil 4 stars to me. Perhaps one day when I come back again I will get the full prix fixe, but I would definitely want to just come by the bar and get a burger! D",2
"My friend and I were told about this place and warned it had a ""younger crowd "" I have been warned ""young crowd "" can be very young. My friend insisted on trying it her being several years younger than me I guess she was more okay with that . n nWe were let right in on a busy night and we coughed up our 4 cover charge. n nI want my 4 back. actually I want more since I was traumatized. n nWalking into the club after a few flights of stairs first tip off this wasn't the place for me was the comic style naked lady art decor , and I walked in to be absolutely assaulted by the smell of body odor. Very sickly strong BO. I fought really hard not to be sick the smell was that bad. n nAs for atmosphere, I would imagine it's like the movie ""Step Up "" but in the thug ghetto. I was honestly scared. It's a meat market as well, which just added a lot to the creepy feel. I refused to buy a drink because I questioned the entire cleanliness. I thought about taking my Chanel earrings out because I was nervous of being robbed and cursed my decision to carry my designer handbag. n nNeedless to say, I was out of their ASAP and i don't think you could actually pay me enough to go back.",1
"I used to go to hurt cafe, but now I have found a place with amazing espresso which is local to me and more convenient. Even if the service was terrible I would still come here because of the quality of the bean , however the service has been great so far and I am happy",2
"I stayed here for 2 nights while in Charlotte for business. It's a very nice hotel. The front desk clerk was very personable, friendly and accomodating. My room was really nice and spacious. I had a view of the city which was nice but I didn't get to really enjoy since I was not in the room much. The bed. Heavenly. The Westin is known for their Heavenly beds and it definitely was. High thread count sheets and fluffy pillows. the best night sleep I've ever had while on vacation. I thought about working out at the nice gym but the bed. couldn't get out of it. Room service was good, but expensive. 12 for pastries and fruit?! Well it is room service and when is that ever cheap? Had a nice stay and will probably stay here again if I have to come back to visit.",2
"I was not a Beatles fan before seeing this show, but my wife was and I love seeing a new show, so. n nThis show was excellent! The visual effects were stunning and the dancers were excellent. The music was woven seamlessly into the performance and all I can say was WOW! I'm a Beatles fan now! n nThere was not a bad seat in the house! I think you're actually better off sitting a little higher just to make sure you can see everything.",2
I wouldn't call it gourmet. I'd call it average at best. Kids do get a discount and under 3 years old are free.,1
Superb customer service! I went in to have spinning cleats put on my shoes. . . the gal sorry don't know her name who helped me was so courteous and helpful. I'll take all my cycling needs here.,2
"When we were there around Thanksgiving time we asked the front desk staff to recommend a place to eat nearby the hotel and they suggested this place. The decor is charming and it went downhill from there. n nThe hostess acted like she was doing us a favor leading us to our table. The main server was short on attentiveness and personality but his assistant was a joy. He made sure water glasses were filled and more bread was brought out when we asked for it and he always had a smile. We saw him more than the main in white jacket server guy. n nThe food was no big deal for the price. It was just adequate. Where they totally dropped the ball was desert! I ordered the warm pineapple upside down cake. I assumed warm cake meant it was brought out to you warm. Ummmmmmmm, no! It was cake that was brought out to the table and then presented flambe. n nNow flambe is one thing and I have no issues with it. Having the dish placed in front of me, the server pouring the flammable liquid on it and splashing me with it and then lighting the thing in front of my OMG am I going to have a Michael Jackson hair on fire moment here not cool! n nThe pineapple on the cake melted so much that it was too gooey to chew and the taste of the rum was more than I could take. Normally when something is presented flambe they pour the liquid and light the dish AWAY from you and the alcohol evaporates enough before you try and eat it. I could only manage a couple of forkfuls before I shoved it away. I contacted the management later and we had a nice discussion especially about how not to scare the out of a customer with flames. n nWould we go back to this place when we return to Arizona? How about no.",1
"I found myself wondering how they could possibly make anything more amazing and luxurious than the Wynn. n nThis place will blow your mind! So stunning, more cohesively designed thank the original tower in my opinion. n nso apparently this is the only place to go now.not to mention a ton of new places to dine and XS. n nXS is the most stunning place EVER. I am a huge fan of Tryst and the service they provide there. n nTryst had two problems n1.not enough bathrooms n2.not enough stripper poles n nThey seriously solved the hell out of both of these problems! Stripper poles disguised as very large chic light fixtures and more restroom stalls than Giant's Stadium. The whole club is so stunning, no doubt it will be the number 1 spot in vegas.",2
"Not good at all. Very soggy fries, tastes like they're straight from the freezer. And the mozzarella sticks were OKAY. Disappointed in the marinara.tastes like old tomato sauce. One star for good customer service. Won't be back though.",1
"WHY has no one reviewed the Pork Ragout? Well I'm about to remedy that. This is Zan, posting on Janet's profile, because I can. So a friend of ours came to visit and we wanted to take her to dinner. Salty Sow is right around the corner from our house, and we've been wanting to try it. It was this, or BBQ and our friend hates BBQ what? . So we packed ourselves into the car for that one block yeah, I know. but I knew we'd stuff ourselves and have a hard time rolling back home , and showed up at the old Sow. It was a Monday night, so it wasn't terribly crowded, and we were seated right away. I wish I could remember our server's name, because he was very nice and on top of everything from the moment we sat down. Sorry, man! But if you remember 3 larger women coming in and acting like we were drunk off our asses, laughing and giggling at everything. that was us. We weren't drunk, promise this is just how we are when we get together. n nAnyway, so because we had read so much about the duck fat fries, of course we had to try that. Being Monday night, it was Happy Hour all night long, so we got the smaller Happy Hour version. Glad we did, but wish we didn't. We ended up eating so much that night, glad we saved the room. But wish we didn't because they were just. that. good. Janet had recently been to Gordon Ramsay's London restaurant in LA with her daughter, and loved their duck fat fries. but she said hands down, Salty Sow's were far better. And the Bearnaise sauce was really tasty. n nWhile we were chowing down on those fries, Janet and our friend decided on drinks. Janet had the Mojito, I believe. and it was strong! They do not skimp on the booze here. very nice. Josie, our friend, had the Salty Sow Sparkling Sangria. She was a little confused by the mint leaves they put in there, but overall really enjoyed it. I was the DD, and even for just one block I had myself a Coke. it was very Coke like. n nNext up were the main courses. Our waiter really wish I could remember his name recommended Josie try the Crisp Chicken Thighs, and said Janet's choice of the Bacon and Eggs was an excellent one. When I chose the Pork Ragout, though, his eyes about glazed over. I knew right then I had chosen well. nSo the meals arrived, and we dug in. Josie enjoyed the chicken, but was absolutely in love with the little crispy fingerling potatoes the chicken rested on. I had a bite myself, and the chicken was moist and delicious, but I agree those potatoes rocked. Janet's bacon and eggs over grits were quite good, but maybe because I'm a huge crispy bacon fan, I wasn't that impressed with the pork belly. It didn't have any crunch, and the flavor was lacking to me. BUT it was tasty enough that I have zero complaints. But oh my goodness, when that ragout was placed in front of me, I knew I was in for a treat and was I right. The tomato sauce was perfect, didn't overpower the pork or the polenta. The pork was tender and flavorful. And the polenta was creamy and, I think, even a little cheesy. But the combo of flavors with the basil and the parmesan was amazing. The flavors just burst in my mouth and I was thisclose to actually licking my plate clean. Sadly, our main courses came to an end and we sat and mourned a few moments, before deciding on dessert! n nSo because we were so impressed with our meals at the Salty Sow, we felt like it would be travesty to not indulge in their sweets. Now, I'm a salty sweet fiend, so the Butterscotch Boudino really called out to me. but then, so did the Bananas Foster Beignets. Janet, on the other hand, was craving chocolate, so she wanted to try the Dark Chocolate Truffle Cake. We figured Josie would be the tie breaker. So when she chose the Bananas Foster Beignets, I thought that would be that. Nope! Janet insisted we try ALL THREE! Oh yeah.commence drooling. Let's start with the cake. I'm not a dark chocolate fan, so I passed. Janet said it was actually a little TOO sweet, so she had a few bites and we took the rest home. The BFB as they shall be called from here on, were amazeballs, as Josie might say. Wait. would Josie say that? Who says that? Anyway. the fried batter was crispy and sweet, but not too sweet. The bananas had a very tasty honey sauce that wasn't too overpowering, either. And the ice cream was good, too. Nothing to really write Yelp about, but decent. Overall, a fantastic dessert. But that Boudino? Oh my word. my taste buds had died and gone to heaven. The Boudino itself is a pudding of sorts it had the texture and taste of cheesecake to us. It was light and fluffy and perfect. The whipped cream Creme Fraiche added a nice variety of texture, and the butterscotch sauce was smooth and perfectly salty sweet, just as I like it. and the added touch of a little sea salt on top was a delightful surprise. n nI'm bringing EVERYONE here now! And I'm outta room. more details on the next visit, promise!",2
"This mall is the worst in Las Vegas! The only plus is a Mervyns, but that lacks a lot in selection. They have many rules and will try to kick you out! It is hard to find close parking. The mall is always empty and stores have noticed that which is why some stores are closed, such as KB Toys, Franklin Covey, and Spencer's Gifts. The food court never has clean seating and there is even a perfume shop and a cigarette newspaper store in the food court, which is very strange.There's only 2 outparcels that I like and that is Scholtzky's and LensCrafters, or maybe its Eyemasters, not sure.",1
Really enjoyed our first visit here with the Living Social deal! Friendly staff and great place for families with young kids!,2
"Sorry can't be ignored by 6 employees with 2 customers in the store 1 being myself and wait 15 minutes to talk to someone. Offer me a water or say ""thanks for waiting we'll be right with you "". Do something, your in the customer service industry for crying out loud.",1
"If I could rate it a negative 5 I would. Tonight my friends and I went to the Rhumbar to smoke some hookah and have a couple of drinks. We called prior to coming over and were told the prices for the hookah and that's it. So we drove over, fought traffic and all, just to get here and Duke tells us 3 women that there's a cover of 10 for everyone. Now this isn't an issue but it became an issue when we noticed the group in front of us didn't pay a cover and walked right in. So pissed off, we walked away. Something told me to call and check. So I did. And low and behold, there was no cover for women just men. Highly upset, we stormed back over and approached Duke. of course, the story changed and all of a sudden he claims he only told us that because there was a group of guys near us and he didn't want them to question the cover. Bullcrap! There was only 1 man near us when he told us that. So it makes me question the integrity of the business. Was it because it was 2 black women and a Latina woman wanting to come spend money? Clearly there's some discrimination going on. This is how lawsuits get started. Someone should check Duke before this business goes under the magnifying glass for racial and sex discrimination. n nHighly pissed, but the only reason we came back was because my best friend really waned to do hookah for her birthday. Wow. n nSigned, nPissed off PAYING customer",1
"Icon, you've left me speechless and not in a good way. Luckily, I can still write! n nI have been coming here for years, and I adore the Iconic tapas.particularly anything involving short ribs or flank steak. Or flatbreads. Somehow, it has always slipped my mind to yelp about this place. So it's very IRONIC that last night, when I visited with the full intention of remedying that oversight, Icon fell flat on its face. n nI'm incredibly cranky about this whole experience, and I am not going to pull any punches. Here's how it went down. I signed myself and my sister up for the Valentine's day prix fixe menu. 48 per plate. 4 courses. ICON. Money well spent, right? WRONG! I had issues with EVERY course. Not to mention that we had our coats on for the entire meal to ward off the arctic blasts each time the door opened. n nNow, I have to say that I went against my better judgement, which tells me to avoid seafood in the Midwest. However, it WAS featured prominently on a very expensive menu, so I thought what the hell? I bit I went with the crab cakes in the first course. They made me want to jump the first plane to Maryland so I could remind myself what good crab cakes taste like. The crab had that distinctive frozen flavor that you wouldn't expect in a high end establishment . The cakes were otherwise dense and semi gross. But I dug the saffron aioli.for whatever that's worth. n nFor the second course, I chose the CREAM OF asparagus soup. I can't stress this enough any chef should be embarrassed by what we were served. I emphasize ""cream of, "" because the soup clearly had not been uniformly pur u00e9ed and strained, as evidenced by the occasional spoonful of overcooked asparagus chunks. Moreover, the soup was crying out for salt which was notably absent from our table. Really? REALLY?! n nTHIS IS BASIC STUFF, PEOPLE. n nFor the entree I chose lobster pappardelle, which was okay, but not memorable. My sister picked the standout of the meal the porcini and truffle ravioli was fantastic, and I would have licked her plate if nobody else had been in the room. n nAnd dessert? I opted for the chocolate mousse. The presentation was a curious cross between something my puppy would have done and liver pate with birthday candles. I did venture a taste, and it was fine but again, not memorable. I didn't detect the cardamom. n nSo in short, I am pissed that I spent 48 per plate for a meal that was poorly executed. n nSo, Icon.maybe I'll be back someday. Maybe I'll write a glowing update. But right now, I just don't see it.",1
"I've been looking for other movie theaters other than brenden theaters. I'm glad I found Rave! This place is pretty massive and such a convenient location!

Shopping malls should look more like townsquare! n nOk, so Rave is awesome and I will be coming back again!",2
"I think this is where the ASU sorority b!tches go for employment when Christie's Cabaret isn't hiring. n nThe service isn't the worst I've had, but they aren't over the top friendly either. The decor and atmosphere is very cool and I loved the vibe but the food tastes like taco bell. Actually make that Filiberto's Filisquirtos because Taco Bell tastes pretty damn good after too many drinks. n nI liked the house margarita a lot and a friend talked me into a watermelon margarita which was pretty good too but it wasn't blended too well we were a group of 14 on a saturday so maybe they got busy and couldn't blend the margaritas.I don't know . n nI'd go back for the house margaritas and an appetizer chips and guacamole but I don't think I'll eat dinner here again. n nTry Barrio Cafe.that place freaking ROCKS!",1
"So, I wrote a review on this place a while back about how this place was unfriendly to tattooed people and wouldn't even let me get close to the front door and was pleased to see that I got a little apology from the owner.

My experience wasn't the kind that you can go, ""Sorry for the service "" And Thank you so much for cutting and pasting this generic apology on every bad review Cadillac ranch gets. Didn't think we would notice that? By you doing that, It honestly just showed me that you truly didn't care about making it right at all by actually reading what happened in my experience there and apologizing for it. Instead you picked all the reviews with one star and stuck the same apology over and over hoping that would be enough to appease the public. I would say I have never been so insulted in my life but if you actually take the two minutes out of your busy day to actually read my review this time. you will obviously see otherwise. Thank you ""Jessica "" and Cadillac ranch staff for once again showing your true colors when it comes to customer service by doing the bare minimum. nNext time actually read the review. n Thank you ",1
Poor service delivered by a staff who act as if they are hating the work. Food is average but so is the price. Given the wide range of choices in the Mexican category in Phoenix there is no reason to visit this one at all.,1
Outstanding stone crab. Great atmosphere and even greater service. I highly recommend Joe's if you love great food and service especially if you love to people watch.,2
"In the top 5 best restaurants in Charlotte. A couple of stumbles on my visit kept them from getting 5 stars, but you can sense they are typically great. Also, a couple of flavor profiles did not deliver like I thought they would. n nThe Good n First, the restaurant. Incredibly cozy, perfect lighting, ambiance, all the touches in here are amazing. A lot of thought went into aesthetics and it shows. From the curb appeal to the restrooms, it's well thought out and well done. I probably would have put a knee wall between the lower tables and the bar height tables, but I did get to check out a lot of shoes. n The menu, very well thought out, covers a wide range of both techniques and origins of products. The only thing missing for me was more shrimp or other crustaceans n Lettuce wraps very well balanced, great flavors, perfect n Smoked Salmon just right blend of oil, capers, seasoning. The egg mixture was ridiculously awesome n Steamed bun in thought was very cool. The bread was perfect. I was expecting a bigger flavor experience though. The veggies gave a nice crunch but almost negated the softness of the bread. Cool item maybe being a little picky . n Carbonara great flavor, but was looking for raw egg yolk. n Ramen was beautiful and tasty, although a little light in flavor given the bbq pork. I added a little salt and it ate very well. n nThe Bad n Service, our was not engaging at all, but we could see others had much better service. Hostess was much more attentive to us than our server. This was the biggest disappointment. n Goat cheese and pear salad. The salad was really small but the mixed greens were really big with just a smidgen of pair. Ate poorly and struggled to get all ingredients in every bite. Micro greens would have been much better. n Falafel, my 4th time having a falafel and by far the worst. The Greek yogurt had so much cilantro it killed everything else. Did not enjoy n Chocolate dessert can't remember name was too gritty. Texture was not enjoyable. n nWe will go back again and again, but will make sure to get a better server. We saw the great ones, it just wasn't ours. nI would also just go back, drink a glass of wine and soak up the ambiance truly awesome.",2
"Now if only there was a Brennan's in California. n nAnyway, this place has some fresh produce and all kinds of cheese more than I've ever seen in my life! Then again, I never went to Wisconsin until recently. With an assortment of samples throughout the store, customers can get a little taste of what Brennan's offers. I bought the smoked string cheese and smoked beef sticks. I usually don't eat beef on a stick but this is definitely an exception. n nI thought it was cool how the store offered wine samples. My friends who are 21 and over got a kick out of this because sampling all kinds of cheese, along with the small wine sample, must be an even cooler store experience. n nIf I ever get the chance to go to the Madison area of Wisconsin again, I will surely come back here and buy more than just cheese and beef sticks! It's also a great place to stop by to grab some stuff before having a jolly picnic by Lake Mendota.",2
"I've been to RdTR on 4 separate occasions. each with the hope that the previous visits were just bad nights. What can I say. We live within a mile of the place and will never go back. nDishes have always been prepared with a lack of focus and flavor that should define this cuisine. I had their braised pork which was so dry, I would swear they used loin instead of shoulder. nOn a separeate occasion, we brought out of town friends and they pointed out how interesting their 'smoked' refried beans were. I tasted them and commented that there was no such thing. Their beans were burnt. Fish tacos just ok. Burritos go elsewhere for 1 2 the price. Rellenos not really rellenos. n nIf you want real Mexican food, look elsewhere. If you want to eat at a really charismatic place, wait for 45 minutes for a table and leave feeling like Garcias would have been more authentic, then this is your place. n nUPDATE After moving away from Arizona and coming back to visit family, I relented and tried this place again. I really want to like you Tia Rosa, but sadly, no change. What is it? Why? This is a Mexican food place in ARIZONA and it should be the bomb. But its not and I don't think ever will be.

"So another review long in the making! n nThis is by no means your average Chinese Take Away. even though they do take away, strike that from your thoughts if like me it conjures up thoughts of sub par Chinese food that is pretty much the same up and down the UK. n nThat said, some may find this place a bit too adventurous compared to your standard Chinese establishment. if you've been to Red Chilli somewhere else in the UK then cross that place with one of the better take aways even though this isn't a take away , and you may have an idea of what this nplace is like. It's not as posh or big as Red Chilli, but still takes the off the beaten path approach to some of it's dishes. n nFor an example of dishes I've liked. the Pan fried Dumplings Stuffed with Juicy Pork were good and definitely seemed home made. the Salt Pepper Squid was cooked perfectly, but I do wish it had been cooked with chillies and garlic as well and may ask if they can work that one out next time. I can't fault them for it as it is though, it's not Chilli Garlic Squid after all. n nMy favourite dish, that keeps me coming back, is the Boneless Szechuan Style Chicken with Chilli Pepper in Deep Fry. it is simply crazy if salt and heat are your things. I'm literally craving it now just thinking about all of those peppercorns and dried chillies. nom! It won't be for everyone, but if a salty and spicy dish sounds up your alley then perhaps worth a go. n nFor starters, I actually really like the Mixed Jellyfish which seems to surprise them. it has a great garlic taste, but one that I wouldn't fault. n nFor more basic fare, I've had the Fried Noodles really enjoyed, not too oily and the Shrimp Fried Rice on par with better take aways, a bit oily but with good flavour . to counter this however they offer things like nCucumbers with Garlic Sauce, exactly as it sounds, to offer a healthy alternative. n nI could actually go on about the different foods that I personally like, but I think if you came here with a few friends and or ordered a few dishes you would figure out if the food was for you. I've had things I haven't loved, and things that really stood out, but the biggest compliment I can pay is that I look forward to exploring the menu. n nOn to the place itself. adequate probably sums it up to be honest. nothing mind blowing, but nothing bad either. it seems to have just enough space, I've never been turned away at a busy period, but I have ngotten the last available table. generally it seems quite calm, but as others have mentioned there is normally a group or two of Chinese people there eating all sorts of wonders I'm so crashing one of their feasts one day! which is a good sign I suppose. n nThe staff are brilliant, but can be a little rough with English. I don't fault that however I mean, ask me to speak Chinese! and I actually find it a bit charming, it never gets in the way in the end regardless. n nThe downsides to me are the varying hours. I'm not a fan of ""open until nlate "". I think Yelp and some other places have posted hours, but trust me. call if it's past 9pm. they are definitely open late sometimes, but I've also shown up at 9pm to find them closed on two occasions. They also seem to be less accepting towards cards towards the tail end of the night, nbut otherwise accepts them. n nRegardless, these guys have also gone out of their way holding pick up orders for me and creating home made chilli sauces so personally I let the weird hours and card policies slide. I wouldn't be so forgiving had the service been bad, but I can't pretend that's the case. n nAll in all, I'll definitely be back and am grateful that these guys are in Fountainbridge.",2
"Very disorganized and rude. lost my order and try to blame it on me, I went down to the location to show him my confirmation email and he still tried to say it was my fault the order was not in his system. The Tempe location is absolutely amazing, use them if possible!",1
Amazing customer service ! I had walked in to the store looking for a specific item. The item was OUT OF STOCK and was pulled out of the website just then. The lady at the store took my information and called me back a month and a half later stating that they had reintroduced the item on their website and she wanted to let me know. She was a Santa in disguise and her name is Leslie ! I would absolutely recommend this store against the other Burberry stores in LV.,2
"If you up for something new and have a hearty appetite, this might be a good place to check out. n nOffering both a vegetarian option and a meat option The Brazillian Grill allowed our whole group an option. First, the building is from 1910 or close to but it is beautifully restored. Great atmosphere and a comfy feel. We sat on some nice couches in the downstairs bar which had good prices and good service. n nThe main dining room was impressive and had a great feel. We were a little bummed out to find the 'stage' empty as they sometimes offer live music. We went on a Saturday night pretty much expecting it, but was told that they have music more on weeknights to try to draw people on less busy nights. n nDinners basically split into two 'acts' the salad bar which is set up as a buffet and offers a large variety of items. Most were not your run of the mill and everyone in our group enjoyed trying different things. The next was the meat and the Goucho's would come around with skewers of different meats to try. Our group sampled everyone that was offered. Our favorite by far was the Flank Steak which had a wonderful flavor and was very tender. Bacon wrapped filets were probably second favorite. n nOver all a very good time The only two things bad I can say is that because of its location parking can be a problem. They do have an attached lot, but it was full we went. There is a public lot a half block up but this was also hard to get into and the meters only allowed for 2 hour parking. The second thing was our waitress. Although the Goucho's were great, we did have a waitress to bring us drinks and explain what was going on. She was slow and massively screwed up our bill when we tried to run it on separate cards. Fortunately she was a minor screw up in a good night of fun.",2
"I was there everyday for the month of March for Spring training. The place is friendly and the prices can not be bet. I had one bad server, but management responded A.S.A.P. I was impressed. This is a plus for Scottsdale.",2
This Dominos location has never disappointed us. The freshness and quality of their pizza is always spot on not to mention their customer service. They are always quick to deliver and friendly at the door!,2
"I'm digging these new CityCenter properties in the mid Strip area. Thumbs up for the clean modern design aesthetic Vdara utilizes that makes the room feel a little more like an upscale condo and less like a run of the mill hotel room. Well, I guess the fact there's a kitchen with a stove probably contributes more to that ""homey "" feel too. n nI liked that the shower door didn't leak. Sounds kinda dumb to point that out, but I had a small lake replete with fish pooling around my shower at Palazzo. The sink was one of those trendy rectangular models that looked cool but functionally sucked. The near flat bottom made sure that draining water never drained well, and when there's two guys shaving with razors it meant splashing water around futilely trying to clean up the place for the next person. n nI absolutely loved the fact that I didn't need to walk six kilometers through a smokey casino to go from the lobby to the guest elevators. In fact, there is no casino at Vdara and the closest one is probably Cosmo next door. The downside is that there's no direct connection to Cosmo, but it's not a big deal. Vdara is connected via walkway to its sister property Bellagio. It's a long route to take, but made easier if you make a pit stop at Jean Philippe's for some chocolate. n nThe beds were comfy, the room nicely appointed and we had a decent view looking north towards the water show at Bellagio. The gym wasn't huge with maybe 10 treadmills ellipticals and a dozen machines plus free weights, but it was also so empty that it wasn't a factor. Plenty of towels and water made a quick workout a breeze. Good location and everything above makes it a solid 4 stars for me. Looking forward to my next stay here.",2
"Only reason to be here if you really want one n You have the 24 hr BUFFET pass.and are a craving fruits OR b want to drink until you drop on bottomless cheap beers Coors Miller Light or house wine ask for a price of 10.without hitting the casino clubs pubs 7 11 n nAs for all else n the food is SUB PAR.and as expected ie clams mussels are.UGH, a disaster prime rib is at its RUBBER prime.and the New York strip.is as hard as the New York Brick that makes up Wall Street Mexican food section looks and tastes like it was rummaged out of a trashcan SERIOUSLY n can't say much about service when you're a platinum diamond holder but by observing other tables.they are pretty nice! n OH YEAH, while normal guests have the cold crab legs, Platinum Diamond section gets STEAMED crab legs, which, IMHO, are a LOT better n nAmbiance n lots and lots and LOTS of elderly people I'd say that's a good thing if the food was GREAT because the lines to any great items would be SHORT .BUT as mentioned earlier, the food is pretty much sub par.",1
"Amazing selection, quite tasty but generally not quite delicious food. Fish was nicely cooked, and sushi was reasonably fresh. Pastas seemed a bit warmed over, and the desserts were uniformly too sweet for my taste. n nStill, though, with at least a handful of standouts smoked salmon! shrimp cocktail!, surprisingly tasty pizza! . you're likely to get your money's worth if you're at all hungry, especially if you're impressed by the insane variety of foods like I was. n nI actually went twice. once Thursday night at 9 30pm for a late dinner 29.95 , and then again Saturday at about 2 30pm for ""brunch "" 23.95, if I remember correctly . n n'twas no line at all on Thursday, and I feel that the food was of better quality than on Saturday for some reason. On Saturday, I learned that pretty much all non alcoholic drinks were included in the buffet price, including a fab fresh squeezed and bottomless orange juice not sure if that's true also for the dinners as well. n nAll in all, I'd recommend at least one trip to this buffet to all Vegas goers, though next time I think I'll stick to fixed portion very high quality meals for the sanity of my waistline and energy levels I felt kinda like a slug for the rest of the day after stuffing myself on Saturday!

"I am still so angry over my recent experience here last week, and I feel this is the only way people will truly know what an awful pharmacy this is. Now to be fair, I have loved this pharmacy for years. The techs all knew my family and our meds and we never had a problem. However in the last month, they got a new pharmacist ""Ron "" and subsequently lost a lot of their techs. My son has autism and is on quite a few meds that cannot be missed due to dangerous side effects so we always try to keep everything filled before they run out and this pharmacy always did an excellent job. All of a sudden this last week, meds weren't filled at all. The wait times were ridiculous, for example I waited 45 min in drivethru for them to not have them ready. I was told ""tomorrow "" four times last week. Finally my poor son was completely out of his meds and missed over a days worth. When I came home Friday evening after a long day working in cardiac surgery my boy was pacing back and forth and so upset. He had a horrible day at school and was dizzy. It was a little before 8 they close at 10 so I went to the pharmacy to see if they finally had his scripts filled and I also had scripts that his doc had given us that day. n nWhen I got to the pharmacy there were a couple people waiting, and I'm not sure how many were waiting in line outside. I could see the pharmacist and techs were busy and he was yelling at his staff. I dropped the scripts off and said I would wait. The tech whispered to the pharmacist Ron and told him we were completely out of meds. He was very rude and said ""absolutely not, we are too far behind to fill these tonight "". She apologized to me and said they couldn't fill them. They had two hours left before closing! I explained to him that we had waited all week for the one script and he was completely out of meds. He said he couldn't do ""anymore favors "". Really?! Favors!? He told me it was my fault for not getting there earlier that day. Well excuse me for having to take care of patients late. This is what we do in healthcare! I explained that and he should know this it is dangerous to miss psych meds and my son was already symptomatic. He told me it wasn't his problem and that he was going to have to stay late if he filled my scripts and here I got off late taking care of a critically ill patient. Amongst other horrifying things, he said he didn't care if he lost our family as customers. The tech even pleaded with him to make an exception and fill it and he snapped at her as well. I repeat, they had two hours and I would have been more than willing to wait until they closed. I was in tears at that point and I admit I did finally raise my voice and told him we were done with this pharmacy and would be going elsewhere. He told me nobody in town would be able to help me that night.again, two hours until closing! n nFortunately, there was a happy ending. The CVS down the road on sossaman took pity on a tearful, exhausted nurse and filled my scripts within 30 min. They apologized for my treatment at the other store and told me that store had recently lost a lot of employees because of this new pharmacist and had been sending other fed up customers to them. As a healthcare employee, we are supposed to be dedicated to our community and those in need of care. What a sorry excuse for a ""healthcare professional ""!",1
"I would give them 5 stars for the food. I was stationed in Schweinfurt, Bayern Bavaria and the food here at Bavarian Point is just as good as it was in Deutschland. Their veal Cordon Bleu is the best I've ever had. Everything made fresh, by hand, filled with flavor, and is decently priced. n nI, unfortunately, must agree with the other raters re decor and cleanliness. The interior needs a complete overhaul. Not saying that the structure is about to fall down but there are quite a few aesthetic items that really need to have some pumped into them. n nService is decent not top notch, but never rude. We usually arrive right when they open so that we receive ""full attention. "" The times we have been there when the bar has been full usually result in more attention being paid to the drinkers than the eaters. So we time our visit accordingly. n nTheir desserts are phenomenal. Can't say enough about that. n nSo my thought would be that if you're looking for top notch food and are not that concerned with decor and service, you ought to check them out they are more than authentic. If service is a deal breaker, maybe go somewhere else.",2
"Stayed at Encore this past weekend. Worse Vegas hotel customer service experience. n nI drove from California early in the morning and had to wander around Vegas to wait for check in time, and the last thing I wanted was to stand at the check in counter and argue with the staff for 10 minutes to prove I booked with a promo code to get my room. n nThe room was beautiful and the beds were comfy, but it already put a bad impression in my head. n nUpon check in, customer service was horrible. I explained to the lady behind the desk that I had booked the room via the website under a room upgrade code, as long as there were room availability. She refused to honor the code, stating that she did not see anything in my account about the upgrade. After arguiing with her and pulling up the website for her on my iphone for her to see the deal, she barely glanced at the site and stated that she did not see anything. She did not apologize nor offer to look into the matter. She continued to tell me that I would need to pay an additional 50 for the room upgrade. After about 10 minutes, she finally called room reservations, in which they double checked the website and finally acknowledged the deal and then allowed my room upgrade at no additional charge which I was entitled to in the first place, upon availabilty . She was not entirely apologetic for doubting me, which shows lack of customer service skills to me. Even the room reservation person had to check the website to see what promotion I was referring to. Isn't that their job to know what deals they have available, especially if I am booking from their website? n nIn addition, I had an issue with the concierge. As I was walking to my room, I spoke to the concierge desk about purchasing XS passes. I clearly stated that I needed to go back to my room to ask my friends whether we wanted to purchase our club passes through concierge or try our luck and stand in line for XS and pay only 20 for the entry fee. I asked if it would be okay to order over the room phone if we decided to purchase passes through concierge, and she stated that it was completely fine, and that I would just need to show my ID upon picking up my tickets. When I got back into my room, we decided to pay the 25 and purchase from concierge. The concierge was hesitant to reserve my tickets for me telling me that I had to go back downstairs and reserve in person. After I explained to her about my previous conversation, she reluctantly reserved my tickets for me. n nI can't understand why the staff is so reluctant to be helpful and everything is a NO or an argument with them. Instead of being 2 steps ahead of the clients, they are 10 steps backward.",1
Best fish tacos I have had in Las Vegas.,2
This hole in the wall mexican restaurant has been around for years! Authentic mexican food is delish! Breakfast plates are all soo good! Especially their all you can eat menudo or pozole! I love their stuffed green chile shredded beef chilaca style for appetizer mmmm! Can't go wrong with any chimichangas! My fav is the 2 green chile shredded beef enchiladas with rice n beans. Rice isn't red though but it is still delish! All their soups are amazing. As for dinner the carne asada plate and mixed fajitas are money!,2

"Had the same experience as Candy, to a ""T. "" n nWent in a little late without realizing they were closing soon with myself and a few friends. We are all adults, but we look young for our ages. I entered the store, and was then treated like I was a criminal. No welcome in, nothing. Just a quick, ""We are closing soon, "" and someone followed me around after someone phoned another employee to keep an eye on us. n nI understand loss prevention is a part of business, but please do so discreetly. I want to feel welcome when I'm shopping somewhere, otherwise I don't want to continue shopping there.",1
"I gotta say The Keg is definitely one of my favorite steak franchises. Food is always good and the steak is done to perfection. Along with a bottle wine, good company and you're good for the night.

"Thank you fellow Yelper ""s for helping me find my new favorite ramen restaurant in Las Vegas Monta Noodle House. n nThe place is a hole in the wall place and has only been in business for a month now, but don't let that hold ya back! The place is clean with awesome service. n nI went with the Tonkotsu Ramen that's the BOMB! The soup is so tasty and pork is perfectly cooked. n nThe ramen is as good if not better then some of the ramen joints in So Cal. I'll definitely be returning here in the future.",2
"Food and selection is best for southeast Asian cuisine. I would the Pho isn't as good as other places in town, but the bun, stir fry noodles, and curries are great. Prices are very reasonable. I would frequent the place more if service wasn't so slow! It's much more convenient on the weekends.",2
"Steve Wynn himself threw down the gauntlet on the in room TV service when he scoffed at being compared to New York style pizza, and said he was setting out to do one better. When you make that kind of claim, you better back it up, or at least make it respectable. n nNope. Serving a slice of pizza as big as your head doesn't make it good. The pizza reeked of that same old game ""We try to be like NY pizza but we fail miserably at it. "" It's infinitely more disappointing than a bad pizza shop that does it their own way. But if you're doing to imitate something, at least get it right. n nAnyway, the one saving grace is that their chicken wings were actually good! Very good amount of heat, more than I expected, and they were at least a bit crispy something that shocked me. Out here I've become used to the sogfests that they try to pass off as ""crispy "" wings!",1
"Called ""Cathy "" to schedule an estimate for some stucco repair and exterior painting. ""Cathy "" was a space cadet on the phone and acted like she suffers from a severe case of ADHD. I went ahead and scheduled an estimate since the ratings were so good. ""Cathy "" agreed to come by on a set date for an estimate. n nScheduled date came and went. Called a few days later to find out why I hadn't been contacted. I wanted to give her time to work in the estimate if she was busy. No answer. No call back. No scheduled visit. After a week I called again and left another message. ""Cathy "" finally called me back and after a few minutes of hemming and hawwing around told me she was sorry but she had gotten so busy all of a sudden that she couldn't even come out for a month and a half. n nFelt like I was being lied too by an idiot. Sorry ""Cathy "" but you wasted my time and I think you lied to me. I recommend people skip tis company.",1
"I have heard good things about Papago from reviews online so while in Phoenix I decided to see how it could be rated higher than my local hole, The Falling Rock. I'm sorry and call me biased but the tap selection here is so weak I've seen more choices at yard house on the 16th street mall in denver. The bottle take out is a nice idea but the selection is meek at best. Not to mention i couldnt find anyone to help look for my beer that was seemingly not there. I haven't been to them all but while I'd give the falling rock in denver a 9.5 10 this place would barely reach a 5 and that just on selection alone. Sorry guys.",1
"Wanted Mexican food and have eaten at the one in Planet Hollywood and loved it. This one was not as good as the one in PH, but it was good.

Service was quick, ambiance was a little boring inside where we ate.",2
"Pasta bar you are killing me! n nGreat concept, poor execution. So much potential, the pasta itself is great, perfectly done and cooked but the sauces coming with it are all bad.

"Who doesn't love a good massage? I love this place, my husband and I have a membership and we only pay 80 a month, we both get a choice of an hour relaxation massage or facial.

"The decision on the DJ for our wedding was made the moment we met with Jeff from Ray the DJ. He is older for a man of his profession not a kid in his 20's that you'd expect to be working as a party event DJ but it didn't take long for him to win us over. The man is all charm and character. We could tell that he really loved music and what he does. I almost wanted to pull him out from behind the turntables, sit down, and have a few drinks with him. n nHe couldn't have been any better at the reception. He played everything we asked for, flowed perfectly with our timeline including working with us to finish some schmoozing before moving on to the next part , He could get our guest's attention but never tried to make himself the star of the show, and he knew how to keep the party going. The only negative thing I can say about Jeff was that he took an awful request from my new sister in law but in all fairness to him, she wanted to dance with her husband to their wedding song, so I can't blame him , but he quickly recovered as soon as the track ended. Probably with the exception of that song, people were on the dance floor until the final song.",2
" 15 for lunch AYCE bbq. One thing I didn't know was that all the meat and sides are buffet style so you have to serve yourself and bring the food back to the table. Some of the meat that we selected was tough the only thing that wasn't tough was the spicy pok short ribs. I enjoyed eating copious amounts of salad after a week long binge on junky foods but still, for 30 total I felt like we could've gotten better cuts of meat. n nAlso, they charge for leftovers here so make sure not to take too much meat when you first start cooking or else you'll be overwhelmed.",1
This place is a joke staffed by idiot power tripping pimple faced kids. I went into this store to buy a game for my son. It is rated M and they insisted that I show them my ID. I said that's not necessary as you can CLEARLY tell I'm over 18. I'm actually 40. They REFUSED to sell me the game unless they could power trip and look at my license. I told them they could stick the game up their ass and I would NEVER be back into the store or allow my son to step into another Gamestop. These idiot little power tripping fools guarantee this!,1
"This place was so disappointing. I was staying at the red rock resort for business and craving sushi. n nWe were seated right away but then it went downhill from there. The drink and app orders were taken right away. It then took at 15 minutes to receive the drinks. I had asked for warm saki, when she brought the drinks it was cold. It was then another 10 minutes for a new saki. n nWe ordered the LSD roll the only good roll we received , Cali roll meh , veggie tempura roll so greasy , and some roll with about 15 different things on it that just wasn't very good. n nThe waitress was rarely seen and took a long time to receive the the over inflated check. If you want good sushi, head somewhere else.",1
"Great hotel with a superb bar and restaurant Sushi Roku , but our stay was heavily tarnished by our experience of the pool. n nUnfortunately, the W has cashed in on the Vegas party pool idea and lets wannabes who aren't staying in the hotel turn up and reserve the loungers.

Uninspiring and lackluster thai chicken salad. Some of the ingredients such as the edame and red bell peppers were not fresh at all and tasted like they had a bit of freezer burn. This location is just a good place to meet a group of friends with a beverage and a scone.,1
A foodies wet dream! Over 500 items. And none are 'throwaway' items. Each seemingly prepared with full attention. Any of the items can easily be featured at a four star restaurant. So much too choose from. Worth the 50 plus especially when a lot of the other dining establishments cost a pretty penny and you don't get what you pay for. Definitely must be checked out on your next visit.,2
"I used to like Paradise Bakery a lot more than I do now. They've changed their menu a bunch, and while I appreciate a menu that isn't stagnant, I found myself just staring at their chalk boards unable to find something that sounded appealing. n nI ended up selecting their avocado Cobb salad and it came with like three chunks of avocado. My full size salad and a medium sized mediocre iced coffee drink ran me almost 15 after tax. n nNot impressed.",1
"open and heaving with university students and maybe some a bit younger or not so intellectually inclined on a monday night. throbbing breaky beats and cheap drinks. a bit on the druggy side. but hey, it's monday and they're open and poppin', so why not pop on in see if you like it?",1
"This place blew on every level of suckness. I ended up in this dump because of a welcome home party for someone I indirectly knew. First, the waitress was as dumb as rocks. She kept coming back telling us they were out of 9 10 beers on tap. 30 min later we got our room temperature pitcher. Secondly, I ordered cheese sticks then waited 45m for some steaming pile of crap. The cheese sticks were way over cooked with the cheese pouring every where and there was some strange black substance covering them. Thirdly, when our waitress finally came back and informed us of our tabs, she over charged all of us, and never brought back our change. Then continued to come around once in a while and try to convince us we needed to pay for our tabs. I was hoping this would be a chill place to hang out and play pool but instead it's the epitome of low rent. Stay away if you want to hang on to your cash.",1
"What a terrible place. My so called ""trainer "" could barely speak full sentences let alone english. He kept pushing pills on me and was very distracted by all of his ""gym rat friends "".

I have called numerous times to speak with him and he will not get on the phone or return the messages I have left. His receptionist staff have no clue what they are talking about and are very sketchy over the phone, it's ridiculous. The girl could not tell me they were going to try and charge me a fee to cancel I have had it because supposedly everyone's plans are different. n nDo not go here.

Ordered a taco and 2 tamales. The carne asada was slimey and the tamales were small. Won't eat here again.,1
"We search and search and search for good, inexpensive chinese food, and I think we have finally found it. So far, the food has been great. Not TERRIBLY impressed with the shrimp Mei Fun, but I think it's just because it wasn't what we were expecting. The Singapore Noodles are AMAZING, egg rolls are great, and they have the best hot and sour soup which has no meat of any of the local places around here. n nI understand the critics who say the food is bland because most places put so much cloying, thick, syrupy gook on all of the food, one can't experience the freshness of the vegetables, and the simplistic cooking style that should go into these dishes. They get it just right, in my book at this place. YUM. Will definitely go back.",2
"better get in line early at 9 and get a guest stamp. and come back later nplace is huge but dance floor is small relative to the club mosh pit on the floor. nplace needs a little better crowd control, cuz there are dudes everywhere. nalso there are some newb slow bartenders. which made me have to wait 45 minutes for 3 drinks. wtf?! ncockfest in the dance floor 45 minute wait for drink totally killed buzz ncrazy thing is that this place is going strong at 5 oclock morning",1
This is by far our fav in Vegas! Hubby melts for the chorizo stuffed lobster tail and the short rib entree. I had the Wellington. They were so good that when we came here again a year later we got the same things ! So good and the service is wonderful! Love it! Our Go to spot for Vegas vacation !,2
This place is perfect for a light lunch.price is not too bad either.,2
"Be Careful ! nWent Thursday Late afternoon nNice Atmosphere nOur Server was Angela nMy wife asked for a glass of house red wine nAngela said "" We don't have house wines "" nShe suggested the featured wine, nTo our surprise it was 15 for a very small glass nall the wines on the menu were 7 8 dollars nShe never mentioned ""the Drink special wines at 5 at glass available nWe got hustled nWe also had the Fritto Misto nTo call it Very Average is being generous nWE wisely didn't stay for Dinner",1
"Clean, friendly, great food. n nThe servers remember us, my favorite server calls us ""kids. "" Plus, they accommodate special orders! n nGet there for breakfast and Pasta Giovani for dinner.",2
"Food quality was below average. Adventure spicy is less than medium. I has Tom ka soup and beef pad Thai. Would not recommend. Also, employees were having a meeting on how to use the credit card machine and 2 were being reprimanded for incorrect usage. Not appropriate when customers in lobby.",1
"Briimstone is a small neighbourhood shop that's packed with chocolate goodies that are sure to please any chocolate lover. From homemade truffles and fudge, to chocolate bars and macarons, you would be hard pressed not to find something that you like. For all you fans of peanut butter Briimstone's PB cup seems to be quite elusive so you'd better call ahead to see if they have any in stock. Rumour has it that it's a highly sought after item and they have a hard time keeping it in stock. Sadly, there were none left for me, so I went with the next best thing a mini peanut butter fudge cupcake. I enjoyed this with my coffee this morning and found it to be a perfectly balanced blend of chocolate and peanut butter. I normally expect fudge to be overly sweet but in this case, it was simply perfect. My teeth didn't start screaming after the first bite, which is usually a good indicator of how sweet something is. I give it a 3 5 on the sweetness scale. n nI picked up a few random truffles as well n nRazzmatazz Dark chocolate raspberry The shell was nice and crunchy, and then all of a sudden, an explosion of sweet tartness that is beyond AH mazing. It was definitely more sour than what I'm used to but this is not a bad thing. This one's definitely got some zing to it! n nLime I found this to be underwhelming. You really don't taste the lime and the overall flavour was bland. n nOrange Same as the Lime. I also found this to be bland and have had a better experience with other chocolate brands such as Lindt, where you can really taste the citrus. n nPomegranate The shell was thick and had a good consistency. The taste of pomegranate was light and unassuming. I'm still debating on whether or not I would prefer a more powerful pomegranate taste or leave this one as is. Will have to try again! n nMate latte Awesome. You could really taste the coffee flavour that is consistent with a latte. n nAlmond spice something This was OK but I'm not a big fan of spice with my chocolate so I'm probably not the best to judge this one. I'm not sure what spice they used but it seemed to taste more than the chocolate did. n nOverall, I liked this shop, but I think I still prefer Suite 88. To be fair, they were low on stock when I went, so I think I'll have to go back and do some more taste testing ",2
"The casino looks a bit tired and rundown, but I was not there for that, I was there for a prime rib dinner. They advertised the special fore prime rib at 7.77, so I was not expecting much. But dang! I am no expert on high end steak, I am Cheep. so Moderate to low price, Black Angus is my style. and I have to say, this is one of the if not the best Prime ribs I have ever had. plus you get a bowl of fresh bread and two sides.What more could you ask for.",2
"It's had been some time since my last visit to Ping Pang Pong so I decided to give it a try for our pre holiday dim sum meal with friends. n nWe arrived around 1pm and the line was pretty long. We were seated by 1 30 at a table that was a little on the tight side for our party. n nDrinks and refills were plentiful, but the cart service was extremely disappointing. They were slow with the carts and despite us trying to flag them down, they were hard to catch and skipped us a few times which irked me and my friends. We eventually got their attention and got everything we had hoped for, but the bad attitude and service was annoying. n nThe food ranged for just ok to downright flavorless. Service issues aside, I can't think of a single dish that stood out to me as being good and I think I can safely cross Ping Pang Pong off my dim sum list from now on.",1
La salade de wakame est un incontournable! Tr u00e8s bon sushis et l'ambiance est super!,2
 1.50 TACOS! Yum! nThis place was recommended to us by a local. We asked where to get a good cheap taco and this place hit the nail on the head. n nTwo hippies are on the right track with this place. It's a bit small and it took about 20 min to get my food they were really busy but it was worth it. If I lived in Phoenix I would come here daily. n nA word about the fish tacos.they are good but seem as though they might use canned fish instead of fresh grilled chunks like most places. Considering the price this is acceptable! n nThe drinks and baked goods looked great though I haven't yet tried any. I'll save those for next time I'm in town.,2
"This place sucks. They don't have descriptions on their products and have unlisted ingredients. I ordered the cheese wontons, veggie spring rolls, and veggie chow mein. The cheese puffs aren't actually cheese puffs they are crab puffs. I am a vegetarian. I ordered cheese puffs, not crab puffs for this reason, so I could't eat them. Next is the veggie spring rolls, which have beef in them, again another item I couldn't eat. Lastly the chow mein, I have been eating chinese food my entire life and every time I have ever ordered chow mein it has been a stir fry noodle dish but here of course it is a little bag of fried wonton noodle things. And if all of that wasn't enough the fortune cookie tasted very strange almost like dirt. DO NOT EAT HERE!",1
Make yourself a reservation and have a pep talk with your wallet. This place is swanky. The drinks are a bit pricey for being off the strip. While sitting at the bar awaiting a table we ordered two drinks. Once our table was ready 20 minute wait we got our bill for the bar and 30 later we were being seated. They bring you a bread basket so try not to get too full off of carbs before your meals come. As other reviews have said.order the lobster mac n cheese. Delicious! It's a great opener to your meal. I ordered the duck and my gf ordered the prime rib as a side we ordered mashed potatoes. Yummy! To close out our meal we ordered the creme brulee. What a delectable surprise. Either way a great meal and a must revisit.,2
"Made the drive and went in this past weekend and it was the same as I remembered it. Divine. Still my 1 pick for sushi in Las Vegas. n nThe Age Nasu is a really good fried tofu in a broth only 2! nOne of my favorite rolls is the GTR roll, the gyoza is good, the soft shell crab salad and the poke salads are both yummy, we had an entire plate of just sushi sashimi it was buttery, fresh and deelish. n nMy favorite nigiri is the garlic tuna and hamachi. n nThey also have a nice selection of sake. n nI've had sushi in San Francisco and New York and this place is just is as good as sushi in these two culinary monster cities. Absolutely fantastic.",2
I have been here a few times and I will continue to go because it is close to my work and I love gyro's. The gyro's are good big full of meat the fries are to thick for my taste and the soda is way to small for the price of the combo. Overall I am a fan but I think they can improve in some areas.,2
"My husband and I visited this bar based on BeerAdvocate reviews. We were here on a Tuesday night. We sat at the bar since we were just there for drinks. The beers each of us had were decent, nothing to write home about. I can't tell you if there were better offerings as we proceeded to sit there with empty glasses as 5 employees stood 10 feet away from us behind the bar having a conversation completely ignoring customers Note one of them was the person prepping the food and she was also busy stuffing her face with her bare hands from the sandwich ingredient tubs yum . We're not people who are going to shout someone down for service, so we decided to just call it at this place. We finally had someone ask if we needed anything else and just got the check. The service here is horrible, the beers were average. Overrated.",1
"We went to CPK and it was terrible, our server was in our face the whole time. It was as if she was trying to rush us out and there was no wait for tables. Then, we had another server running the floor vacuum around our table and under our table, hitting our feet. I hate when restaurants allow this practice. It is discussing and intrusive with little regard for your customers! The food was cold and flavorless. I will never return to this restaurant. avoid it's a waste of your .",1
"I love the space here. I took a bunch of photos in fact, but they disappeared off of my iPhone. Lame. nIt's like being in an underwater jellyfish cherry blossom garden in the main dining area, and like being in a glass of champagne in the bar. nWe sat in a private area in the back with the low tables and cushions on the floor. Clever designers left plenty of leg room hidden under the table, so instead of sitting on the ground which is what it looks like you'll be doing at first, you actually slip down and sit as you regularly would at a table. It's a bear to get back out though, especially if you were say, tipsy, wearing a skirt, or elderly. Or all three. nThe food was decent, I think I was actually more impressed with the non sushi offerings than the sushi itself, but it was fresh and tasty. Service was a bit slow, but we were a large group that came in without a reservation, so maybe our server was slammed with other tables? nI'd recommend it the space is lovely and the food pretty damn good.",2
"The secret to some good shopping at UO is to make a trip to a store like the big one on Mill Ave. , try on the clothes, check the size that fits you, examine the material, colour and the accessories, come back home and order over the internet. n nAll too often there is a substantial difference between the marked price of their store merchandise and the list price on their website. And this was mentioned by their own staff. n nThere are just too many things in the store that you'd like to own so it is good to know the best way of going about the purchase.",2
Had this today for the very first time. We had chocolate and wedding cake WONDERFUL! My whole family liked it. We are going to have to track them down for more in the future.,2
"We have had this warranty service for more than 8 years but have probably had less than a dozen calls over that period. In the last year we had a minor electrical problem. The GFI switch in our garage, which was on the same circuit as our upstairs bathroom tripped, repeatedly. After 2 or 3 unsuccessful repair calls 55.00 each, we had given up, BUT then we thought we'd try one more time since we were tired of going down the stairs and out to the garage each night at least once to reset the GFI. The electrician came and replaced the outlet AGAIN, but this time with a different brand. The same brand as the home had originally. The problem was solved. Apparently they had been using an inferior grade product. If it that was that difficult for a small problem, I wonder what it would be like if we had had a major need?",1
"Didn't make it past the host stand. Extremely condescending hosts dictated to us that each member of the party needed to agree to ordering an entree before our name would be added to the list. In addition we were told that the entire party needed to be present when our table was ready to be seated. When I jokingly mentioned there was significant criteria to dine here, the hostess quickly and condescendingly encouraged me to eat at McDonald's. No chance in hell I'll spend a dollar here. 8 15pm on 10 8",1
"I too purchased an Amazon Local coupon. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER. Dan told me it would take 45 minutes for a small coupe. I WAS THERE FOR 2 HOURS. Time2Tint isn't even an established business, it's joined with some other jank auto parts place. He returned my car to me beyond dirty, water stains on the outside and inside of my car and the back window isn't done right! Seriously, you have me there for two hours and can't get it right. I don't even want to take it back to get it fixed! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR TINTING! Complete waste!",1
"Driver had a really bad attitude. The apartment number was wrong and she asked ""Sooo did you just enter it wrong or what? "" Then she kept me on the phone without talking while she trudged over to my apartment. I apologized for the mix up and she said nothing. The most interaction she had with me at the door, was to ask if this was my credit card? I still tipped her because I've been a server before, but thinking back maybe I should not have. I would never have been so rude to a customer. The pizza tasted pretty good, but I already had a bad taste in my mouth. Next time I will order from Papa John's or one of the 10 other pizza places near ASU.",1
"Very cool, modern feel to this restaurant and bar. The view from the patio is outstanding as many others have noted. n nI found the service at the bar to be at bit slow, particularly since they weren't that busy at the time I was there and two bartenders were working. n nBut if you have a chance to go, definitely do it, you'll enjoy the view if nothing else.",2
Famous Uncle Al's hot dogs and Grill is one great hot dog place! We made sure we had one more hot dog before going home. I highly recommend them if you are looking for a great hot dog.,2
OMG never had such a shitty burger bbq ranch burger threw up in my mouth always have loved mcdonalds 4 5 stars but have to review that shit literally would probably eat shit than eat the bbq ranch burger!,1
"This is my 3rd visit here. It is our favorite Sunday breakfast spot! It's a tiny corner cafe in a strip mall. Pretty nondescript these are usually the best places . Seats about 40 people inside and 12 on the patio. Skipping to the good stuff, the food! I've not had anything here I didn't like! The pancakes are the size of hub caps, coffee is bottomless, service is very friendly and accommodating! If you like eggs Benedict, I highly recommend the French! It has prosciutto ham over a fresh croissant, topped with hollandaise sauce. Ask for the spicy hollandaise to give it an extra bit of a kick If you like scrambles skillets get the kielbasa scramble. Get there early, there is usually a wait by 11am!",2
"I was very disappointed by my visit here. I stood up front, waiting to be seated for about 5 minutes. The employees made eye contact with me on several occasions and made no indication that I was able to seat myself and or were about to assist me. I am a big fan of Korean food, but an even bigger advocate of good customer service. I am unable to provide a rating for the food, as I eventually walked out.",1
"I had about an hour to spare between early morning flights at Skyharbor and so decided to try out a new place. n nI ordered the turkey sausage sliders as I hadn't seen those on a menu before. n nI think everything is cooked fresh and so it took a few minutes to prepare which was fine for me, but if you have to catch a flight that might not be great . n nThe bread buns were nice a light fluffy perhaps like brioche the turkey sausage was kind of flavourless, the egg ""pancake "" was terrible, like microwaved frozen eggs terrible I honestly thought it was a pancake at first until I looked at the menu again. There was some cheese present, but it had no taste. n nI added both the salsa they give you and some sriracha I asked for, but nothing could save the sliders. n nThere was a side of fried potatoes papas but they were very small pieces and had been overcooked. n nBased on this meal I would not eat here again.",1
You are not allowed to use the wireless. Thats pretty sad. But they do have diet coke,1
"The sushi pieces just keep getting bigger and bigger. And that salmon wow, where do they get such tender salmon! n nThey keep changing the frequent diner program so often I can't keep track. But I can't hold that against them, they have such good sushi, and in bountiful proportions!",2
This review is for dine in service. Take out service would have gotten 5 stars for sure. n nThe food is good. Everything is fresh and taste really good. The service is not so good. Staff sitting down watching the tv's while you are eating is kinda trashy. If you need more tea or water you have to get their attention and wave them down in order to get refills. That is the only part that i didnt like. n nWould I Come Back in.For Take Out No problem would i Dine in.Problably not.,2
"The restaurant is now just ""Fleur "". no longer Fleur de Lys, located inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Fleur means flower in French, but the decor seems to be reminiscent of rustic modern, something you can find in Colorado or Minnesota. the only ""flower "" i see at the entire place is the cut orchids placed in a glass container. n nInstead of indulging in a huge steak dinner, H and i decided to give this place a try for their sampling menu. As crazy as it sounds, but they offer a tasting menu called the ""feast "" that's meant to serve min of 6 people for 450, but large parties of 10 people have proclaimed that they cannot finish this on their own. n nMINI BITES nthe AHI TACOS 14 were amazing! the jalapeno on top gives it a spicy kick and the ahi was seasoned perfectly. n nSHORT RIBS 26 nah, the price tag was a bit steep considering the size, but well worth it. braised for many hours, it was so soft and juicy and oozing with flavor. my fav dish of the night. n nNAMPOL'S WINGS 9 nnot too novel in taste or presentation, but tasty indeed. n nCEVICHE 14 nnot your typical shrimp ceviche. i tasted oysters sitting atop a bed of guacamole. the chips were fried perfectly and had a crunchy crisp. n nMIXED GREEN SALAD 10 of course you need to fulfill that recommended serving of veggies for the day. n nALMOND PANNA COTTA dessert 10 nalmond cake with blackberry kalamansi sorbet. this dish was not too sweet for a dessert. it actually was a bit tart, which was a perfect complement to my sweet cocktails. n nLIBATIONS nFLEUR RED SANGRIA carafe is 35 nwow, really one of the best sangria H and I ever had. made from Malbec and Brandy infused with fresh fruits and spice. it really creeps up on you, too. n nDECADENT FLIGHT 18 for trio of 3 cocktails nwhite chocolate, chocolate coconut, and expresso martini. nReally tastes like a dessert, a little bit sweet, but the presentation was gorgeous. my fav of the 3 was the white chocolate. however, i would order this again just bc i love the diversity of flavors. after all, this is a ""tasting menu "" type of establishment, isn't it? n nSERVICE nwas questionable at first, but when we requested a new server, the night turned out ten times better! n none of the best dining experiences of our entire trip. highly recommend!",2
Margarets has been a favorite of mine for years. n nThey have a large variety of packaged and loose leaf teas as well as coffee beans for every taste. Margaret and her staff are always right on with their advice. n nI have shopped there for years and I have always walked away happy with both the service and products.,2
"It was really good comfort food, everything incorporated with foie gras which I am a huge fan of, the cranberry goat cheese foie gras and the foie gras poutine is a must order. The duck appetizer was very good as well.",2
"Was visting Vegas and wanted real Mexican food which is really hard to find in Hawaii. The reviews that this place was featured on dirty dines did not deter me I was going to eat real Mexican food. I had the burrito enchilada combo and it was 100 amazing. There was so much food that I had it as a second lunch on the plane a few hours later. I wish I had access to cheap, good Mexican food!",2
"A very lovely cheese and souvenir shop. I was very lucky to come across this shop while walking around downtown. They are very helpful, and let me know that the cheese could travel home to LA in my carry on without any ice. So I got to take cheese home to my friend and myself instead of the ""Cow Tipping "" T shirt I had seen at the airport. They get a star for supporting Family Farmers.",2
"I love this Lee's! I remember the day I drove by the vacant plaza and saw a sign that said Lee's Discount Liquor Coming Soon! Well it didn't come soon enough. I think it took about a year for them t finally open their doors. n nWhen they finally did open, It didn't take long for me to become a regular. I could walk here if i needed but that might turn into a problem! n nThey staff is always friendly and helpful. They have even offered to help try and get some of my hometown items in stock. But I know that Utica Club beer isn't gonna be a hot seller in this town! n n nI love that they always have tastings, special deals offers. I always get suckered into trying some new type of drink, but I can always count on them to have my staples.",2
amazing view!,2
This is the best pizza in Las Vegas. I love the staff too. Very friendly and always great service.,2
The Mesa location doesn't have quite the quaint charm of the Tempe location but the food is still great and the patio is ample. All the pasties on the menu are very good and the traditional ones do stay very true to the Old Country recipes. The dessert pasties are worth a try if you have room. I also enjoy picking up the ones you can finish baking at home. Drink prices are always good and they normally have specials going. My favourite is the Shepherd's Pie or the Bangers and Mash. Ask for extra red wine gravy.,2
Sad experience. Went to the drive in at 10pm and was told they could not fill an order of their 10 for 10.99. They only had 3 pieces of chicken. That's not enough to feed both people in the car so we just left. The employee made it pretty clear he wouldn't make more.,1
"My best friend and I love Big Heng. The staff knows our regular order, they are always fast and the prices are cheap. I recommend lunch over dinner since the prices are cheaper and portions still the same. I love the chicken teryaki and crab puffs are the best!",2
"Comparable to Roscoe's Chicken Waffles in Southern California, Lo Lo's is pretty good! n nOpen late with no long waits to be seated especially with a big group, Lo Lo's is a place to visit in Arizona for some good chicken and waffles. Portions are good, but if you have a big appetite, then order 2. I thought it was cool that they served their drinks in jars. An extra plus for me was that they served Mountain Dew Code Red, and I thought that drink didn't exist in fountain drink options, so totally loved that!",2
This club is beautiful! The music. Not the best. We went when EDX was there and the light show was fun but the music wasn't popping enough for us to all dance. n nThe hip hop floor was uber crowded. I felt like I was in front of the crowd at Lollapalooza! There wasn't enough room to dance. There was also another room that was more like a classy dive bar. I walked in when the DJ was mashing up a Johnny Cash song which was neat. n nKeep in mind that there are a LOT of stairs. A LOT. You will want to die in your heels especially with all the walking you already did on the strip .,2
"If 5 star was an option this place would definitely deserve it. We went here to presentation sometime ago, since then we have been fighting them. The time that they sell is completely worthless. Even at 10,000 points w some incredible stroke of luck, you may get what you want. It seems for any use of the timeshare requires you pay 200. That may not seem like alot but when you already paid 6800, it is. n nPS You CAN'T use Cosmo unless your staying there. Liars! n nAs an example for how worthless this place is I went on a vacation to Hawaii, I got a better price paying out of pocket to a travel agent then to pay them additional few hundred . n nI think I am going to give it back to them and write off my taxes as a investment lost, because it is a complete waste of and the government can go to them for the taxes.",1
"Loved the Sushi, we also had Amy as our waitress knowing negative views of her on previous posts and she was 100 perfectly fine, sweet, patient and knowledgeable. She went out of her way to explain details, helped us ms make a few decisions and we are picky foody people. Zero complaints about Amy and honestly this place gets busy. And she still tended to us in a very professional and personal fashion. Sushi was very good and the rolls were huge and tasted wonderful. We had the Las Vegas roll, Mexican roll our new favorite , and the Casey roll which is very awesome too . This is a great North Phoenix place and I would recommend it highly if you like sushi and a good waitresses meaning Amy. And no, I don't know her personally at all . Great sushi! Thanks",2
"I absolutely love Pei Wei, but this location's food does not live up to the quality of other ones. The rice was mushy, the honey seared chicken was soggy and bland, the Thai dynamite chicken tasted like nothing but a hint of lime, and the crab puffs were just weird. These are all the normal things I order and always love, but not from this one.",1
"This is one of my favorite places to go to! It's a great place, so it's always crowded, even with reservations, you'll have to wait a little. n nAll the dishes are great, the waiters and bartenders are very customer oriented, but the hostesses are OK. They forget they are the first ones customers see when we walk in and they have to finish their conversations before accommodating us. Hence the 4 stars. n nThis place is perfect for dates, intimate ones, and also groups girls' night, birthdays, etc any kind of celebration The vibe makes you really happy yet relaxed but never sleepy n nThey need to open up a few more!",2
"Reading the other reviews of this Massage Envy, I am a bit surprised. I have had nothing but pleasant experiences which led me to become a member. The front desk staff is very nice and cheery and willing to help in any way. I have been seeing Patty for a year or more now once per month , and she has always asked me what areas to focus on and then completely focused on that area. n nI would definitely recommend this location for someone looking for a massage.",2
"We went during the transition between breakfast and lunch even though lunch started at 10 30 and we were there at 11 they still had breakfast items out . The biscuits were hard as a rock, the gravy had the consistency of water, and almost everything there was cold. The selection was poor at best. We would have been much happier spending a fraction of the money and eating at McDonald's.",1
"Food is great, however, when you order delivery from an establishment you would think it wouldn't take an hour and fifteen minutes to make one sandwich and drive it, quite literally five minutes away from said establishment.I understand there is a lunch rush especially on a Saturday, but taking that long for ONE sandwich is ridiculous, now I am reminded to never order lunch from here because I won't be able to ever eat on my lunch break unless I plan it out! Also the sandwich and fries weren't ""fresh "" probably were made and was sitting on a counter somewhere I'm not picky so to me it tasted fine, but I'm sure others would be upset that it was warm and freshly made especially after such a long wait",1
This place is great. A nice central location. Super clean and organized. Friendly and knowledgable staff. And a really good varied selection. Everything you could ask for or need from a great comic book store.,2
"Located this restaurant within easy walking distance of our hotel, the Embassy Suites. I had an excellent Veal Parmagiana with a side of spaghetti with Bolognese sauce, and my wife had an equally excellent canneloni with meat sauce. The sauces in particular were flavorful, and the meat and pastas also well prepared. The service was attentive. n nI'm docking this restaurant one star for atmosphere on a Saturday night.specifically, there was a singer who was very good, by the way whose mic was way too loud, making it virtually impossible to have a quiet conversation due to EVERYONE in the restaurant raising their voices to talk over the singer's mic. A shame that this situation was so noticeable that it requires this specific criticism, affecting an otherwise lovely meal. n nI would certainly recommend this place on a night without the entertainment.",2
Not impressed at all. I had to keep my car another week because my father passed away. I called to extend and told them why I had to extend. No note was made and I paid over 500 for 12 days. Should have been 400. nYou will take TWO busses from the Vegas airport to get the car.not worth it . nDriver from fox was very slow. Too frekin slow.,1
"Oh Ann why did it take this long for you to come into my life?! I was told about Phoenix Glow by a friend and thought nothing of it. Fast forward to the best spray tan of my life, good bye spray tan booths! Ann is amazing at making you feel comfortable and knowing exactly what would look good for your skin. Never have I had so many compliments on my tan, I cannot wait to come back! n nThanks Ann!",2
"It wasn't a bad place to stay, it was comfortable. But I won't stay here again. We stayed in a two queen bed room and one of the beds was broken falling off the box spring so we called down to let them know, so we would not be responsible for it. They said someone would be up to fix it. When we came back hours later, the bed looked like it had been moved but not fixed. So the next day we went down stairs to the desk to ask about it, and she said she would put in an order to have it looked at while we were gone for the day. We came back again hours later, and it was STILL broken! The bed was leaning so bad I took pictures to show management, but they don't have a ""contact us "" on there website. Horrible! Just imagine if someone got hurt. That's a huge law suite waiting to happen!",1
"Used to go to Charlie Miller years ago and, although it was expensive, I felt it was worth the money. Been struggling with my hair recently and decided to treat myself by returning to Charlie Miller. Persevered with Lorraine for almost a year at u00a359 for a cut and blow dry , at the end of which I've given up and moved elsewhere. After around five cuts, I felt my hair was no where nearer to where I wanted it to be than when I started out. I felt Lorraine spoke a lot and didn't really pay close attention to what she was doing. I also felt that she didn't take care to finish off my hair, and each time I left the salon, I couldn't wait to get home to re style my hair which might have been acceptable if I'd been able to re style it successfully, but unfortunately, it never felt right , I'm sorry, but I feel Charlie Miller has lost its edge and is over charging for a mediocre service.",1
"So disappointed! nWent to this place for lunch nd felt so uncomfortable. I asked to be seated at the bar bc I was alone nd pregnant, so I thought it was good to see how they handle the food beside I expected it to be fun nd fast. I did all u can eat. Waited 30min for my app gyoza. The chefs never said hi or even looked at my direction with care or happiness. ""I have been always greeted at a bar sushi bar "", it is the least they can do. One of the chef made a silly comment as soon as I arrived at the bar, after that I knew I was at the wrong place. From 4 different kind of rolls I would only came back for 1 maniac roll it was the only one spice with no sweet sauce or fake crabmeat. Everything else was just blah blah blah. The service was polite but slow nd confused. I never had a refill on my water. Their management sushi chef seems like to kiss the good looking well dressed ppl ass. Everyone else were mistreated including myself. This was the worse place I have ever been. I would never come back here once I won't put my best clothes just to someone treat me with respect. Besides for 1 single good roll? Forget it. I would prefer to drive to 808 sushi that' is not fancy but better quality sushi and a way better service. . The first roll I had was the monster every single piece of it fell apart when trying to eat it. every single roll were ugly and tasteless except for the super sweet sauce and super sweet crabmeat combination they put on everything. nMy experience at this place lasted around 1 1 2hour bc it would take between 25 35 min for every order. Plus 20min for the check. In the end I can say The only good thing about this place is that you can do half order. That's all.",1
"Ordered food to go on Sunday 2 16 14. We got the stuffed chicken which was ok. The spicy basil with ground chicken was delicious, spice level at 4 was just enough heat! Also got chicken satay and green curry at a spice level of 2, both very good as well. The gentleman who helped me was very nice and patient, I wasn't sure about the menu. I would like to come back to try out more items off their menu",2
"The food was totally gross! We had a bad experience at the one in University and decided to try again with this one, it was still disgusting. Bathrooms were disgusting too.",1
I won a certificate for the Sheraton Charlotte at a charity silent auction. I called the 800 number and was told they had plenty of rooms available. I was then directed to use my certificate by calling the Charlotte location. The Charlotte front desk refused to take my certificate even though my day is not on the black out list. I was told the hotel was totally booked! I called the 800 number again and was told there were plenty of rooms available. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She back tracked and told me since the room rate had gone up to 409 they would not honor their gift certificate until the rates were lower! I was also told the hotel is undergoing construction at this time even with the high rates! I would give zero stars if allowed. Doesn't seem like such a great certificate to win now.,1
"Who doesn't like butter?!?! Right? nThis place is absolutely amazing! I've been here numerous times and I always leave feeling completely endulged and the satisfaction of doing work! n nYou have to be willing to work for every bite, but boy oh boy is every bite worth it. I usually get the snow crab or the shrimp with the lemon seasoning. n nI always have to get my area situated and ready before the beautiful sight of bags full of butter and critters! It is messy so don't plan on wearing your cute outfit for the night! Although you do get a classy bib to wear. n nAlso, be aware that you could possibly smell like butter for awhile. nBut despite the lingering smell, this is a MUST HAVE MUST GO! nThe service is great and the food is even better!",2
"This review is for the cafe in the casino. I have lived in LV for 11 years have never been treated so terribly . nCame to get some food after walking around Fremont East. We found HAIR in 2 out of 4 plates of food ! Ewwwwww! nWe complained to a manager were told that 'MOST' of the cooks wear hairnets! 'MOST?!?! Well obviously that is not good enough! We got a total attitude from her when all we did was address the issue ! Hello we wanted to eat! nNeedless to say after this experience I would never ever go back ! We tipped the waiter 20 and left . I plan on contacting the food beverage manager in the morning. nThis is completely unacceptable to one not only find hair, but to get a complete attitude is so unprofessional . I will make sure to not only let ever local I know never to go there again , but any out of towners also. I would give negative stars if I could!",1
"I went to Bravo Bistro last night to attend a Yelp Recruiting Mixer and it was a great experience! I was only there for a few hours and had a couple pita chips with humus and a few beers which were on the house! and the service was amazing. Any time my drink was gone a server was right there to get me another one, and on two occasions the owner Tony came up to take my drinks. n nTony and I actually had a long conversation on the patio about his restaurant and the spot he does on 3TV. He is an extremely down to earth and intelligent guy who really is passionate about his business! I look forward to coming here again and again!",2
"When we moved to Colorado from Phoenix we weren't able to make a house hunting trip beforehand. Therefore, I had to rely on the Internet to find a place to live. Through MEB Management Services, we rented a brand new townhouse sight unseen. It was such a great convenience and we were all set to move in the minute we made it to town. You can also use MEB Management Services when making local moves. It's just so convenient to have rental options all in one place and someone to help you make your decision. It costs nothing to the renter.",2
"The Sunday brunch is disappointing! They don't have crab legs or lamb! Everything pretty much tasteless. Definitely not coming back here. Eggs Benedict eggs are not cooked all the way. See in picture. The egg whites are not cooked. Soggy waffles, hard french toast, weak coffee, and staff acted like we were bothering them when asking for more drinks.",1
"Ok so this is a glorified airport Chili's so I had low expectations to start with. My margarita is pretty good, but expensive. I wish I could tell you about the food. Fact of the matter is, I've been here for almost an hour now. No sign of my burrito. Aren't most people here in a hurry? n nThis is going to need to be one delicious burrito. Too slow service for an airport. I should have walked the mile to the Moe's in the A gates. Lesson learned. n nAvoid.",1
"We chose this restaurant for my mother's 80th birthday dinner. Located in the Wynn Hotel Casino this restaurant was beautiful, the staff gracious and the food absolutely delicious. n nThey sat us at a table with a 'front row' view of their 95 foot waterfall. The table was room meaning we weren't bumping elbows and the chairs were comfy. n nWe ordered the Okada Roll Maine lobster, asparagus, avocado wrapped in soy paper, sushi special toro, tuna, salmon, yellowtail albacore, sushi roll special toro, tuna, yellowtail, salmon, albacore, shrimp spicy tuna roll, soba, udon, beef teriyaki and some other things that I forget there were 8 of us . Everything was outstanding and I recommend the Okada Roll. I'm iffy about lobster and I adores this roll, the lobster was firm and went well with the asparagus avocado. At 38, I recommend this as an appetizer for the table. The sushi was very fresh, my favorite of the evening was the yellowtail. I got a bite of soba, perfectly al dente in a yummy broth. The teriyaki was juicy, tender sirloin in one of the best teriyaki sauces I've had. n nAfter dinner, the server presented my mother with a gorgeous dessert platter. A little bit of everything from sweet bean filled mochi, bite sized cakes to green tea ice cream. Happy Birthday Yuki was written on the platter with chocolate syrup. n nThe bill came out around 500 including tip, for 8 people . Not bad considering we had cocktails wine. What an awesome experience!",2
"Bypassed another BBQ spot to try this one. The reviews were ""spot on "". We happen to like vinegar based BBQ and this was delicious. The tiny bit of sauce served with the BBQ was OK , but sweet. I do wish they had offered a larger container of it on the tables. Surprised about the Texas Toast, thought it was on the side it was the sandwich. Parking out front indicates a one hour maximum you won't have a problem getting in out in that amount of time. We will be back!",2
"Stayed at the Luxor Pyramids the other month and not a fan from my experience. My group booked two suites to stay in for the few days we were venturing into Vegas. n nThe BLEH MEH n nWhen my friend booked our rooms, the description said there would be two queen beds and a pullaway bed on the couch. LIES There were two full size beds and the couch definitely did not pull out. Also, the website and front desk made it seem as if the Tower suites only have king size beds. We found out later that there are indeed queen size beds in the Tower suites. sigh. n nThe casino was just meh to me. The dealers on the tables we played weren't very enthusiastic or anything. Thankfully, the Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay, either through the tram or the Shoppes at Mandalay. I definitely preferred the casino and dealers over there. n nLocation wise, it's located kind of far from the main strip where all of the popular clubs are. But we managed with taxis and limos. n nOMG THE ELEVATORS ARE CRAY IF YOU STAY IN THE PYRAMID. THEY MOVE SLANTED UP AND DOWN! Be prepared for motion sickness by elevator motion. Definitely not good when you have a good buzz going on. merrrr n nThe YAY OH HAY n n24 Hour McDonalds IN the hotel?! CHECK! We definitely made several trips here at ungodly hours when we stayed here. n nConvenient tram to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. n nFree self parking and valet! Which is standard for most hotels I believe? But you just tip the valets so holllller. n nCheap. Can't complain about the price honestly. n nThat's it. Bye bye Luxor. We may or may not meet again. Probably the latter. X",1
It was a good 10 for Lunch. Seafood is good here as well as the fruits and deserts.the hibachi station is worth trying. But I'm not excited about it,1
"I really wanted to like Bonterra. I really REALLY wanted to enjoy it.but it was just disappointing. My husband and I ordered a variety of items off the menu an array of appetizers, entrees and wine and nothing really ""wowed "" us. The worst part of it all, though, was the service. Maybe the server was just having an off night, but he was very short with us, only checked on us twice during the entire time once was to greet and the second was to drop off the check with no thank you whatsoever . Other servers dropped off our food which is completely fine .but the whole experience was a let down. When you spend that kind of money on a meal 200 you really want to be taken care of and it seemed like no one cared at all.",1
"I received old, cold and bad tasting fries. The bun was as hard as a rock. This was not my only bad experience at this location, but it will be my last. What a waste of my money. I did not get a response to my complaint. They would have only replaced my meal and it probably would have been just as bad. So many better options out there. Avoid this location at all costs. Would have given 0 stars if possible.",1
"My husband and I stopped by for dinner tonight. We ordered an appetizer platter don't remember the name because it was Italian but it was the most expensive appetizer 19 this appetizer alone is the reason I gave them two stars instead of one. I ordered the orechiette with Italian sausage and broccoli rabe. I first noticed that my dish was swimming in olive oil about one inch deep. Forked up some pasta dripping with olive oil, took a bite, tasted like I bit into pure salt.thought maybe it's just salty and not mixed well enough. Mixed tried a broccoli rabe, again salty. I'm the type of person that will try and not complain about my food and I have never sent food back. However the manager at that moment I think he's the manager because he was dressed in a suit and greeting tables stopped by and asked how everything was and I just whispered it's a little salty. THe manager gave me a look I felt very bad and without a word took my plate and went to the kitchen. I was very uncomfortable because I felt terrible but the dish was inedible. A few minutes passed and the manager came and said we'll get you a new dish which was very kind but I was still uncomfortable because I could tell by the look of his face he was upset. Anyways got my dish and noticed now that there was absolutely no salt. But I will say I'd rather have it that way. All in all I ended up taking a couple bites and that's about it. My husband had spaghetti with meatballs and again heavy salt with the meatballs but at least his pasta was fine. As for the appetizer, I guess the reason it was good was because there really wasn't any cooking involved. Basically it was prosciutto, olives, garlic, and another meat of some sort. . I will not go back again because I don't think paying someone 60 to fill me with salt is worth it.",1
"Went for dinner last night and was very impressed with the ambiance, food and service. We were well taken care of by the wait staff and the chef owner even came out to discuss the food with us. The Gnocchi with Tomato Jam was amazing. Our entrees were equally as fantastic. nI've seen a number of reviews here about portion size of food. Listen folks if you want huge portions of food on the cheap go to Applebee's. This isn't about how much food you can fit on a plate for under 10. This is a dining experience with seasonal local food on an evolving menu. n nLooking forward to going back and would recommend it to others!",2
This place is untrained. How can you tell me the min you bring out a phone that you are already taking a loss on it before we even talk price horrible selling skills. Then under allowing on our trade in seems like we need to make a true phone. Helping you find the right phone for the right price. We walked in and ask for someone in sales then after waiting for a few min I hunt down a sales guy who proceeded to tell me how I'm wrong about a phone. This is a green pea mistake. This place is got to change.,1
"The only thing that must keep this place alive is a great outdoor patio and good location. The service is awful, as in it's painfully obvious the management has no commitment to serving the customer. Sat down on a less than busy Sunday evening, and waited 15 minutes before drink orders were taken. After emptying the first glass the food arrived, and the drinks were not refilled until 3 4 of the way through the meal. What server doesn't check in on drinks, especially when the food arrives? I also had to go to the bar to get my silverware. The food is at the lower end of the spectrum on quality, considering the multitude of options. n nI was angry when I paid the bill, and wish I had picked someplace else. With a lot of options, this place is a no go. Take Filberto's to the park, and the squirrels will likely service you better. Win win. n nPlus, don't order an extra basket of chips, that will cost you. WTF.",1
"Awesome time with the family. I mean the tequilla didn't hurt, but it was good food, good music and live entertainment. Mt three boys loved the dancing betty in a swimsuit. Kinda pricey though.",2
"Yummy teriyaki. If you like garlic, this is your place to try. Their shrimp tempura is tasty!",2
"You never know when you're going to need an ounce of Dutch Cocoa is a rule you should live by. They have everything you would ever need to fill up that rack you got for a wedding gift from Aunt Sara. n nThey have everything from whole or ground spices to custom seasoning blends. They have ""tasters "" or ""Smellers "" for the various spices. The vanilla smellers were my favorite. The staff was uber knowledgeable in the intricacies of each item in the store and were very helpful when asked questions or to help you navigate your way around the store. n nSavory Spice Shop is a place you should visit and support.",2
"Love their Salty Senoritas aka Cadillac margaritas! Lovely patio, great ambience, good service from the bartenders will be definitely back to try the ceviche and guac!",2
"One very, very blurry night a few months ago, I was showing an out of town friend around the Strip. He wanted to go to a buffet in a bad way. We were right by Harrah's, so against my better judgement, that's where we ended up. Let's just say 22 a head was outragious for what was offered. n nFirst, I was hungry. Second, I wasn't expecting much, but thought I could eat just about everything. Nothing looked appetizing to me, even through my beer goggles. Everything looked old, the place was kind of depressing. I wouldn't think anyone would really consider ending up here, but if for some reason you are please think again. There are better, cheaper buffets in town, I promise.",1
Server and food was very great. Everything was nice except the hostess was not very friendly. Made me not want to eat there at all at least in my opinion .,1
The girls that work at Fahrenheit Tanning are so helpful and sweet! Ive been coming here for a long time on and off and have always got great service!,2
"I came here back when Yelp had Naka at 4.5 stars and I must say that I was extremely disappointed. The nigiri had too much rice and the rolls weren't that great. Not to mention there was only one server waiter taking care of all the tables. Since I don't want to be a total downer I will say that the quality of fish wasn't bad. n nThere are many better ayce sushi places in Vegas, don't waste your time and money coming here!",1
"So maybe 1 star is a little harsh, and only for the casino, But I didn't see a single thing here that would make me want to come back, much less even stay here. The casino was fairly small, and the ventilation was pretty poor compared to the other casinos on the strip which is also why I avoid Fremont st . n nThe dealers were in normal Hooters garb, nothing too exciting. A couple friends took advantage of the single deck black jack table and were all in a pretty sour mood by the time they were done. The dealer had these ridiculous specific rules to follow, from how to hit can only do it with you cards to how you're supposed to tap the table, to not allowing you to really talk with other people at the table. n nREALLY NOW? n nNot worth it. The vibe was oppressing and the dealers were irritating. Definitely won't waste my time coming back here my next time in Vegas.",1
"I always play pool at Mickey's, but I decided to give this place a shot. When I walked in, the owner came up to me and said, in a very mobster way, ""ok you guys can play here, but two rules. Keep the noise down, and pull your pants up "". I was offended. I don't sag my pants at all. I'm a 27 year old man, not a hipster. Never coming back again. This place is too uptight, and that pompus owner killed it for me. Always looking at us.",1
"We'd been looking for a good sushi bar for a long time real sushi not just rolls , fresh and tasty sashimi, served by a chef that knows what he's doing and interacts with the customers. You get all of that at Hokaido. n nJJ and Eric provide fantastic service and are a ton of fun to eat with. The presentation of every dish is top notch and the prices are good. This has become our regular spot.",2
"I was very surprised by my visit tonight. This was not my first visit to BJ's. At our table of seven chairs, 4 of them were broken. This is a huge accident waiting to happen. We started out our meal with the calamari appetizer. This was very good. No issues there. Then with the meal, I ordered the margarita flat bread. I have ordered this before and loved it. Tonight was not the same. I think it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile before it was brought to the table. The last time I remember that it had more fresh basil on it, too. This time the basil didn't even cover the entire pizza and it was not very fresh. I couldn't even taste it. My daughter ordered the shrimp scampi. She asked for some grated Parmesan on it and they brought her some packets of Parmesan and told her they couldn't find the grater. Really? I am giving them 2 stars only because I know how good it can be . how good it has been. I don't know what is going on here but they need some serious attention from upper management to get it back to where it used to be starting with the broken chairs.",1
this was my first experience with the conveyor belt type sushi. The sushi was not good at all. poor quality and tasteless. prices were very cheap which is probably why it was not tasty.,1
"This is a wonderful place great energy, constant support from the staff and other yogis, and inviting atmosphere. The only downfall is its location since I know where it is, I don't mind it at all. But it did take me 15 minutes to find the first time I tried going. I wish it were a little more visible to peeps that don't know what they're missing! n nI am becoming more and more of a regular here. I have enjoyed and been challenged by every class I've taken. Jim has a great attitude and is very encouraging about taking risks or just doing what's comfortable for you. All the instructors are really easy to talk to and guide some pretty stellar classes. I love both the Flow and Power classes. Yin Yang was a nice surprise.I thought it would be too low key for me but it was just right and Barb is a gem. One of these days I am actually going to take my lunch break at the studio and go to a Core Power Noon class. n nVery affordable and awesome vibes. My confidence in my ability to hold inversion poses grows with every visit. Namaste.",2
"This review is too long over due, this restaurant is how do you say Awesome! from the time you walk in and is greeted by the hostess which is a good looking, sexy , hot Filipino lady, the second thing that came to my mind was order your food,the Interior and ambiance was definitely up to par,there is a flat screen TV that was showing Asian news and a large projection screen TV that was showing a Asian dance videos, teppan style tables,also a sushi bar area in the rear,you can have your photo taken and place on the wall with the others 50 plus there.I had the make your own lunch set, fire cracker chicken, spicy cucumber, chicken basil, rice, and miso soup,the food was season very well and delicious,buy one beer or sake you get one free Sapporo, Asahi, Hite, Soju, Sake.cold or hot happy hour is all day long the menu has a lot of tasty Item to offer,Hard Rock Hotel to the west and UNLV is the the east.Recommended.",2
"I'm a huge fan of window shopping! And South Park Mall offers me a great variety of stores to enjoy! n n There is a little bit of something for everyone here.really pricey stores down to your everyday finds, they are always remodeling the shops and adding new businesses which is a really nice find! n nLots of parking and good restaurants are close by overall, not a mall I always need to shop at but for a fun weekend of window shopping its totally worth it!",2
"No complaints here! Did not have to wait long to order on the phone even for a Friday night! and customer service was efficient. The only downside to the ordering process was the mobile app in Safari on the iPhone, no I did not download the app I got flustered did not allow me to change the location for pickup, it only had a preset location near my office, not my house from a previous order. Moving on.the food was great, I mean Pizza Hut is Pizza Hut, so you can pretty much anticipate the end product. The one thing everyone raved about was the boneless chicken wings, they were good even being plain kind of upset they cost as much as they do and still do not include ANY dipping sauces ! BUT definitely will return.",2
I've read reviews of this in which the person said the food was great but the service was not so much. I completely disagree. The service was excellent and the food was even better. I highly recommend the linguine with clams or the venison. The wine was one of the best I've ever had which was recommended by the bartender . I would very highly recommend to anyone!,2
"Having Christmas Eve dinner with friends, we started with drinks and the fantastic guacamole with chips. As we filled up on chips, we joked that maybe we should have just stopped there and not ordered dinner. Little did we know how right we were going to be. n nWe went the tapas route rather than entrees. We ordered. n nDuck carnitas empanada The shell was tough, not tender and crunchy as it should have been. It also had a very distinct lemon flavor, which was ok, but a little odd. Otherwise, the duck filling was good. n nRoast Corn Gorditas The little silver dollar size gorditas were, again, tough. Almost inedible. Neither the amount nor the flavor of the topping was enough to overshadow this problem. n nShrimp Anticuchos Waaaaaay over cooked. I knew before I bit into it, too. I tried to remove the remaining shell from the tail and the shrimp didn't pull out of it too dry. n nChicken Anticuchos Dry and over cooked. Good flavors, though. n nBeef Anticuchos This one bright spot for the tapas dishes arrived very late. Hot, juicy, and amazing flavors. But. and this is a big one. The runner who brought it made a point of saying that the kitchen had 'run out' of these and had to make this one fresh. Um, what? Does that explain the other 4 dishes and their awful execution? We just happened to get a bunch of stuff that was pre prepared and sitting around? Suddenly it all made sense. n nBy the time we finished the beef, we were done but not full or satisfied obviously . We headed off to Grand Luxe not that many places to go on Christmas Eve, really and were happier there with a few tapas dishes and dessert. n nAnd a note for servers When you ask if everything is ok and everyone chuckles sadistically rather than answer, when you don't follow up, it's obvious you don't care. n nIn the end, other than the very late dish, service was pretty good. Drinks were good. Chips and guac were excellent. It just felt like the B team was in the kitchen so that the real cooks chefs could be home for Christmas Eve. So much potential, but so little execution.",1
"Phoenix airport Sky Harbor is one of the better airports to fly through. Mainly because there's quite a few selections for bars restaurants, as well as the weather there hot dry means less chance of weather related lay overs. awesome. Plus the ""people movers "" are fantastic.",2
"When we first arrived I was not sure what to do but the hostess was very nice. Every thing is buffet style but uncooked you pile your bowl as high as you can get it and they have recipe for you to mix sauces together to make specialty sauce either you are the waitress can make them. Then you watch the chef cook the food and sauce together in front of you . Quite an experience. I can say I honestly enjoyed there food so much I ate it for three days. Yes, I had that much left over .I ate it three more times after I left the restaurant and it was just as delicious. Follow the lead of everyone else pack the bowl so high it seems stupid. When it cooks down you'll be the smart one. Can you say .lunch ,dinner, lunch again all in one ",2
"OMG! That was the worst ever. I was so completely disappointed with this restaurant I can not believe it. We went in at 7 30 and they were out of all seafood no shrimp, no scallops, and believe it or not even plain fish either. The service was mediocre if not a tad rude and the portion sizes were paltry. I would have preferred PF Chang's, and we all know how Chinese that place is .",1
"Been going to this place for years. Used to be a great place to hang out but lately it's been overcrowded, the staff has an attitude and the noise level is sometimes unbearable as the staff keeps the stereo super loud. The wi fi connection as of late has also been hit n miss. They often have great local music on the weekend and I noticed the staff is much better then.",1
"I live around the corner and figured I'd give the place a try. Since it is a cafe I assumed they would have a variety of tasty sandwiches to choose from. Boy was I wrong. They literally have 4 sandwiches to chose from and they are nearly identical. 3 pieces of bread, mayo, and egg are on everything. They apparently think their clientele is made up of grade school children because they cut the crust off of the bread. n n The sandwiches are pre made, they just pulled it out of the fridge and gave me half. Good luck saying ""no mayo "". Who sells a sandwich by the half? It had 3 pieces of bread, a smearing of mayo with pimiento on one side, and a razor thin piece of cheese or ham in the other. When I saw how lame the sandwich was I asked for an Empenada too but they told me 10 minutes to heat it up. I wasn't waiting for that, I was hungry. The sandwich was average and even though he gave me a card to get a free sandwich, I will not be going back. n nThey sell smoothies if you are into that. But, they have the name ""cafe "" in the title so that is how they will be judged. Poor excuse for a sandwich, plus no variety, plus no substance, plus no selection equals a disaster of a place. n nDrink options are bottled soda or bottled water. After eating the 3 bite sandwich it literally could have been smashed into 1 bite in the car before pulling out of the parking lot I immediately wondered where I was going to get lunch. That is a bad sign. n nThere are way to many good places with variety, value, and freshness in the area to waste your time trying this place out.",1
"I was here and had great thai food back in 2008 and was eager to go back on my 2013 summer vacation. n nI dont know if i was unlucky this evening and they had some kitchen problems but the food was not as good as i remembered. I had the beef panang wich was ok but maybe a little bland. n nThe chicken with green curry was not only bland but had an odd taste that we never had before in thaifood. n nAll in all the food was not bad but a step down from what i consider ""ok "" and far from the last time i was there when i had 4 star thai food with fresh ingredients and lots of that famous chili punch.",1
Great patio ambiance but most limp Caesar salad ever drenched in dressing. Wings okay but ordered as appetizer 10 minutes before entrees and all arrived at the same time.,1
"Essence does have an amazing menu but the last two times I've tried to enjoy myself there it just hasn't happened. Twice in the last two weeks I've had experiences where I now will never go there again unless a group of friends decide that's absolutely the only place they want to go to brunch. n n1st experience About two weeks ago today. I had a busy day ahead of me but I had enough time to grab a coffee and some food somewhere before going about my day. I was craving their hot breakfast cereal with fruit and knowing how busy they can get I thought I should probably just call in a to go order and even if I have to wait a little while when I get there, that's fine because I can take it with me. The first time I called a girl answered the phone and instantly asked me if I could hold without even asking how she could help me, I said ""of course "". I stayed on hold for 15 minutes. I walked into my coffee shop, stood in line, ordered my coffee and when my coffee was done, I decided to hang up and redial Essence. I call again and sure enough ""can you hold please? "". I'm thinking ""really? "" but I say ""of course "" again. n nI'm on hold for about 5 minutes which is a long time when you're already a little frustrated waiting for 15 min the first time . I decide to hang up when I pull into their parking lot and no one has picked up the phone. I walk inside and to my surprise it wasn't as busy as I thought it might be which would justify the ignorance on the phone. I walked up to the counter and stated ""I need to place a to go order "". The look on the girls face was like ""crap, this might be the girl from the phone "". Still, I am a patient person and I thought ""its OK, I'm here now and I can just order "". As I was ordering one of the gals who works there was showing a girl how to use the register. It ALL made sense! This girl was new and they were trying to train her which was causing everything to be a little more backed up than usual. OK, now I'm not as mad. n nAfter placing my order I told the girls I would wait out on the patio. The girl retorted with a condescending tone saying ""Just place your number on the edge of the table and we'll find you "". Although, I've been to Essence MANY times and knew how their process worked, with their already awesome lack of service I felt I needed to verbally state where I was going to be. n nOK, sitting on the patio waiting for my food for how long now? I realize that there are other people who may have ordered before myself but waiting 25ish minutes for hot oatmeal is just ridiculous. It gets better, after I the whole ""I'll be on the patio "" fiasco. I see a girl pacing the shop inside holding a to go box looking desperately for whomever it could possibly belong to. At this point I'm thinking to myself ""you've got to be kidding me "". I just sat there and watched her walk around for a good five minutes if not longer. She finally went back to the counter and did an ""I don't know "" gesture. I decided to finally mosey on inside. The girl training her saw me frustrated, standing up and walking in so she grabbed the box and some silverware and handed it to me as i was approaching her. I was kind despite my annoyance and thanked her but come on meow. REALLY? n nA week and a half or so goes by and I think to myself, ya know what? I'm going to give Essence another shot. With their ridiculous hours I wasn't sure when they stopped serving breakfast so I tried to get their as soon as possible. I arrived at 10 45am and they stop serving breakfast at 10 30am which I will never understand from a business stand point especially given their awesome location. They are totally limiting themselves. I wasn't annoyed or bothered or frustrated because I could have easily looked up their menu hours and chosen somewhere else to go knowing I would miss the breakfast menu. Same two gals working by the way I was pleasant and ordered an iced coffee and a simple SIDE SALAD. Somehow my total came to around 9 after a tip. I'm thinking ""that's fine because I know they use fresh organic ingredients and I'm happy with that "". And then I also waited forever for my salad and once it got there the sad pile of green on my plate was enough to erk the evil Steph monster out of me. I was pissed. I downed my salad in maybe five minutes because I HAD to get out of there. I ate my salad so fast I didn't finish my iced coffee. I walked up to the counter to ask for a to go cup so I could take my remaining coffee with me. She told me I had to pay extra if I wanted to take it to go! ARE YOU SERIOUS? ""For a refill its more "" me ""but I don't want a refill. I simply want to take the coffee which I've already paid for with me "". ""Its still more if you want to take it to go "". She knew I was upset. I sat my iced coffee on the counter and left. n nI promise, I waited a LONG time and thought about all of this over in my head a few times before writing this review. I'll miss their breakfast but OH WELL.",1
"Quite possibly the worst doctor experience I've ever had. Dr. Halben was extremely rude and condescending I wouldn't wish him upon anyone, yet alone a worried mother. n nFor THIS I paid 150 and got less than 2 minutes of his time n nDr.H. walks in the room. nMe sorry, my baby is trying to climb under your sink. nDr.H. stoic and not amused Well unless he's my baby is a girl going to do some plumbing for me, he'd better get out of there. nI pull my baby out of the cupboard and Dr.H. asks Why is she correcting himself after seeing her cupcake pjs since he obviously didn't see her chart here? nMe Well she had an ear infection and nDr.H. And how do you know that? nMe we went to a doctor in Colorado and she had one. He prescribed amoxicillin but she's allergic so we stopped and I think she might still have her ear infection because she keeps pulling at her ears. nDr.H. started speaking over me at ""so we stopped. "" and how do you know she is allergic? nMe she got a rash and diarrhea and her face and tongue were all puffy. nDr.H. let me look at her ears. I sit her down on the exam table and he attempts to look in her ears but she is resistant and pulls away. He LITERALLY ROLLS HIS EYES AND HUFFS so I lay her down on the table and try to hold her arms down while he looks in her ears and she is SCREAMING and KICKING the whole time and he is clearly annoyed. well her ears look perfect. nMe oh well that's good. nDr.H. with no hint of joking in his voice who did she get the temper from?! nMe she's actually not usually like this. She's not feeling well and I didn't say it but what baby likes being held down on a table?! nDr.H. she has a viral thing that has irritated her throat but it will last 5 7 days and she'll be fine. Anything else? nMe no. nDr.H. okay, bye And then he leaves . n nAbsolutely the worst bedside manner I have ever encountered and I left a skeptical because my poor baby's ears hurt, I know it. b wondering why the hell he is a pediatrician if he clearly hates his job and or kids?! c pissed that I spent 150 on that! n nA side note Denise, the nurse at the front desk, was extremely pleasant and kind.",1
"For Valentine's day, I wanted to get my friend something a little nice to celebrate the day so went to Karsh's. How many times do you celebrate someones 89th valentines day. I walked in and looked at the cases. I hear laughing in the back. I walked around and looked at all the cases again.I saw the asst manager look through the window to see if someone was out there. I looked through all the cases twice more and walked out and went to Bashas. n nMaybe they don't like me there? n nA week later I went to buy some marbled rye bread there because didn't have the time to go to LaGrande Orange. Two people immediately asked to help me. This place does something to my head. I wish I could like the idea of going there. I DON'T but do so for my friend only now.",1

Super good. Great for birthdays and big groups.,2
"We have wanted to try this place after driving past it for the past couple years as the drive thru is always packed. I was disappointed in the small selection of meals.mainly unflavored tiny fried chicken strips with some frozen crinkle fries and a piece of bread.oh and some bland coleslaw and a not so very special sauce. Hardly what I would consider a decent meal much less pay for it and actually feel there is a need to actually have an establishment devoted specifically to this type of food. I mean, why develop an entire menu of meals where the main difference is the quantity of strips and sides? The bf thought it was okay but he had to order the large meal and also ate half of mine. The cashier was nice enough, but had either a hearing problem or attention deficit disorder.she had my drink order wrong twice.diet soda, no ice.not sweet tea with ice or diet soda with ice. I do not understand the hype at all especially when there are so many other places to choose from.",1
"Even with the 2 for 1 coupon, I'd say this isn't worth it. Go somewhere else and you might actually enjoy what you eat. Meats were bad, seafood was bad, and I didn't even bother with dessert. n nThe TI buffet simply serves very low quality food, and I think I even got sick later because of it.",1
I mean it is an airport restaurant bar.,1
Great guy! Very professional. He was able to come out same day to fix my oven problem and l wasnt charged an arm and a leg for it. I will definitely call him again if I have any more issues with my appliances.,2

"This place is a joke. Dont come here for food. My girlfriend got a deal on groupon no good can come from Groupon and wanted to go there for breakfeast. We both got omelets, both were over cooked and rubber. Both also came with a side of potatoes that were so burnt and chewy they were almost inedible. nThis place must only exist for desserts, which we didn't wanna try after our below average breakfast. nLike i said, This place is a joke. Charge 18 bucks for a omlete, but dont know how to cook an egg. Even with the groupon i feel over charged.",1
"Good and fast Chinese food at a reasonable price. n nThere aren't that many options for a quick and cheap lunch in this area, but this one satisfies both needs for right around 5. It isn't absolutely amazing and the lunch portion sizes aren't near as much as a lot of the cheap Chinese places are, but do you really need a to go box at lunch? n nI took a friend and we got the sesame chicken and the general's chicken. It comes with rice and an egg roll. Both entrees had a decent fried crunchy texture and a note of fruit. The sauces were a little thinner than most places but I don't mind not being dowsed with a ridiculous amount of cornstarch. n nIf in the area and not trying to deal with nuances of Piscies ""all you can eat "" sushi lunch special I will be back. n nFYI, take a look at the pic that had been submitted if you want an idea of portion size.",2
The smoked pork hock was huge that I could barely finish it. Also tried the pig tails in which the fat literally melts in your mouth. The dishes were leaning on the salty side but still tasty. Service was alright.,2
Was forced to go here because the rest of my family didn't want to drive too far. Don't go here unless you are ok with mediocre Italian food. Hardly any choices on the menu and not sure if anyone really enjoyed their meal. Spaghetti with meat sauce was watery. I created my own chicken pasta with garlic and oil sauce. No flavor at all. I just don't ever want to go back there.,1
"My family insists on going to this Chipotle because they like the food. I go next door to AJ's and buy my food because I would never eat in a place this FILTHY! Every time I go, same thing.

The health dept really needs to pay this place a visit!",1
Kentucky Fried Pork Chop with Georgia peaches and cream. Downed with red or white Sangria. Enough said. n nOne of the best values I've seen on the strip in a long time with all dishes very reasonably priced.,2
"Decor is strangely reminiscent of the movie swingers. Hotel has a 50s motif done tastefully. Got an awesome rate through the hotel tonight app on my iphone. My only complaint was that they had a very tiny self parking lot, almost forcing you to pay 14 bucks for the valet unless you want to do street parking. Room was surprisingly spacious and even had small balcony making it almost perfect if traveling with your dog as we were. Food and service at the restaurant was decent. If not for the parking, this place definitely deserves 5 stars.",2
"Many years ago, I owned a Saab vehicle. I loved my Saab but it broke down all the time and was completely unreliable. I had to take my Saab in for service and the dealership gave me a loaner car. The rental car they gave me was a Kia. To be more specific, they gave me a Kia with a booger on the steering wheel. I was so aggravated, I took that Kia and I drove it straight to the Mercedes dealership and I bought a new car. n nThat experience is much like the experience I had at CC Nail Spa today. I took my jacked up Happy Nails or I should say un Happy nails to CC Nail Spa. I read all the other Yelp reviews and made an appt. with Peter. Shazam! Peter did me right. I love my nails and I'm so glad I found this place!",2
"The only reason I gave one star is that the facility itself is set up nicely. And also because Yelp makes me give at least one. n nMy best friend and I decided to do a joint birthday party here for our two kids. Setting up the party was easy, and Tom was very nice about finding out what kind of decorations we wanted and so on and so forth. I even changed my mind on the theme a few days before, and he was totally fine with it. Okay, so far so good. n nWe get to the party, and right off the bat I'm being told that Tom has a stand offish attitude towards some of the parents, and I got that vibe also. He tells me to sign my daughter in the child column one of the birthday kids , which I thought nothing of at the time. Towards the end of the party I walk over to the sign in sheet to get an estimate of how many kids we had, because I had a feeling we had gone over by a COUPLE 15 kid limit, then you are charged 12 for each kid you go over. . Well to my surprise that are 26 kids signed on that sheet. Hmmm. That's funny, I look around and don't see 26 kids between the ages of 8 months and 8 years Which is what I was told when I booked the party, and asked what the age limit was for the kids counted in the party. I ask Tom if this is accurate, and he says ""Oh yea, the older kids are signed into the adult column. "" Whatever. It's close to the end of the party and I have a lot going on, so I was a little flustered. n nWe go to pay and are charged 96 over our original price for the 8 kids that were over the count. Plus 30 for people who forgot to bring socks, no problem, that's our fault. I have also been told by MULTIPLE parents that were SPECIFICALLY TOLD to sign their teenagers in the child column. Sooo basically you lied when you told me that the teenagers were signed in the adult column. He said it's not his responsibility to make sure the kids and adults are signed in the right columns. I beg to differ. If you are going to be taking people's money for whoever is signed in the kid's column, pretty sure it's your responsibility as the business owner to check it for accuracy. I wasn't informed that I should stand by the sign in sheet and tell people what to do, aren't you getting paid for that? n nThe next day we start going over our invites and the ACCURATE count of adults, children, and teenagers that were at the party. 18 excluding the two birthday kids. So we try to call Tom for an explanation. He's not there. The worker who answered said he would deliver the message, ok great. Call the next day, he won't be in until the evening. Ok. So I get on the website and send an email, no response. We finally get a hold of Tom on Wednesday and are told that even though we had older kids at the party, they were playing with some of the equipment, so we had to pay for them. I wasn't aware that 16 year old would be charged for entertaining the toddlers we had running around, and playing with them. I should have just told all the parents that if they were bringing older kids, they had to sit down and look at the ceiling the whole time we were there, so we could avoid a 500 party right? Babies that sat in the ball pit in adult's laps, doing nothing but sitting there and looking around? Boom. That'll be another 12. GTFO. n nHe offers to refund us for 4 kids, but not the full 8 that we were overcharged. Sooooo split between two party moms, that'll be 24 each? No thank you. It's not worth the gas or the frustration of having to step foot in your establishment again. If I wanted to spend 500 on a 3 year old's birthday party, I would have gone to Disneyland. n nNEVER AGAIN, KID'S KINGDOM. BAD, BAD BUSINESS.",1
"My wife and I strolled through Tivoli this morning and enjoyed the farmer's market they are hosting here on Saturday mornings. They do need more vendors like artisan breads, flowers, and more produce vendors. I did sample and purchase the tastiest corn I've had in Vegas.

The ambiance is stellar I really felt like I was back in NY or LA at an old school caf u00e9.

"Carmon's Creperie released their new lunch menu yesterday, and we had the great pleasure of being there to sample it! nAs always, options are really creative, but more importantly, delicious! Three of us tried the Scrambled Eggs Crepe with sausage, the Creamed Spinach Crepe with bacon and caramelized onions and the Hamburger crepe.you heard me, a Hamburger crepe! n All portions were generous, perfectly cooked and quick to the table. The scrambled eggs were really tasty, light and the perfect brunch. they would go so well with the House Signature Bloody Mary. The creamed spinach was smooth, sophisticated and rich. The hamburger crepe intrigued me on the menu, and I was suspicious of it, but I have learned to trust the excellent chef at Carmon's so I knew if it was on the menu, it must be good. And it was. It came with house fries which are to die for, and the crepe itself had all the flavors and textures of a hamburger, but with an Excellent pattie. this is now my favorite burger in town! nCarmon's have also announced a very nicely priced Wednesday night Crepe Wine flight for 28.reservations at 217 352 5880",2

"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. This place is by far THE WORST bakery I've been to, quality and customer service wise. I ordered a two tiered cake for my niece's second birthday a week in advance to the pickup date. The design was simple, bit of fondant dots and chocolate dots around the cake. They had a model design of the cake so I knew what to expect on pick up day. 6 days later I go pick up the cake and it looked like a DISASTER. The fondant on the sides were melting off of the icing leaving a trance of color on the white icing. The dots of chocolate MELTED on the sides, made the cake look like it was crying. I told the front manager and all she said was ""yeah it's really hot today "". Uh. Okay? What does the weather have to do with my cake? She brought the cake to the back to ""fix "", turns out she just slapped a bit more icing on the cake and pushed in the fondant. It looked like a 3 year old put the cake together. When I told her that it was for my niece she said ""oh well she's a baby, she won't remember "" OH THE NERVE. Please. Do NOT waste your time and money on this shitty place. Totally NOT worth even a penny.",1

"Terrible. I had a baby dress never worn other than to try on that was too small for my daughter. I went in with the tags and dress still on the hanger and asked if I could exchange it for a larger size or another similar dress. I waited 15 minutes while cashiers were unsure and the manager didn't even take the time to come our when they called for help or for MOD to the front. I was told I could not exchange the dress for another but the manager could probably ""work with me depending what kinda deal I was looking for "" and I could PURCHASE another dress with a discount and give them the dress I was returning. Never before have I experienced this in retail. Absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional.",1
"I'll go ahead and start by making the bold statement that these guys don't care about quality. I have an old Cadillac that was driven by a 90 year old man up until I got the car. The car was in perfect shape until I was rear ended. I decided to take it to auto body world since they're down the street from my house. I made it known on multiple occasions that I wanted the car exactly how it was before the wreck and they assured me that it will ""look brand new. "" I didn't notice how bad it was until I got the car home. Oh, a side note, they bring you your car when ""finished "" and park it in shaded covered parking so you don't notice their shoddy work. Long story short, there's parts listed on the paperwork that they supposedly bought to replace the damaged parts yet the damaged parts are still on the car. Weird. They replaced chrome parts with plastic and got overspray all over the front of the car. The trim doesn't fit together how it's supposed to and it has bends in it.it's not even flush to the panels. When the trunk was hit the latches were bent severely and they just did their best to bend them back even though they needed to be replaced. The most annoying thing.when I open the trunk it's supposed to open all the way without having to touch it. It now only opens a quarter of the way. And, conveniently, all of the sudden the interior left speakers don't work anymore. They certainly did when I dropped the car off. WTF! If you want your car to look like it came out of Maaco then go to Auto Body World.",1

"This was my first time trying this place and it will be my last! Horrible service! I went in to get a manicure. When I was greeted, the employee asked what I wanted. She tried convincing me to get a gel mani but I declined the offer. Her attitude went from super friendly to rude. My nail tech was a man and he was not friendly at all. You could tell he didn't want to be there. He did a horrible job on the mani. He didn't even up my nails and he left nail polish all over my fingers, didn't even bother to remove it afterwards. He rushed through the mani when he saw a client come in. I will never return to this place, what a waste. They should be closed down.",1

"Our family has been a fan of Monit's for about 40 years now. The last few times we went there I had been less than impressed with the service and food. They have made some changes evidently because this last experience was much better. Although the menu prices have gone up, the quality and service have improved dramatically over previous visits. The place looked like it had undergone some renovations and looked cleaner and fresher. Service was pretty quick and the food all done to perfection. Their rosemary bread is always awesome and we were all impressed. We will always be fans, but it was a nice improvement and glad to see it back to where it had been years ago.",2

I've been having Sam cut my hair since 2002 when he was at a former barber shop and moved over to Goodfellas. Such a great guy and really gets you in a good mood when you are there. You will feel like a million bucks after leaving. The barbers are a great bunch of guys. Sam is not in every day so I usually just walk in and have the next available barber cut my hair. So far I have not had a bad haircut yet. Definitely a little on the pricey side which is the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star. n nOther than that the experience is great and worth the extra few dollars for a haircut. Being able to watch TV each seat has a personal TV is a nice touch during your haircut. If you are up for a shave that is quite the interesting experience and something every guy needs to try out 1 time in his life. Definitely go and check out Goodfellas next time you need a haircut. You won't be sorry and the little massage hand machine they finish you off with at the end is quite nice.,2

"Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic. n nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf Bronson beans the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad. n nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful. n nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day.

"Sorry to rain on this one, but I was very disappointed by my meal. I'll do anything to avoid chains, so this place really sounded good . but it was not to be. n n I LOVE Bruschetta, but their bruschetta was disappointing. The bread was nothing special, and there was a lack of good tomato basil on top. There was a big dollop of goat cheese, which sounded good on the menu, but ended up not contributing much. My steak salad was not bad the grilled steak was good quality, and nicely cooked something many places get wrong but the croutons were the typical pathetic specimen you'd expect at Denny's. n nOverall, I found the menu confusing and the descriptions unappetizing. For example, there's a 'pasta' section, with this entry ""Love me Tender . nFilet mignon, in gorgonzola cream sauce with spinach, mushrooms, green onions and roasted red bell peppers "" Now how does a 'filet mignon' end up as a pasta dish? Is the pasta on the side? Is the filet all chopped up and tossed in with the pasta? Beats me! And the photos on the menu don't have captions so you have no idea which dish they are portraying.",1

A sample of the Cream Ale came with an eye roll and recommendation to order the flight. I'm sharing the samples with my wife, mind you. No worries, we are humble people, and he did provide the Cream Ale, which was lovely. But I really really wanted a sample of the Am. Pale Ale. We huddled and hatched a bold plan go with a 50 50 mixed pint of the Sour with the Am. Pale. We were counting on the Pale to be as awesome as the Sour, and also subdue it some, so my socks only rolled up down once. Of course the real brilliance was that we didn't need to upset Donny Darko for another sample. Well DD wasn't impressed. He lowered his head as if in pain as he poured. I tried to brighten him up 'you must get this request often, huh?' nSloooow painful shake of the head. 'Never'. Well buckle my chin strap if this wasn't a delightfully beautiful collision of deliciousness and, truth be told, DD made it a 70 30 mix no worries incentive to come back and experiment . I may never be forgiven by the Beer Gods of Etiquette or the bartender for my reckless behavior, but my taste buds keep asking me to go back. Hats off the the brewmaster. Fine selection indeed.",2
"Average food, average service, same 5 bands on rotation playing super loud 80s music. Manager is rude and just scowls at everyone. Clientele that believe it is still the 80s. Off track betting for the old guys. A handful of tweakers. A couple of homeless guys. What more could you want?",1
"I've been to other Doctors Express locations and loved them, so when my 4 year old got sick, I didn't hesitate to take her the one on Camelback. Well, the waiting room is clean and the staff were nice. However, the doctor at the Camelback location was absolutely horrible. He spent less than one minute examining my daughter and then looked at me and asked, ""Well what do you think I should do? "" In the end he misdiagnosed my daughter and seven days later I had to go to another urgent care where they told me she had pneumonia. If you have to go to this urgent care, refuse to see the old, male doctor. He's far from decent.",1
"What a disappointment. We began our late night 9 30 dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely ""small plates "" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth.yeah, it was a COCKROACH! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK! We then waited 45 minutes for our food an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are 16 and 18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that ""it was inexcusable the way the food came out which our server didn't monitor and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food. "" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10 45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij.",1
all the locals know only prositutes hang out there. Or maybe just because my family are cops. Either way. gross.,1
Sapporo is solid. Went with boyfriend and family visiting from out of town for teppan happy hour 7 days a week. 3 7pm . As entertaining and delicious as promised. A ton of food. NYstrip and chicken were delicious as was the veggies. Ok fried rice. Scallops well cooked but not very tasty. Sushi was great as well. The bus boy was pretty shocked there were no leftovers. Go early to avoid the crowd.,2
"I love Capriotti's, we order it at work for extended staff meetings because they deliver. n nHowever, this location delivers when it wants to. The reason for the inconsistency they claim is based on whether or not they are busy. I will never understand why you'd miss out on sales. n nWe were excited when this location opened, but we're missing our old location that was always able to deliver.",1
"Horrible customer service. I called first thing in the morning to make an appointment for a pedicure for 4 30 pm. I arrived at 4 30 and was told my appointment was for 4 00. I explained I didn't get off work until 4 and made it an appointment for 4 30. The owner, Jenny, said it wouldn't be too long of a wait. After 15 minutes I left highly disappointed. Completely disappointing since I have been a customer since this salon opened. Will not return after this awful experience!",1
"Since I've lived in LV I have found anything service related to be sub par. But these guys were great on the phone and when they showed up. They were professional, on time and did a great job. I'll be using them again.",2
"I've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. The service was very attentive, but I felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table waiting 101. Our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. I honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food prices that leave me less than satisfied. n nGuacamole 15 Although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. There were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something I could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. The only thing that I didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. It was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips. n nLarge pot of Jasmine Downy Pearls 8.88 Very aromatic and tasty. I would probably come here just for the tea. n nChips and salsa 4 I hardly touched the salsa, but I ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. Definitely worth the four bucks. n nPescado Frito 6.50 Not very flavorful and not very ""fried. "" If I'm going to pay 6.50 for ONE taco, I expect it to be pretty damn good. n nDancing Eggplant 9.88 The waitress seemed a little reluctant when we ordered this. She made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. I had the feeling she didn't like that at all. We thought it was just okay. n nTraditional Sui Mai 13.88 I really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the Sui Mai. The edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation. n nDon't Be Jealous Hot and Sour Soup 8.88 This was the most disgusting Hot and Sour soup I have every had. It seriously ruined my palette. The whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. I have NEVER tasted Hot and Sour soup like that before. I couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. Don doesn't even like Hot and Sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others. n nRou Jia Mo Street Sandwich 8.88 Way too salty and saucy. And for a whopping 8.88, this was definitely not worth it. n nJericalla 11 Have you ever had Abuelita Hot Chocolate? It comes in a package like this http beautifulspitup.com wp content uploads 2011 12 abuelita mexican hot chocolate1.jpg containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon http beautifulspitup.com wp content uploads 2011 12 cut abuelita.jpg. Well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of Abuelita Hot Chocolate http s3 media2.ak.yelpcdn.com bphoto V1zh1nc2VASkoNUsyJS5JA l.jpg and no, that was not a good thing. I felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. I mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but I couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. Plain and simple, it sucked. n nOverall, I loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. The Hot and Sour soup really killed it for me. The only thing I think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something I would drive over here for. n nWarning If you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to ""pre authorize "" themselves for a 30 tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. Why anyone would give this place a 30 tip is beyond me.",1
"Spent Valentines here with my hubby and our bff's who are also married! We got there around 11 00pm and that was excellent because it permitted us to watch a movie first! The food was phenomenal! We had fresh oysters, the prime age rib eye, filet mignons, shredded twiced baked potatoes, whipped potatoes, calamari, GEESH, and creamed spinach. I am a bit ashamed because i didn't know we ate so much. Oh geez and not to go without mention they have a fabulous full bar we indulged our selves in nCoronas, Cognac Hen dog, and Adios Mutha F kas! All tasty and got the body warming. The food was cooked to perfection and the atmosphere was great. n n nOur server was Sarah and she was great ! The manager was rude about us being there late, but ill take that up w her boss on Monday! n n 430 tab plus tip close to 500 for the dinner. id say it was worth the flavors and experience!",2
"Told to come here by various sources for their fresh dumplings handmade. Severely disappointed. Came by and the waiters and waitresses talked for quite a while before noticing we were standing there in our coats waiting to be seated. n nWhen ordering, they were missing most of the things on the menu mind you we came at noon when you should be completely stocked. n nWe got shrimp and tofu dumplings pan fried.

my favorite mexican fast food place in Glendale area. Surf n Turf burrito and fish taco combo for 6.99 is amazing deal. the salsa bar is also unique and very flavorful.,2
"The decor changed but the service didn't .unfortunately! n nSo I've been here before on a first friday late night, it's great if you are with a small group of people and want a drink and something small to eat that's spicy. However, this time around, I was with a bigger group 8 and the service was totally below par.can you tell me when I'm getting my other dish.server. ""Um.I don't know, I'm just serving "" .and the food, yeah it's good if you want everything with chile oil sauce in it. The tofu with sesame sauce was good, but still spicy like everything else that we had that evening. Very disappointing for the price of each tapas.",1
One of the nicest Irish Pubs I've been too.,2
"Went down to check this place out for lunch. The atmosphere is nice, the prices are on the upper end for Mexican food but I'll forgive them that because the food is high quality and prices in the area are high in general. However, the service was poor. The restaurant was slow, and it looked like there were plenty of staff, but we felt like we waited too long to place our order and get our receipt. While the food is good, overall I'd rather eat at Casa Don Juan or Los Tacos.",1
"This place has been around for a while had a different name remodeled and I could probably count the number of times that I have been here on one hand. I have some mixed reviews on this place. The stars keep falling as I keep going back there though. n nFirst couple of visits were pretty good yummy foods, good portions, tasty drinks on their beautiful ambiance of a patio. n nHad a big birthday party on their patio back in April it was very delightful and the waiters were pretty attentive to our large party 20 people they just keep bringing more and more bottles of wine great time, but I was a little afraid of what the bill was going to look like since they weren't even asking anyone if we wanted more wine bottles opened. n nI have enjoyed a nice satisfying meal in a booth with a friendly waitress on another occasion. n nThis past weekend I arrived on a Saturday evening at 6 15 with 4 other party members. We generously accepted red wine when we sat down, but had to wait over 45 minutes to get our starter dinner salads. One of my friends ordered a vodka cranberry and 2 of us tasted it and it tasted pretty ""nonalcoholic "" so we had to send it back to ""The Lounge. "" I felt like we were just filling up on their complimentary bread a pesto the whole time while waiting forever for our food to get to our table. The pizza selection was interesting I think I could only find one with red sauce and the waitress was surprised to find the same results on the menu when we double checked. For dinner I shared a small pizza, and it didn't come out looking like what the description had said and I looked over at another friend and her husband's ""split "" dish dinner it consisted of 2 ravioli's on one plate and 3 on the other I felt so bad for them that I offered to share some of my share of pizza to them and they accepted with more satisfied bellies in the end. I don't know if the kitchen was backed up or what not, but I have recently heard from friends that it has not been a great experience at this restaurant for them either. n nAll in all the food and wine is good, but don't expect quick service or larger portions these days. I'm not sure you'll be getting what you're paying for, but hey I can't complain on the price too much since I used a QUICK TIP RESTURANT.COM coupon on the last evening I spent there!",1
"Ah, another dive bar that made for an epic evening for birthday shenanigans. n nThis place is pretty cool for the dive scene. It was a very empty night when we came, however, that did not take away the chill atmosphere. Amber is a pretty awesome bartender. She took care of my group very well as she was training the new girl behind the bar. n nWe had the jukebox playing all night, no complaints from the few other guests that were there. We played pool and even ate some Cheez It party mix that they were giving out in little dishes! I like it because Dino's has popcorn that they give out and this place does Cheez Its! And I have a thing for Cheez Its. Just saying. n nI heard they also have karaoke and by reading some of the reviews I think I heard correctly. I will have to go check out the karaoke scene sometime! n nThis place was cool. I love my dive bars and this will probably be added to my list! Ooo, idea for Yelp list! ",2
"The laser tag was ok, it's not very big. And 7 for 5 minutes of running in a small space just doesn't entice me enough to want to come back. Tried the mini golf too, the 3D thing really wasn't working for us, my kids didn't even want to wear the glasses because the kids were complaining that it made them dizzy because it was blurry to look through. The arcade is funny, not really much of an arcade, the decor is done very cheaply, it looks like they are in the process of renovating but not . The second room of the arcade has only a few games by which the others were out of order. The mini golf is outdated. I suggest doing the laser tag instead but don't know if I would come back to do that.",1
Skip this location and go the extra few miles to the Geno's on Williams Field near Val Vista. The Famous cheesesteak at this location is hardly worthy of the name. At the Williams Field location you'll get a proper cheesesteak. 1000 better than here.,1
"Situated in the heart of Little Italy, Pizzeria Napoletana is known for it's thin crust Naples style pizzas. We went there on a Thursday night and there were at least 10 people waiting outside on the sidewalk for their turn and it was not even 7 in the evening. The pizzas are good, a bit expensive but perhaps on average only as expensive as pizzas at other restaurants in Little Italy. n nThe service however was very bad. Since there are always people waiting outside, the waiters seem to rush everything which we didn't like. If you're comfortable with in and out burger style eating then this joint might be your thing. This also means that the waiting time between you asking for the bill and waiter bringing it to you could be anywhere between 15 20 minutes. n nThe other negative point about Pizzeria Napoletana is their seating arrangement. Their dining rooms yes they have more than one dining room, 2 1 2 in fact can look and feel very crowded at times because there's hardly any place to move between tables and chairs. You could easily listen to what people around you are talking about without wanting to eavesdrop and people did tend to speak louder in this restaurant than in any other restaurant I've been to, I don't know the reason though . n nOnce again the pizzas are ok but the service and ambiance leave a lot to be desired.",1

"Rainy Sunday lunch. Beer selection is good, adequate and cold enough. Food was very good. Wife had tacos and preferred the Stockyard as it had a great unique flavor while the Red Neck was equally good but had that expected in a southern pull pork BBQ joint. I had the pull pork sandwich was pretty dog gone good with the BBQ slaw on it. The vinegar based ""sauce "" was unique which should have pushed the ranking to 5 stars, but . The ""beef "" I have with the place is the price. 7.50 for a sandwich and 10 for 2 tacos is steep which for those prices should have included a couple hush puppies a staple of all southern BBQ joints.",2

Great food and service! ! Chopped salad is a must! I had scallops cooked perfect and very tasty. My husband had the fish special which was also great. Will definitely be back if ever in Phoenix again.,2
The service was terrible and the food wasn't much better. It took an hour to get our food and my water was empty the entire time. I definitely won't be going back.,1
Accidently spilled a drink on the table and it took asking the servers and fifteen minutes to get any service. Food was not notable. Average food at high prices. Location is nice though. There are better options on the strip.,1

Would have been nice to enjoy a swim and dip in jacuzzi. Next time I suppose. n nHighly recommend and I'll always stay here.

"I had been wanting to try The Tin Kitchen for a while because I know the owner's mother. My husband and I saw the truck in a long line of other vendors, so we decided to visit. It turns out that The Tin Kitchen was part of a fundraiser for cancer, and we were supposed to buy tickets for the event. Because we were hosting a dinner party that night, we told The TIn Kitchen that we would try them another time. They insisted on giving us food anyway! I had the buffalo cauliflower tacos and the pickled vegtables. Both were delicious. The buffalos cauliflower tacos were topped with blue cheese. I was warned by the chef that the pickled vegetables were very spicy, but I love hot food and found them to have a nice, mild burn. My husband ordered the pork loin tacos and enjoyed them as well. Very pleased with the food, as well as the friendliness of the staff. Will definitely order from them again!",2

"You can pass on this one. This is a product of the gentrification of east liberty and should be treated as such. It's fake fake fake. nWent here for takeout with a craving for jerk chicken. I would have been much better served to drive a little farther to Impressionz on Broad street. The food was hotter than it should be to be so bland. I ordered the jerk chicken but got the curry chicken by mistake. It was spicy but overall bland and overpriced. The portion size was also smaller than you would get elsewhere. The jambalaya was also very spicy but without real flavor. I also tried the avocado fries which could have been good but were too greasy. I didn't try any of the ""latin "" dishes but I won't go back. There is really good Jamaican food in Pittsburgh but you will have to go to the ""hood "" to get it. Don't go here for it.",1
"It was me and my boyfriends 2 Year Anniversary, and we wanted to something fun to celebrate. Naturally we went to VEGAS! We wanted to have a nice romantic dinner, I had searched and found Mon Ami. It had great reviews so I went with it. I got reserverations and thank God I did! It was pretty packed. We had shown up 10 minutes late and there was a line, they seated us right away and asked if it was our first time there. They explained all the fancy lingo on the menu and told us what we should try if we were feeling adventurous. The prices are pretty pricey, but hey it's our anniversary. My b f got the Filet Mingon marinated in Merlot. I got the Herb Chicken. Man OH Man! It was the MOST DELICIOUS MEAL I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE! I was so glad I picked this place.

If you want great pizza in the vegas area you have to eat here.",2
"Yuck! I can only speak about the breakfast buffet but for 20 plus tip you would think the quality of the food would be a little better. In good Vegas fashion its all flash and no substance. Sure they have all kinds of food,Chinese, pizza etc for breakfast but the quality of the ingredients is low low end. Bruised fruit, rancid tasting hollandaise, smoked salmon that smelled like old socks and watery coffee. Even the lighting is depressing like they only had money left over for some cheapo neon tubes. I guess if I had been drinking and gambling all night I might have enjoyed this before going to my room to sleep it off. My advice, unless drunk skip this place.",1
"This is one of the first hotels that I have stayed at prior to the Venetian. It is a hotel for kids. The rooms are not as fancy as the Venetian. There is a coupon book given for guests.

People smoke in the casino, so you will smell it when walking to the adventuresome or the main gaming area.",1

"This place needs some serious overhauling. The food, once you finally get it, is pretty good. But, the service is terrible. We were there at 1 o'clock on a Monday afternoon when a lunch crowd should have been underway. There are about 3 or 4 tables total in the whole place, and our server, while very friendly, was super slow. Hubby had an iced tea, needed to flag Jebidiah down for a refill. There is no reason food should have taken literally 28 minutes, I had a salad and my husband had a sandwich. Like I said, it tasted fine once it arrived but I think a cardboard box would have also tasted great as we waited so long for its arrival. No wonder this place keeps putting out Groupons, I think it's the only reason people actually frequent it. My initial visit to this place a year ago was great, however every time that we have been back since has been terrible.",1
"Uh, I was expecting something like Curry House back home in Hawaii, especially considering the decor looked like a downgraded version, but I was awfully disappointed. I had the curry udon with chicken karage and the portions were pretty small, for the price you pay definitely not worth it. The chicken karage also tasted funny. All in all, I probably would not come back.",1
"My daughter had her Birthday party here last year and she thoroughly enjoyed herself. The party was enjoyed by children and adults alike. My only gripe would be the rushed putt putt playing, since with a large group of kids it seems they hurry you through. The party room isn't exactly separate from the public either, but that wasn't really a problem. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The magician they hired to perform during the party the amazing Wayne? was hilarious. He had everyone laughing and joining in. I have some of the best pictures of my 7 year old laughing with an open mouth at his antics. The price for the party was fair, the pizzas were literally ordered from Dominoes and delivered to the door. I think this is a nice alternative for an indoor Birthday party. We have since been back just to play putt putt and the kids loved it. When the temperatures soar and you get tired of swimming, this is a nice retreat.",2
"An all around great restaurant! The service is friendly and fast and the food does not disappoint. The sausage plate and goat cheese appetizers are both fantastic as well as the complimentary pretzel rolls. They have plenty of traditional German fare such as Weinerschnitzel, sauerkraut, spaetzle, etc. and it is all delicious! Beware the portions are HUGE. Luckily, they offer a ""Lite Appetite "" menu as well. If you save room for dessert, the apple strudel is a must. It's great to have this restaurant in Charlotte, it's very unique and stands out.",2
Placing a delivery order over the phone is just painful. I had to repeat myself again. And again. And again. I ordered the fresh Thai Spring Rolls and a chicken and shrimp pad thai spicy level 5. The spring rolls fell apart as soon as I picked them up because the shell was too watery. The pad thai was just dry and gross. The chicken was so dry I ended up eating only the shrimp. Not the best Thai food I've ever had. Lots of room for improvement in service and quality of food. I won't be coming back.,1
"Terrible experience. Pushy sales person and manager and outright lies about competitor services. This is an awful approach to try to gain the trust of a prospective SECURITY system buyer. n nReceived an ad in the paper so I called to inquire. I was told by the representative, Skyler, that because of my call timing I was eligible for an additional 500 in free equipment. When I asked if I could receive a written quote, he told me no, also that he wouldn't guarantee the deal if I called back, even though I said I wanted to discuss options with my spouse. He also cut down competitors services, which is somewhat expected, but in this case were outright lies contract length, renewal, coverage, response time, etc. n nNeedless to say, I went with Protection One. My customer service person Greg was helpful, responsive, and provided me a written quote. Services and equipment was comparable as was monthly fee 3yr contract . I went so far as to explain my experience with Skyler and ensured an extra kudo was passed along to Greg for being so professional normally not my style since I expect quality service but after my ADT experience it was clearly deserved . n nToday, a week later, Skyler followed up to see what I had decided. When I told him I went with a competitor he said ""oh sorry, good luck with. "" then proceeded to list all the lies he told me before which, based on my contract with P1 were completely untrue .

"This place manages to have worse customer service than both the MVD and Walmart, which is pretty impressive. n nThe lack of customer service coupled with world class apathy makes me cringe. My experience has truly astonishing and I look forward to finding a different provider, ASAP. n nLong story short, I need routine respiratory supplies, and they are supposed to be mailed on a quarterly basis. For some reason in June I didn't get my supplies, but being super busy and working 60 80 hours a week, I didn't have time to call them. Flash forward to Sept give or take and I called asking where my items were. I was told that there was a computer glitch and my new address wasn't the one being used for mailing. No problem, things happen they said they would fix it and send over what I needed. n nFast forward to October, and I still don't have the stuff. I continue to make do with my old stuff, and then remember to call Valley Respiratory and ask what's up. The person there was nice and said that she didn't know why I didn't get my order, it was never shipped but she would send it out. I never got that shipment either, but with the busy holidays I didn't get a chance to call until Nov Dec. I again spoke with an employee who said she would mail it out, and also let me know that in Jan I would start receiving my stuff three months worth at a time. I never received anything until the end of Dec, when I got the three months supply that is for Jan March. I have no idea what happened from June Dec, but eight months passed without supplies, and all the while my insurance company was being billed, and they paid for supplies I never received. n nI called today and spoke with a nice RT, who put me on hold, and a new person, whom I presume was a supervisor spoke with me. This person was very condescending and essentially shit all over me. It's worth noting that I am very laid back and I don't get upset or yell, or any other douchey behavior. I can't help but see that people who tantrum get more when they encounter these situations, but that's not me, so I tried to explain what happened and asked her to mail me my supplies, that were still missing since June. This woman was clearly annoyed and said that I should have called them and told them about the problem. I reminded her that I had called several times since June, and was still waiting. The woman told me that ""normal people "" call sooner, and that I had a month from the time they were supposed to ship it, to call and advise them that I never got the package. I am unsure how I am supposed to know when they are sending me things, when they are eight months late in sending me my last supplies. Perhaps I should employ a psychic? I asked her how they could bill my insurance for things that I never receive, and she essentially said that they don't know I didn't receive them. So now I am a liar too, which is nice. n nAll in all, I don't think you should have to micro manage a company who is supposed to have their act together. Mistakes will happen, and that's ok, but when a mistake does happen, don't treat your customers like shit, and tell them that they are doing it all wrong. The bigger issue is that when I am telling them I never received the shipment, I am told that it must have been stolen. I told her that since I hadn't received my supplies in 8 months, a more likely scenario is that they never sent it, but she said that it had been sent. So miraculously, all my Amazon.com packages were safe from the roving thieves pillaging my neighborhood, but a small, light box from them was stolen? Uhh, ok that makes sense. n nTo recap, it's forgivable to mess up shipping something, but it is unforgivable to treat a customer so poorly, and to bill for items that were never shipped or received. I highly recommend you go elsewhere, save yourself headaches, time, and energy.",1
"I really don't see what all of the fuss is about over this place. The chicken is decent but nothing worth writing home about, doesn't have any sort of kick. Sides are okay, tater rounds are probably the best part. Why this place constantly wins best fried chicken in Charlotte is beyond me.",1
"This place rules! The food was amazing, the beer delicious and the service top notch. Great music playing as well! And with lots of things to choose from, we will be back again and again!",2
"This hotel has no customer service at all! No smiles,no nice greeting,and bad attitude at check in. like they forced to be there I called housekeeping as soon as we checked in because there was no remote in the room and the person that answered was rude and said ""remote? Remote for what? I was like for the TV? Is there something else in the room that needs a remote? nRooms are very old but loved their beds though at least the one we had ndon't think I would stay there again",1
Terrible service. Food was good,1
"Great people, clean and organized place. Check in and check out went very smooth unlike some other reviews. We are from Southern California and the new customer setup over the phone went very well. I appreciate their vaccination policy. n nThey took great care of my baby Zack. They seemed genuinely concerned for his welfare. For his first time at a boarding, all went well. n nWe will return.",2
"I came here on a saturday afternoon and it was my first time there. HOUR AND A HALF WAIT?!?! There was a big long booth and 4 tables open? You kidding me? n nI'd like to give zero stars on the service because let me tell you, I have never experience the type of service they were giving that day. Dora, the hostess had an attitude on her. Every so often I would check about how much longer until our number will be called and she said ""I am sorry I cannot give you that estimiate because it depends on how fast people eat. "" Really? nThen our number was skipped because she said they had to get the table ready but there was two other tables ready, I didn't understand it. I saw a customer trying to ask her a question and she turned her back at him and was like you need to go talk to your waiter and the customer was so upset, he just walked away. I think Dora should brush up on her customer service skills and be a little more happier next time. n nI gave 2 stars and put up with the wait because I heard the food was worth it. In the end I was very satified with the food but it just didn't seem like a happy environment. The place seemed stressed out.",1
This is my new spot for my fitness needs. Tons of instructor base and On Demand Fitness Classes are available. n nFree Parking even on game day and special events. And did i mention you get to watch the game and event for free?! There is also a Free Shuttle Service that conveys fitness fiends from their boring cubicle to the weight room in less than 5 mins!,2
"My husband and I stayed there over a weekend Saturday Monday . The check in was okay. The lady wasn't friendly, but it was easy. Our room was ok. I've had way better rooms at less expensive hotels. We were really disappointed at the tv and cable. We came with a group of friends so we had time to relax in the room before meeting up again. Not only were channels limited, the tv would freeze. I was also disappointed at the lack of restaurant options and the food available. Over all I wouldn't recommend or return.",1
"Los Olivos is a quiet resturaunt in the Old Scottsdale city near the SF Giants spring training site. That is how I happened on this wonderful family style eatery. Arrived to the area to meet a Good HS friend and was way early. Used the Yelp app on my phone and soon I was here! Seated with out any wait. The place was just picking up since the ball game was not to far off and it was Dinner time as well. Service was very efficient and pleasant. I'm partial to Chicken what ever in these Mexican style resturaunts, and had a 'Chimi'. Arrived shortly and enjoyed it emencely. nI would recomend Los Olivos to anyone. Looks as if they can handle most any size group as well! Everything is reasonably priced as well. Enjoy! Holla!",2
First. it's a pub and you have to realize the food is pub food. Not fine dining. The sheppard pie was meh. The meat was more like ground beef than chunky beef as described in the menu. There wasn't much texture on top of the pie. I was expecting some kind crusty texture. The drunken onion rings had no bloody mary type flavor. Tasted just like Onion battered with the fish n chip batter. The service and beers were good. I would say go here to get your drink on and grub a little on some mediocre food.,1
Came in for a slow leak in a tire. The wait was a little long even to check in for my appointment but the problem was minor and they didn't charge me anything even for labor and it's now fixed. I'm sure if I had come at a less busy time the wait wouldn't have even been an issue. I'll go here again for any future tire problems.,2
"This restaurant was really great! I went with my family at 11 30 for brunch and was very satisfied with my experience. The restaurant is huge and the little details make it special. You can tell that it is inspired by Buddy's family which gives it a homey and comfortable feel. The coffee and food was fantastic as well as the service. We ordered the eggplant Parmesan, buddy's pizza, pasta carbonara, calamari, caprese, spaghetti and meatballs, and the tomato soup. Everything was so delicious and satisfying. The dessert menu was a nice touch as well because it is like a family photo album which I thought was a nice detail. Service was excellent and our wait staff was very attentive. We ordered in advance from Carlo's bakery and ate in in the restaurant along with our coffee. Overall this place was excellent and I will probably be back in the future.",2
"Came to opening at midnight last night. My wife, her friend and I were among the first hundred or so in. We basicly just followed the throng through the casino till we found some video poker to slide into. I actually did alright but both of them lost. That was the good part. Now the bad. n We have been staying all week long at the Pallazo but thought it would be exciting to spend the first ever night in a new place, so we booked the last night in town here. Got here around 9am to check in and found out our reservation had been booked with a card that we had voided, so it took a half hour combined brainpower of the receptionest and manager to figure it out. Also some computer glitches weren't helping, but finally got it squared away. So when we got to the door and swung it open, I was prepared to be floored, but was underwhelmed. Room not that big dirty windows for a new place soiled carpets from construction, I believe. Safe is in nightstand, but was covered withdust. Also dust on shelves. Went to check out the flat panel TV and it does not work at all. It is hooked to the Controll4 unit, butcould'nt make it work, even pushing buttons on side of TV itself. Two of the lights worked backward with control4. Looked for guest info in guest services binders, but they were empty. Also no stationary in desk drawer. Shower looks kinda cool, with tub and shower seperate but in same stall. Haven't showered yet with their low flow nozzle so hope I canrinse shampoo out of my hair. Also it is suppose to be a "" smart "" room key that remembers your temp, light settings, etc whenever you return to your room, even if it is months away. n All in all, palazzo is much nicer and cheaper we were comped there, 300 here and as a previous reviewer said, they weren't quite ready to open",1
"Late review. In 2012 I was working for a construction company. I was in Vegas every other week so I was able to try almost every hotel in town. Silverton, hands down is my absolute favorite. n nThe rooms are nice, the beds are amazing. The staff very friendly and by the end of the project, they knew me by name. The little gym wasn't on par with some of the bigger hotels like South Pointe but it is free. Which is better than nothing. n nThere were a lot of great places close to the hotel to get something to eat and having a starbucks downstairs was a HUGE plus. n nThe mermaid bar was always my go to spot. Drinking and watching jelly fish swim around? Awesome unless there is a dead one floating around but they take care of the tanks really well, so I am sure they die from natural causes . The mermaids are great too, I always got a kick watching little girls stare into the tank in awe but a Santa Clause mermaid, uhhhh. that was a little too much. but kids loved it. n nThey also hosted the food trucks there a few times, which made the stay even more pleasurable. n nBass Pro shops? Perfect for shopping for those one off gifts for those hard to shop for at Christmas time. Sadly, there are none near to me where I live. n nI always recommend this place to friends and family. Its not too far from the strip as long as you have a rental car and they do offer a shuttle!",2
usually always get take out. have no complaints. have had a wide variety of items on the menu and never disappointed. prices are reasonable. and the burgers are really good. great flavor great bun. its always nice when a place has a really good burger along with a menu with a diverse menu. also we have been going there since the first year they opened and it has always been good. we have never had anything bad.,2
"Not one of the newest, hippest casinos on the strip, but it's on the strip! It's fairly priced, all the casino gambling you need, but most of all it's one of the most comfortable beds in Vegas. The pillows are nice and soft and the mattress is welcoming. n nThe parking structure is fairly simple and can usually get a spot near an elevator. The variety of quick food stops here is pretty good such as ice cream, pho, a buffet with a short line, and just a regular sit down restaurant. n nThis is a very good deal when you find rooms on sale. The check in time took a while but what hotel doesn't?",2
"We hired this company to move some furniture from our storage area to our new office at Edgewood Towne Center. The movers were punctual, careful, and thorough. None of our furniture was damaged and the final cost of the job was within the price we were quoted. The gentlemen that came to do the move carefully wrapped all of our antiques and fine furniture and handled everything as carefully as they would have handled their own stuff. I would use this service again in a heartbeat!",2
"There is nothing, and I mean nothing, harder than giving a store that sells alcohol less than five stars. I'm not saying I'm an alcoholic, but I love vodka. n nMy favorite TW M is in Springfield, VA. That store did not mess around. It had what you needed, how you needed it, when you needed it. My addiction was sated here each and every time. n nAnyway, this was my first visit to this store. I've slowed down a lot in the years that I acquired the hobby of drinking great beer vodka wine so I don't make as many trips, or I just grab my favorite beer at Whole Foods, et al. So I was pretty excited to be walking into one of my favorite places! n nWalked in the door and immediately you're bombarded with bottles everywhere. If you were 12 and this was a candy store your heart would stop from the excitement. I'm not saying alcohol is my candy, but this looks like a pattern. Sorry. So, you THINK you have all these choices, but you really don't. n nThis store has inventory, I know they sell a variety of things, but it's not as abundant an inventory as it seems. I love Chimay. They carry it, but it's a small selection. Their Polish beers were gone, but for one six pack. They hadn't heard of others. I asked for three different kinds of bourbon, they'd heard of one of them. One guy that was 'helping' me also had this oddly annoying habit of actually having a microphone to talk into, but instead of using that, he'd walk to the front of the store to ask if they had what I needed. So weird. n nEveryone was pretty helpful and I finally found what I wanted sort of. So, I go to check out. n nThey don't refrigerate a lot of the beers, but seemingly had a solution in a fridge that could cool them down in seven minutes. I don't know why I didn't do that with my beer while I was looking for bourbon, but I just didn't. I lost track of time and no one mentioned it to me so I was just wandering around and the store closed. By the time was up at the register it was about 10 after. The manager was visible perturbed. n nLet me tell you something. Perturbed is what you feel when you're in traffic, your dog pees on your floor or your next door neighbor doesn't return your rake when you need it. Perturbed is NOT when a paying customer is standing in your face about to purchase something from your establishment. n nI asked him if he wouldn't mind me cooling off my beer in his cooler for a few minutes as I'd forgotten to do it. Let me tell you, this man showed zero restraint in holding back his irritation that I was still in his store after closing AND wanted to stay longer. I asked him if there wasn't someone else in the store still shopping, he said yes, I asked then if I could just cool the beer down until they got to the front. PERFECTLY REASONABLE REQUEST. He was so rude that I told him so. Seriously. YOU ARE RUDE. He didn't care at all. 'He was trying to get his employees home.' Welcome to RETAIL, rude manager. n nI wouldn't go back to this store and spend my money if my life depended on it. I'm not sure he realizes that everyone sells what he has elsewhere. I'm sad, though, I have always, always loved this place. Just a little patience and kindness would have given them a loyal customer forever. Boo.",1
"Lovely waitstaff, atmosphere and food! Best combination, the trout, wine and chocolate mousse was absolutely delicious. The crust in the open face trout had a perfect crunchy sear and still moist inside. Can't beat the view if the dancing Bellagio Fountains while enjoying the meal. When the weather is beautiful, this is the place to go!",2
My experience at Wazuzu was perfect. The staff was friendly and efficient. I eat a vegan diet and enjoyed the tofu with green beans and the vegan fried rice. Beautiful presentation and delicious. Wish I had some right now!,2
"A good friend referred me to Ed Adler. n Not having used a Realtor before I had no idea what to expect. From our first conversation I knew I was going to be working with someone who loved what he did. And immediately I felt I was a priority. He showed me how to use the MLS and when we began looking I knew he had done his homework for me. Ed, has a great sense of humor and is not shy about good feedback on a property that we looked at. He takes everything into consideration. Not just the condo itself, but takes the time to get to know his client so that if the neighborhood is not right he will speak up and not waste my time or his if he feels it is not the right fit. I had fun looking for my condo with Ed. His input, his ideas, his knowledge helped me to make the right choice for me and saved me money. When we found my condo, we both knew it nright away. I was thrilled and he was so excited for me. Ed is more that just a Realtor. He knew I needed some direction in upgrading the unit and he brought the right people together to help me make my condo a real home. I move in tomorrow and my condo is stunning. nThe neighborhood is perfect for me and I am just thrilled.To tell you the truth Ed is ""Your Real Estate Consultant for Life "". He did so much for me as he will for any client. n If you are looking for a Realtor who is compassionate, kind, very knowledgeable and funny then run to your phone and call Ed. You will have an amazing experience and I guarantee you will find the home you have always wanted. n nDonna P. nPhoenix",2
"Our new local greek joint! nthe gyros are well made, the lamb is cut just right. The chicken schwarma is on point and the jalape u00f1o cilantro hummus is outrageously delicious nThe owner of this place is really a nice guy and the prices are great! nThanks for the 10 off when we checked it too!",2
Great little park for your kids and also two separate dog parks. The parking is usually pretty easy to find and the walking trails are a nice change of pace!,2
"We decided to check out this place for a drink or 2 while waiting for Bianco. Eh.the inside was so hot.they couldn't find the remotes to the ceiling fans, really? . My husband got a draft beet and I went with bottled, both were room temp. We gave them another chance or ordered another round, both were warm again. The limes for my beer were crusty and gross. I didn't even want to think about eating here if they can't keep the beer cold what is the cooler like? n nNext time we are waiting at Bianco we will stay at Bar Bianco where the keep the beer cold!",1
"Had so much fun and this local dive bar! We stayed close by at the Saguaro resort and we were looking for a place to listen to some live country music. So, we jumped on our trusty Yelp app and found the Rusty Spur. Cheap drinks, a packed house, and some great live country music.and dancing! it made for the perfect night out in old town Scottsdale. If when we return to the area we will make sure to stop in here again. n nWe got here around 730 and definitely beat the entire crowd haha but by around 930 10 it was packed n nThe band takes request and they also make sure to let the crowd know that they take tips haha it's well worth it though!",2
"YUM! This place is good. Fried pickles, Rotisserie Chicken, cole slaw! nI did not try the fried chicken and waffles but saw many having it and smiling so it must have been good. Recommend!",2
"I wish I could say something positive about this place, but my experience with this place has been horrible thus far. nMy husband and I were looking for a new camper, we found one we liked and started the financing process. We were getting a great deal and this particular fifth wheel would fit our life style well. A week later we went through our own bank to finance and picked a date to pick up our new used fifth wheel. The Wed. before we were to pick it up we called to see if we could pick it up a day earlier and were promptly told no, that there were no open appointments that day.and that the main awning motor was missing so they took it upon themselves to remove the awning without even a phone call to us. After a day and a half of phone tag and much negotiation we agreed to pay half of the cost of a new motor and the labor to instal, i mean did i really need that 500? nThe day of the trade in we showed up at our appointment time, signed a bunch of papers and were taken to our new home on wheels, there was a technician there to do a walk through with us, and we knew more about the unit then he did, awesome. I asked him how long the unit had been on the lot, he told me 3 years, the salesman told me 8 months. When it was time to transfer our stuff from our old camper to the new one, no one was there to reposition the new trailor so we had to move boxes one by one across a parking lot, which at first glance doesnt sound so bad, but in hour 2 it suck. Before we left the sales manager approached me and told me that they had ""miss placed "" the keys to the unit and for me to call a locksmith have the locks rekeyed, to send them the reciept and they will reemberse me, we will see if that really happens. nWe get the rv home, and the water heater isnt working, lights have shorted out, the cieling fan wont turn on and there are cob webs.wth. we were told everything was checked and worked, and that the unit was detailed. nNeedless to say when we purchase our next rv it will not be from these people.",1
This is my favorite pizza place in Vegas. I've probably ate here about 10 15 times in the last 7 years. I just love how cheesy it is and hot crispy the crust is. If you are around Circus Circus you have to try the pizza. Price is good and size is good. They fill it up with toppings. Service is good also.,2
"Roaches, horrible service and a sub par pedicure. I won a gift certificate to this place in a raffle so thought I'd give it a shot. My pedi guy was unfriendly and just kept his earbuds in so he could listen to music on his phone. My pedicure is barely average. When he was done, he walked me over to sit while my toes dried but didn't even bother to turn on the UV light. He never came back to check on me. After I saw my 2nd roach, I was out of there. NEVER AGAIN! I wish I could this give this place ZERO stars!",1
"Visiting from LA. Went to this pace based on the Yelp positive feedback. nHard to believe the ratings. Early Friday dinner, not crowded yet took nearly 45 minutes for an order of ravioli and a small pizza. nThe there was the bland taste. Ever so slightly better than big box chain Whitewash Italian. Pizza crust tuff, as if old or overworked. No sauce to speak of and overly cheesy. Ravioli on the hard side of al dente, nearly tasteless meat filling. n nOn the positive side, the staff were very friendly and apologetic on the long wait. Perhaps locals prioritize service over food. Otherwise visitors should go elsewhere.",1
"The hotel room was fine. It's a little older, but it's ok. We usually stay here for the pool and normally I'm happy with this hotel. However this time I am very upset. I was in Vegas to get married and most of my guests booked rooms the Flamingo. My mom rented a Cabana in the family pool which cost her 500 plus alcohol. What makes me angry is that the adult pool had a special DJ so they were charging 20 to get in. Also because of this special guest DJ they blocked off the hot tubs and other parts of the family pool. My mom wanted to get in the hot tub and was told no. I'm sorry, but you did not tell us when we booked this cabana that we would not have full access to the pool and spa. I think it's ridiculous that you would charge someone 500 and not tell them that they would have limited access. You could have told us when we booked the cabana. Instead you were happy to take our money and block us from the pool. Nice. n nAdditionally, my groom booked a cabana on the adult side for the Friday before. When my mom called to book her cabana they told her the adult cabana was also 500 for Friday. I called two days later and was told the same thing. When my groom called the next day to book the cabana they were like too bad so sad. There are only 2 cabanas left so we just jacked the price up to 800. n nMy family and friends spent close to 10,000 between rooms, cabanas, food and drink at the Flamingo alone and that is how we get treated. n nAlso, even on floors higher than 17 don't plan to sleep before 3 am because the Mexican restaurant plays dance music so loud you can hear the lyrics that high up and feel the bass rattle your room.",1
"My fellow Leithers rave about Word of Mouth, but I live but a hop, skip and a jump away from the Bonnington Brunch so my breakfast roll allegiances lie there. However, as the Brunch staff have recently selfishly decided that Sundays should be a day of rest, I'm without a caf u00e9 to supply me with sausage rolls on the Sabbath. So far I've just restricted my breakfast roll habit to a Saturday, but as I recently had guests staying over who were in need of meat and bread I made the trip to Word of Mouth. n nAlas! I have been spoilt by the Brunch's super cheap prices, and was aghast to see that Word of Mouth charged about u00a33.50 for a roll with 3 fillings, and about u00a32 I can't remember exactly, might have been anywhere between u00a31.80 and u00a32.20 for one filling. That is an expensive roll when I'm used to a base price of u00a31.40 plus 40p per extra item. n nFortunately the quality of said rolls just about justifies the expense. These are ciabatta rolls the owner said he much prefers them to normal bread ones , and the quality of the sausages, bacon, eggs etc is wonderful. Delicious. A bit mean to cut the link sausages in half so you actually only get 2 sausages in your roll, but tasty at least. n nNow it only takes me a little over 10 minutes to walk there, but I feel that's too long to be walking back while my food is getting cold, so my trips there in future will be restricted to either sitting in or the rare occasions such as last weekend when I have the use of a car. And the vast difference in cost between it and the Brunch means I'll really only make the journey when I NEED a breakfast roll. But, the caf u00e9 itself looks lovely so it may well be that I'll be back soon but for a sit in lunch this time.",2
"39 cent tacos special normally 69 each . Crunchy shells, mildly spiced ground beef. n nIn the Lowe's parking lot. Drive thru convenience or eat in. n nCheap, fast, friendly. Sometimes that's what you are after.",1
"Honestly, the only reason I come to this location is because of how close it is to my house but I think I'll have to be finding a new location. My boyfriend and I waited 3 minutes at the order window after being told it would be just a moment, and then another 15 minutes to get our drinks with one vehicle at the pick up window in front of us. Once we got to the window, I got my tea and we had to wait an additional 3 minutes for our fizzio. No apologies for the wait. Unfortunately, I've found that this has become characteristic of this location. As far as the drinks go, my chai was good as usual, but we would not recommend the fizzio. It's not terrible but it does have a bad aftertaste. One star is because customer service really does make or break the experience, and this location seriously lacks quality service. I still love you though Starbucks!",1
Went here looking for something on a Wedding Registry and to have them take off some items we bought at a much cheaper price elsewhere. The store was not laid out well and was not very clean and lots of the inventory was gone. The lady that helped me wasn't very helpful at all she said she couldn't take the items I already purchased off the registry and she only looked in back for the one item I was looking for she didn't even check in nearby stores. The Macy's Home store on Spring Mountain Road was much better. I will never come here again.,1
"Came here on the strength of the generally positive reviews. The comments about staff friendliness, attentiveness as well as the variety and flavor of the beers is all true. n nUnfortunately so too are comments about the food. The hummus and goat cheese, cleverly presented in tubes was okay. The tofu steak I ordered was burnt. Prices are reasonable. Overall impression, if you are planning to come here for the beer, I think you will be pleased. If you're planning to dine there is the potential you will be disappointed.",1
"This is not a Chinese restaurant, but rather a loud middle aged bar that happens to serve Chinese food. Food was mediocre, service was lousy and it is not the right venue for the percussion heavy live music they provide.",1
"We were waiting 15 min for someone serve us, and then 10 min for ordering food, the coming 20 min for food cooking and came out no napkin no silverware but a rush guy threw the dish on the table then left.

I mentioned this place to my hubby once or twice. On my bday he delivered! I was soooo excited! The food was excellent and so was the service! I definitely recommend this place to any and everyone! There are so many different options to choose from there is definitely something for everyone!,2

"Wanted to like Clever Koi more than I did, and maybe I'm a bit too picky regarding Asian fusion and certain flavors, but my dish was only. alright, and my tablemate's dish was insanely, INSANELY salty, nearly to the point of inedibility. I believe she had the tofu kimchi fried rice, but I don't remember exactly. n nWe had a couple other misses that night dishes that had potential but whose specific execution made them a bit too strong in one direction and not well rounded or enjoyable as full meals, and the place was slammed so service was a bit slow. n nI had the Chicken Katsu, which was alright, but the nori was a bit off putting next to fried chicken for me. Typically a meal I'm not crazy about would net a 3 star, but three out of four of us were unimpressed overall, and my friends are nowhere near as picky as I am. They just didn't love the specific executions they were served.",1
The club was really spacious. You didn't feel like you were confined to two areas. It was fun dancing on the water.,2
"I have been to the Southern many times but there had been a long gap until I revisited last night. n nUnfortunately I was very disappointed. My two favourite dishes that I usually choose from when I visit The Southern, The Red Squirrel or Holyrood 9A are the Halloumi burger or the Haggis burger. Last night I went for halloumi. n nWhen it arrived I instantly noticed that there was a fair bit less halloumi in than I have had on previous visits. Not only that but it was considerably burnt. The bun was also incredibly crusty and flaked everywhere. I ate most of it because I was starving. n nWhen the waitress came along to clear our table she asked if everything was OK so i told her my halloumi was burnt, she went and gave my feedback to the chef then gave us 10 off our bill. This was a very decent gesture and I do like the place. The food was simply just not up to scratch. n nI will return if I'm in the neighbourhood and hopefully things will improve.",1
"I love the vig and the laidback but highclass atmosphere they present there. The breakfast in manhattan martini doesn't play around, it has woodford reserve bourbon shaken with fresh apple juice and syrup! It has shredded bacon lining the rim of this intoxicating drink. The only reason I gave them a 4 is because I ordered my steak Med Rare and it came out Medium and even more dry than a medium should be.",2
"My family ate at the Wynn Buffet just before Christmas in 2008 and enjoyed it very much.

Absolutely the best place to get a delicious Reuben and brew fries in town! My favorite dive on the Eastside of Madison.,2
"Went there for lunch with some coworkers. Surprised that there was no one there as it was 12 10pm, prime lunch time. Ordered the bacon cheese burger with sweet potatoe fries with a drink for about 11 bucks. The burger was great! The bun was delicious and everything complemented each other. The sweet potatoe fries were equally good, nice and hot. Only complaint would be the price as 11 bucks for burger fries and drink is a bit excessive in my book.",2
"Better than the reviews for 2012 hands down. It seems like they should have a separate page for each year. We spent in total about 60 for the 2 of us admission, food, shared a beer n nIf you don't want to wait in the massive line for tickets buy them online. Than you can go straight to the gate.

The polish sausage with lobster Mac and cheese is a revelation. Go here. Now. n nArizona farms cheese curds. Better than anything I ever got in the Midwest. They have this wonderful garlicky flavor that is so awesome. If you really love them get 2 smalls for 4 each instead of 1 large for 8 as it is barely any bigger than the small. Literally the container is maybe 1 4 "" bigger. n nThere were groupon and livingsocial deals for tickets so we got 2 GA tix for 13. great! They sell out quick so act fast n nParking was free and pretty well coordinated. Yes you will wait in line. n nThe bad n nThe porta potties. Whole new level of disgusting. n nNot many food trucks had things for 1 token. Most had a small side fries etc that didn't really showcase the food trucks fare for about 2 tokens 4 but to get anything good was about 4 5 tokens 8 10 . the thing is they still gave sample portions so it adds up quickly! Some were the exception but this was true of the 10 12 trucks our group went to. n nNot much shelter or shade. Normally in January this isn't an issue and i saw reviews of last year it was really cold but it was pretty toasty this year! n nBeer selection. Coors, bud, blue moon, and redd ale. C'mon guys.

"I really recommend checking this out if you've not been here. It used to be sorry a total dive but in a good way. It often opens until 3am and the quality of drunk you get in here is something else.

"So my friend and I were looking all over for a nice boba place. We went everywhere from tea station to volcano tea, but they were all crowded with no place to sit. nSo we decided to try out Tiffany. nAt first when I walked in, I was baffled by the large selection of drinks or at least it felt like that to me. nI was staring at the menu for a long time but decided to try the sweet potato latte because it was so unique to me. nAnd wow I was surprised. It had real sweet potato in the drink and was tasty. nIt can be served hot or cold so don't be afraid to try it on a hot summer day or cold winter day. nThe employees were also very friendly. My friend wanted some boonguhbbang, but the portion was too large for her. The employees gave her free ones since those weren't made correctly, but they tasted great anyways just a bit off colored and a bit too fat for a normal one lol nI think this is going to be my favorite tea coffee boba place to hang out now.",2

"This is like the other Sierra Golds. The happy hour is probably your best option. n nThe pizzas are half off for happy hour and all drinks are 50 off. Of course they just raise the regular prices but atleast it is reasonably priced with the discount. you have to have a beer and bites card to get the discount. That card does make your visit seem corporate and impersonable. I guess Vegas has changed. ""sigh. "" n nThe pizzas are suprisingly good. Not in the traditional pizza way because the crust is more like a cracker than real pizza dough. even though it is not tradional pizza it still tastes pretty good. n nThis particular location seems busier than other Sierra Golds. It had a pretty good crowd there lively but not too lively.",2

"My sisters and I went to Hanny's for my birthday this past weekend. After reading multiple reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I was a little concerned and not sure if I wanted to go to Hanny's after all. We walked in about 10 00pm and the restaurant was busy! We were instantly ushered to our table. Nice! Our waitress was great and our food was delicious and quickly served. 5 martinis? Heck Yeah! We're going back this weekend!",2

"This was my first visit here. Having heard about it, I had wanted to try the place out for some time now. Here's the scenario n nWe arrived at the parking garage and stopped at the parking attendant booth, where we had to pay the 5.00 parking fee refundable in full if validated in the hotel . Went inside the hotel and found Island Sushi Hawaiian Grill. I noted their sign at the entrance of the restaurant informed potential customers that an 18 gratuity would automatically be added to the bill for a party of 6 or more. I thought that ""six "" was quite a small party for an 18 gratuity, but oh well. Luckily for us, we were a party of two. n nI ordered the Hawaiian Breakfast which came with a scoop of sticky rice this was very good , Hawaiian sweet bread just OK , kalua pig dry, hard, and needed salt , 2 eggs I ordered ""easy over "" , and lomi tomato never heard of lomi tomato, so I asked our waiter about the salmon in the lomi tomato. He confirmed that it's only tomato.no salmon . Hubby ordered fried saimin which was very tasty . n nIn a reasonable amount of time, our orders arrived pictures posted and I quickly noticed that my over easy eggs were much too well done.overly fried. The kalua pig needed salt but it was edible. Some parts of the kalua pig were tender, but mostly the pig was hard and tough. You need to have strong jaws to finish all the pork on your plate! The lomi tomato was good, considering there was no salmon in this dish. Sticky rice very good. I tried my best to eat the rubbery eggs but I had to ask for another set of over easy eggs. When the 2nd set of eggs came, it was barely different from the first set. The 2nd set of eggs were again equally burned on the bottom, but at least now the yolks were soft and liquidy. I guess their chef only knows how to cremate eggs instead of gently frying them under low heat. Amazing. n nOh and by the way, I didn't know it but if you Check In with Yelp while you're at the restaurant, they will give you a 15 discount. No one told me about this discount. I was pleasantly surprised when I did a Check In on Yelp while waiting for our food to arrive. n nAfter our meal we did go over to the Cashier and got our 5.00 parking fee refunded. n nOK so I've been here, done that. n nP.S. Our bill amounted to 17.36 which included the 15 discount from Yelp. I gave them a 20.00 bill and another food server came back with my change of 17.00. Quite astonishing, when I expected to receive 2.00 and some change. I called her over to our table and explained the erroneous change I received. She went back to the cashier, this time returning with the correct change, and she thanked me.",1
"If I could give NEGATIVE stars,I would! One of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time! Very disappointed in Romano's. n nRight from the moment we walked in, hostess said it would only be a few minutes no problem, EXCEPT that I counted at least a dozen empty tables those were the ones I could actually see. While waiting, the kitchen staff proceeded to slam pots whatever else at a deafening sound to where we could not hear ourselves talk. Do they not realize that they are open to the dining area? n nWhile being seated I commented to the hostess that the place seemed disorganized. She said they had a new manager who didn't know the routine yet AND they weren't expecting the winter visitors so soon. REALLY? Are you stupid? IT'S NOVEMBER? I didn't need to hear this and found it unprofessional. n nWe waited 10 min before anyone noticed us. A waiter came over and took drink orders, which we received quickly, but no sugar or silverware. We were ready to order but could not get the waiter's attention. I got up and found silverware and sugar on my own. Finally, our orders were taken but no bread. After 20 min I got up and went in search of the guy wearing a tie, who I presumed was the manager. I told him ""20 min and no bread ""! He brought us some about 5 min later. Our drinks were never refilled or even asked if we wanted them refilled! n nWhen dinners were served, waiter did not offer ground pepper or grated cheese. I got up AGAIN, at this point they may have thought I worked here , and tracked down a grated cheese caddy that had been left on a sideboard. Now the waiter shows up to see if we wanted grated cheese! n nThe meals were delicious but we had to contend with loud music which made it impossible to converse. This is a ITALIAN restaurant why not play some pleasing Italian tenor music instead if something we would find at a club. We were not planning on dancing on the table. Again, no drink refills, even though our glasses were empty at this point. n nI could watch our waiter run to tables all over the restaurant which made no sense to me. The wait staff did not look particularly happy and appeared instead like they were just racing through the motions to get through the night. n nWe needed take home containers and waited another 15 min at this point I was timing everything . Finally, the waiter brought them and said they ran out of take out containers and had to buy some at Pei Wei. ? Is this supposed to be funny? They were pitiful containers too. n n SIGH . We didn't want to take a chance of the waiter disappearing again so we asked for the bill at this time also. n nI guess the bill was also manufactured at Pei Wei. Guess again another 15 min to get the bill and when the server brought it over, he brought new glasses of iced tea! At this point we thought it was just comical. nInstead of waiting again, we tracked down the waiter to pay the bill. n nCould not get out if there fast enough. We wished 'good luck' to everyone waiting to be seated again, with lots of EMPTY tables . n nThis location needs HELP FAST! The GM needs to get his her butt in here and TRAIN. This experience seemed like a place that is on the verge of closing. Don't they realize that there is tons of competition in DESERT RIDGE? No one needs to put up with this.",1
"This is one of the first noodle joints I had tried in Charlotte and have stuck with since the opening of many more around the area. n nI'll keep my review to the point. It has noodles from the major regions of the world and you choose the meat or veggie that you want. This location is a fairly decent size, but I wouldn't imagine bringing a huge group inside. n nThe food I always end up getting is of good quality and freshness. I've never had a bad experience here, hence, the reason why I keep coming back. Their udon noodle and pad thai isn't too bad if you're looking for a quick fix, but not the best for sure. Fairly decent pricing, depending on what meat you usually get. Waiting staff is courteous and prompt and always willing to make things right.",2
Slow service and messed up orders. I don't know if they didn't expect the crowd they had.,1
"For the person who knows what they are looking for where to find it, this place will be your living hell. n nAs you walk down the aisle, Sales Associates will pop out at you every 3 feet to ask if you need help.

"" My stress level highly increases whenever I walk into Buy Buy Baby. Then, once you go to the ""Self Serve "" wrapping station, there will always be a middle aged woman hovering over you trying to hand you ribbons, no thank you, I've got it. n nThe only good thing about this store is the selection, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but I would never register here in a million years!",1

"Truly disappointed! Got the Scotch Egg. Very plain. Ale Onion Soup, plain. We waited with each item coming out. Over an hour after we sat we finally got our meal. I got the lamb rack asked for medium, came out rare no seasons. I had to add salt and pepper. The baby carrots were good and seasoned well and the mac'n cheese was good. I told them 3 times it was my husbands birthday. The waiter came over after we ate and delivery of the check with all kinds of small talk.I plan to never eat here again.",1
"Very friendly, warm atmosphere. Excellent coffee. Carrot and coriander soup very good. Breakfast sausage sandwich simple but tasty.",2
"This place is all right. Just all right. Bordering on whatevs. We were there in middle afternoon so it was probably a little more quiet than it gets on a Saturday evening. The spinning wheel for drink specials is okay. Though it didn't really work for us. When we came in, specials on Dos Equis. Sweet. Refreshing. Good with the nachos et cetera. Next was Jack Daniels. I love whiskey, but not a great combo. And certainly not appreciated by my table mates. n nFun gimmick, but I've been to these places where . . like, several choices are on special. Maybe if each section of the wheel included a beer and a liquor selection. n nThe guacamole wasn't unholy, but it also wasn't great. We were pretty sure it was that fairly decent stuff you can get in the frozen section of Costco. The nachos were fine. The chicken on there was nicely seasoned and not too dry. The empanadas were good, a little less so for the price. n nIt is big and wide open, has a nice view of the strip. You can have fun here. You can also probably be slightly disappointed here.",1
So happy there's a 2nd location in Scottsdale. Luv the drinks! Fun atmosphere! Luv the vegan options!,2
At the place right now. 20 minutes and no one has even come to our table. No water. Nothing. I'm a waitress and this is by far THE WORST SERVICE EVER! They obviously don't care about customer service what so ever. No one has acknowledged how awful the service has been. Food was room temperature. Super angry. Fail! Oh and of course it's super expensive. I hate it so much.,1
"This is a great place for breakfast, although it gets pretty crowded and parking can be a nightmare. n nSolid kitchen, good dish selection, all in all a great place. n nWhy 4 stars? A little too pricey for what you get.",2
Amazing soup. Fresh hand made noodles. it was perfect.,2
This restaurant is now closed and was replaced by a place called NaNos,1
"This place was better when the hotel was Barbary Coast they had better late night specials. Don't get me wrong, 5.99 is awesome for steak eggs, but what happened to the 4.00 two eggs special. n nThere were four people in our party, we only had two place settings. When I attempted to ask the server for two more, he kept walking away. I asked for a medium steak, it came well done. I didn't want to complain, because well, it was only 5.99 and I didn't want to chance getting spit in my food. n nAlso, while I was at the host podium waiting to give my name. The host put down the clipboard on the podium and turned around really fast to talk to someone. The clipboard starting falling and I tried to save it but it fell on his feet. I'm pretty sure he thought I knocked it over. He gave me a look, and I felt like I was getting blamed for his own clumsiness and stupidity.",1
"Six of us had lunch at Chelsea Grill in Oakmont. I ordered my blue cheese hamburger to be cooked medium. While it was large, the meat was very well done. The blue cheese was in some thick green sauce that oozed out of the bun like it was salad dressing. I hated the taste which made me shudder, I hated it so much. I scraped most of the sauce off the meat and the bun. I was very hungry, but never finished even a half of the burger and refused a carry out for the other half. The fries are the kind that have a flour costing which crisps up in the fryer but I prefer fries without any coating. My husband loves hot stuffed banana peppers. He said that if there's a rating system of one to ten, he would rate them a one for awful. He ate the peppers but could not stand the filling which had no sausage but what he thought was a rice bread filling. The other Adult had a chicken salad sandwich was ok. They do not give free refills for children's' drinks. The cups for the kids were the smallest cups I have ever seen a restaurant have for children. With ice, I bet there was no more than 4 5 oz. of liquid in each cup. Then waitress saw that I ate hardly any of my lunch, but never asked if I was unhappy with the food. We should have just gone to Oakmont Bakery next door and had a pastry and coffee. We would have enjoyed our food and not wasted our money.",1
"The Spice Pavilion is my go to Indian Restaurant in Edinburgh. The welcome you get from Christina is warm and the staff are friendly. Service is attentive but not in your face. Every time I go I have difficulty choosing what I want to eat, everything sounds delicious, and for veggies there is a good choice of curries as well i.e well thought out veggie curries, not meat curries without the meat! There are a good range of starters and sides as well as naan breads! If you have room for dessert you must try the Kulfi, its so tasty!",2
"Honestly, the Crystal Corner is about the best example of a neighborhood bar I can think of. Great taps, comfortable feel and quick and competent bartenders are the norm here. n nI can still remember the first time I went my friend and I had just turned 21 and we were exploring the non State Street parts of Madison for the first time. My buddy's father must have heard the same things about the Crystal because he told us to ""never go to that place people get killed there! "" So of course we went and the warnings of imminent demise proved incorrect. For a neighborhood bar the Crystal Corner is remarkably friendly which for me is the be all end all. I've always found the insular nature of some places off putting the ""swivel factor "" of regulars looking you over when you walk in is an immediate strike against for me. That's why the Crystal Corner is the best, because the atmosphere here is the perfect mix of casual, friendly and fun. n nIf it were just a comfortable place to hang out the Crystal would still be one of my favorites in Madison. But the reason I think the Crystal is a five star joint is because of the great live music. I've gone to shows here both large and small sometimes the place has been so packed that I've watched the band from across the bar. Most shows tend to be a bit more low key, with plenty of room and good sightlines. I wouldn't have ever thought it, but looking back on the last five years I've got to say a couple of my favorite shows have been at the Crystal. And last but certainly not least , this place is frickin' famous Okkervil River namechecks the Crystal Corner in ""A Girl In Port "". So they've got that going for them, which is nice.",2
I just turned 47 years old and I'm a fat chick not just a little bit of a fat chick.a fat fat chick and for me to walk away from the table and leave a sausage patty and 2 bacon sitting on the plate with one bite taken out of the bacon and had to spit that ut into a napkin has to tell you how unbelievably a this breakfast was this morning so awful I am dumbfounded at this point. The meat was rancid it has gone bad probably a day or two ago and they had pre cooked it and you can taste it being sour and rancid. Like I said be worse breakfast ever in my life.,1
"I go to the movies an average of 5 times per week yes, you read that correctly but this theater makes my blood boil. I only go here to see a movie as a last resort. I don't know if it's because of the location and all those Summerlin elitists think they are more important than the rest of us, but this theater has the worst problem with talking and audience behavior than anywhere else I have ever seen a movie. Is everybody at Red Rock drinking rude juice? n nI have never seen a film here where the audience didn't yap the entire way through it and I have even been in the theater when there were only 2 other people in there and damn if they didn't talk the whole time too! I've reported this to the manager SEVERAL times. The response I always get is the same ""I understand. "" That's it! Well if you UNDERSTAND, then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Kick the people out! Help save our sanity! No, I don't want a refund or a free ticket, I want to be able to see a movie IN PEACE AND QUIET with an audience that isn't full of rude, crude and socially unacceptable people! n nI've politely voiced my concern with three different managers at the theater, over a dozen employees, and even with Regal Cinemas corporate headquarters. I've had the manager personally call me on the phone twice. That's nice, but still nothing has been done to address the behavior. It is rampant at this theater and it is the worst. n nI've had people carry on full volume conversations, answer their cell phones, make phone calls, repeat nearly every line in the movie, refuse to take their screaming infants out to the lobby, and have their 2 year old toddlers RUN AROUND and hit the back of seats during an R rated movie. Yep, twice! I have gotten up during the movie, left the auditorium and gone out to alert an employee. Why should I have to be punished and made to leave the film to go get somebody to help enforce audience behavior? Each time the employees haven't given a crap about it. On that note, why the hell are small children even ALLOWED in an R rated movie, EVER?!? What's next, little Billy gets his eyes full at ""Blue Is The Warmest Color? "" n nI refuse to go here ever again. This last time was the last straw. My blood pressure just went up 30 points from writing this review because it makes me so angry to think about this theater. AVOID at all costs.",1
"We went there with a friend for dinner. This was a big mistake. I ordered baby back ribs. All dishes came with a side order of salad. Later on, when all other dishes came with a side of potato and vegetable, to my astonishment, my plate was a huge white plate with some ribs at the middle of it and a piece of lemon on the side! I don't know what was the purpose of the lemon. Was I supposed to add it to the ribs that had barbecue sauce on it? No potatoes, no vegetables, nothing else. It looked like something you put in front of a dog. nIn addition, the waitress was rude. It seemed like she was offended that I didn't touch the food. This was a huge waste of money. We will never ever go back there again.",1

"Flew Southwest Airlines two times before between Phoenix and LAX and once to Austin. Both flights from Phoenix to LAX were delayed one hour. Fortunately I usually plan for this sort of thing so I was OK with connecting to my international flight at LAX, but I'm sure others weren't so lucky. Plus, on the flight to Austin one of the flight attendants sang country songs and told inappropriate jokes about men and her husband over the loudspeaker for about 10 minutes 15 minutes. Some of the more ""goofy "" passengers actually seemed to enjoy ""the show. "" But I prefer my airlines to stick to air travel and not comedy or music. Plus, what about those people that want to get some sleep or read? Why would they want to be subjected to this juvenile krap? Plus you can't select your seat before the flight. You have to stand in line like cattle at the gate in ""boarding groups "" and then when your group is called to board fight off others to get a good seat. I'm a big guy so I usually win, but what about the little people?! LOL. Plus, I don't like the stress of knowing I'm gonna have to do battle with others to get a decent seat. n nFor these reasons I haven't flown Southwest since 2008 and have only flown US Airways domestically.",1
"it was difficult to get to this place, and ppl are terrible at giving directions to first timers. nbut i can't remember now what floor it was on, but you go through few security ppl. you get your stamp from the store right in front after you get off the escalators once you get that you enter through the security check pt to the elevators into the pool you're greeted.

"Well, at least I can say I understand why this restaurant is called Forget. After eating here, I wish I could forget the experience. I first came across this restaurant when I visited Montreal for the first time with my parents. We were planning to have dinner here until a torrential downpour sidetracked that idea. I was not as fortunate to avoid this place the second time around. My friends and I took a day trip to Montreal this past weekend and we decided to come here for dinner. We were met by the same hostess who convincingly tried to seat us at one of their many vacant tables on the patio. That was probably the first warning sign to avoid this place. Nonetheless, we wanted some authentic French food so we gave it a shot. n nThe menu was expensive, but I thought high prices were intrinsic to French cuisine. They had an appealing three course meal, which came with a soup of the day or smal salad and tea or coffee that accompanied the main entree. I decided to go with the chicken supreme, which turned out to be the complete opposite of supreme. The soup of the day was cream tomato soup, which came hot, but somewhat too acidic for my taste. I did have a taste of my friend's gazpacho soup, which was refreshing, albeit resembling more of a chilled salsa soup than anything. Then came the driest piece of chicken that I've ever tasted. It looked grilled and the thickness was about four inches. There's no way you could grill a chicken breast that thick, but they somehow managed to do it incorrectly . The outer layer was inedible and the only slightly edible portion was the very middle. The orange sauce was decent, but no amount of sauce could save that chicken breast. In addition, the vegetables were steamed to a mush and the potatoes were unimpressive. n nOn top of that, we were given the bill without being offered coffee or tea until we asked. And to top off our inglorious meal, a giant spider dropped down on my hand. I think it's safe to say this was one of the worst meals I've had for the price I paid. Please let me forget Restaurant Forget.",1

"Hubby was very excited to find out Lobster Me had opened but he didn't stay happy long. The original Maine roll at 17.00 was about the going rate he said but nowhere near the quality of a Fords Fish Shack. Fords would have never served overcooked lobster! I got fish and chips and at 12.00 it has to be the biggest ripoff on the menu. I got a vat of fries and 3 rectangles of fish that were about the size of the Trident brand fish sticks in the grocery frozen section, I got mine with ranch instead of tartar sauce but their ranch was not good. I was happy to try something new but I liked this spot better when the coffee bean and tea leaf was still there. We most definitely won't be returning.",1
"Last Sunday I visited the club as a guest of a member. First of all I would like to say this is the nicest health club I have ever been to in my life. The facility is immaculate, employees are friendly and helpful, locker room has everything you would ever need and the work out room has top of the line equipment. If I lived in Scottsdale I would get a membership asap and go there on a daily basis. I belong to a small club in L.A. and now I feel jaded.",2
"There's absolutely no reason to eat here unless it's the only place that's open.and even then you may want to rethink your options. n nService by the wait staff was fine.friendly and fairly attentive.service from the kitchen was quite slow.More importantly, the food was just plain 'blah'. And at 20 a head for breakfast it should be a lot better than 'blah'.",1
"BYO in Mile End that I tucked into for a friend's bday dinner last week and couldn't have been happier to find myself in such a cozy port in the 30 storm. We sat in the shoes off elevated area surrounded by big pillows beneath the billowing tapestries that patchwork the ceiling. Water was served in cool glass carafes, wine bottles popped, bowls of hot dahl served, and then giant stoneware dishes, one vegetarian, one chicken, one veal which I didn't try but folks raved over. The chicken was moist and slightly spicy and the vegetarian had lip smackingly good potatoes. After the meal we were served hot sweet mint tea that was a perfect kick back out the door into the cold. n nThe restaurant was short staffed that night so the owner was cooking and serving and he did an amazing job juggling it all with a smile. We paid a flat 20 each plus tax which seemed like a fair deal for the massive mounts of meal and the great good vibes.",2
"I don't know why this place is so highly rated and raved about. One of the most disappointing buffets I've had in Vegas and I've tried almost all of them . The type of food is higher notch than most Vegas buffets. Items like BBQ shrimp with grits, pappardelle noodles with beef, lamb ragout, gnoochi with shrimp, roasted lamb, even bone marrow. Although the items were of a more gourmet taste, the flavors of almost all the dishes were completely lacking. They had the right idea but it's just not executed well. My entire party agreed that almost all the food was bland. The only saving grace was the dessert buffet. The desserts were very good and the gelato was great. For around 45 per person, the Wynn buffet is a far better option.",1
"It's tucked back in the corner of a shopping plaza, kinda just hanging out, waiting for someone to find it. It's worth finding. n nFinally got some time to meet up with Elite Emily, so we chose this place because who doesn't love some good pastrami? Terrorists, that's who. We, however, are not terrorists, so we went to check out this place in Henderson. n nThe main downside is that it's small. Like, ""get there early or prepare to wait "" small. Our wait time wasn't too bad, but with the cramped seating, I can see it filling up very quickly and not relenting. Also, even in our early CENSORED we definitely skewed the age range downward. n nSuck it up, Soldier Sassypants, because this is some serious deli pwnge, Elite Emily went with the Soup Sandwich combo, but the Matzo Ball Soup dominated so that way when she got to the sandwich, it was almost time to throw in the towel. My Pastrami Burger was so big I'm fairly sure you could have put little french fry legs and made it into a scene stealing Disney sidekick. But it was delicious though, so it wouldn't have lasted long. Because I would have eaten it. And possibly burped. TMI. n nThe meat was done just right, with just the right seasonings to go with it, and the pastrami was shaved so thin while still being piled high and tender. Add a little deli mustard, oy, it's like buttah. You'll develop shpilkis in your genechtagazoink. n nService was friendly, if a little rushed I mean, granted, we were thirsty, but ya didn't have to bring the whole pitcher of Pepsi over . Definitely a hidden gem worth finding. n nYou can meet me there. We'll nosh, we'll talk, no big whoop.",2
"I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for this place! I have been coming to Aloha Specialties since I was a kid. My dad was born in Hawaii so we are always on the hunt for some good local food. Aloha Specialties is one of the must eats when my family or bf comes to Vegas. n nI usually get the Garlic Chicken and Ahi Poke when they have it . The garlic chicken is a pretty hefty plate with three breaded and fried chicken thighs slathered with brown gravy. I love anything with brown gravy and I like my dark meat. Like I said, a heavy meal. take a nap after eating this. The ahi poke is on the specials list and isn't always there. If you see it you should get it! Large hunks of fresh tuna and onion soaked in sesame oil and soy sauce goes great with a bowl of plain white rice. Better than sushi! It is always a bummer when they run out or don't have any poke. My brother is a big fan of their Loco Moco. Too much hamburger meat for me but he loves it. I usually get a fruit punch to wash it all down and complete my local style lunch or dinner. n nThe hours are kinda limited for a Vegas eatery. they close at 9pm or 10pm. Be safe and come for a yummy lunch. If you are still on the prowl for some good local food in the wee hours after dancing your butt off at a club, I would head downstairs to the 24 hour Market Street Cafe for some dang good Oxtail soup. The Cal has it all! Lotsa good food for a great price. If you have relatives from Hawaii like I do, you may run into them gambling the slots downstairs. Say hi to Auntie for me!",2
"My poor old dog Buddy was feeling empty nest and empty pack syndrome when my son moved away and took his dog with him. Let's just say it was not a mild case of separation anxiety. I tried bringing in another dog, taking him to a friend's house, even a bark collar. He was not happy. until I took him to ""the club. "" He stares at me in the morning while I'm packing my lunch like he's saying ""Hurry up, I want to go play with my friends! "" He gets so excited even when we're 3 blocks away. He literally runs to the door when I drop him off. I can even get him groomed and his nails trimmed while he's there. I have my happy dog back! Best money I ever spent!",2
"I really REALLY wanted to love this place. I've stayed at almost every hotel in Vegas, so I'm fairly in touch with the hospitality situation there. This hotel was very hit and miss. It seems like it was rushed, without much thought to design and detail. Here are the highs and lows n nPROS n Very attentive and friendly staff at the front desk n The Griddle is the best breakfast in town n The main casino bar is flanked by an amazing LED screen n Plastic bed lights up. VERY cool! n nCONS n Location not near anything n I requested a non down comforter three times over the course of two days and it never showed up. n Main casino bar is small and always mobbed and nowhere to sit. n Rooms are industrial chic, and feel that way. Cold, charmless. n The sink, bathroom and shower use sliding doors to access, a sloppy design. n The Griddle line is already insane 20 mins every morning minimum once word gets out about this place, forget it. n Bar by reception closed at midnight. REALLY? n Pool scene is weak n nI cannot recommend this hotel and don't quite understand why anyone would want to stay here when there are so many better hotels on the strip for the same or lesser price.",1
Great place for the kids. There is not much to do in Las Vegas. This place is a God sent,2
I totally forgot how amazing Wendy's was. It literally felt like sex in my mouth. This place is the best place to go to if you're in a rush and starving. Their value menu is perfect. Something about their frostees keep me coming back. I think it's because it's so thick and creamy. I absolutely love them! n nI came here for a quick lunch with my sister and mom. To my surprise we only spent about 9. We sure did get our money's worth though. I don't get why this place only has three stars. Y'all know this place hits the g spot.,2

Sat at the sushi bar and was pleasantly greeted by the chefs. Had a couple of their famous rolls and some yellow tail sashimi. Quality was great and service was super fast even for lunch time. They were fairly busy and yet still took great care of me. The chefs made small talk while they made my rolls so time went by quickly. Definitely my new lunch time sushi place!,2
"Most Starbucks have improved greatly where you can get quick and correct orders. n nThis airport location is right off the Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle 'gates'. So most folks hit it on the landing or exit to get their caffeine fix. n nIt is run by only two employees in fairness, it is a small location so don't think more than 2 can fit without being on top of each other . n nThey do their best to move quickly but with just 1 person working while 1 takes orders it can have long lines depending on what time you land.",1
"On time, did a thorough a c checkup, made sure to remind me to change the filters regularly had not been doing so . Charged me a reasonable fee for service.",2
"We were in the area when our car broke down. Since we had our newborn baby with us, and it was 120 out, decided we should wait inside and that's how we ended up here. It was lunch time and I was shocked to see how much the lunch prices were! And on top of that, it didn't include a side salad, so had to pay extra to add one. Tortellini was OK, but not worth 13 for a small serving. n nThe staff is super friendly, and service was great, but I just can't get over the high prices for just OK food. I will say that the 7 canolli was very good. Still though, my boyfriend just ordered a side salad, while I stayed with the baby and ate the tortellini, and I ended up spending like, 45 on lunch after tip and felt way ripped off. n nIt's a shame their prices are so high when they don't even make their own pasta there which is easy to do and would probably save them money making them able to lower their prices to a reasonable, competitive price. I don't know how this place is still open. Way too expensive!",1
"Gabi's review got me jonesing for CJs so I headed back over for lunch. Maybe it's a middle age thing, but I always forgot how good they are in between visits. n nSince I live close by, this is pretty much how CJs and I roll 1 hit up website, 2 read entire menu 4 to 14 times, 3 pare down top 10 selections to 1 or 2 and call in order, 4 hop in car, and 5 return home 15 minutes later for a private pig out on the coffee table so I have room to spread out . They do offer delivery, but it takes longer to get my feast on and I don't always need want 15 of food. n nSince it's all pretty much been said, let me just tell you the few things that make CJs a stand out n I have never found one thing on their menu that I wouldn't order again. n There is nothing that CJs feta doesn't make better. bring it! n I could eat my weight in their pitas and never tire of them. n The creamy greek dressing is 'lick your plate clean' to die for. n You will not find a better deal on baklava anywhere in the city seriously it would be hard to get the ingredients for the price they charge . n nIf you are eating in, grab a cold beer or some wine to wash down your meal and they are working on upgrading their liquor license, so they will have mixed drinks soon . n nDon't let the location or the homey diner atmosphere fool you. This place serves up incredible food made from insanely fresh ingredients with flavors to match!",2
"I hate to pull the ""Noir Card "" card.but prepare yourself, because I'm about to. n nAs a Noir level MLife member, you come to expect good treatment from the hosts and staff at clubs in the MLife family. Now, I understand that Light Group manages and runs the clubs not the hotels themselves but it's still a courtesy to have a little grace with the people who've spent a ridiculous and I mean RIDICULOUS amount of money at the casino in which they're located. n nSome friends of mine were in Vegas and after getting a day bed at Daylight, we had a little disco nap, went to dinner, and headed over to Light. The group was small just 4 of us, even ratio and after dropping some serious cash at the pool, we figured that getting into the club wouldn't be too big an issue, considering the SAME ""manager "" was working the night club line. We. Were. Mistaken. n nEven though I'm local, and even though I'm a Noir member, and even though we'd spent a grip of cash that day at the pool.he said ""I'm sorry, but I'm still going to have to charge you a cover and have you wait in line.

"Great gaming! There was a live band, on a Sunday night, and they were really really loud. However, there were free shots, if you give a 2 tip, and the music was really good. But the gambling was great! 5 blackjack, which is something we looked for and were not able to find until we came to Carnaval Court. Definitely recommend it!",2
"This place does not deserve a single star. It was free with the room but the food was OLD, COLD, and TASTELESS! They don't even serve crab legs over the weekend! That is the whole reason for me visiting a buffet in the first place. Totally unhappy with the dinner here.",1
Cool place to see old photos and read brief history about Vegas. Not your typical pictures you see everywhere else. Looks like it will be continually growing and changing so will for sure check out again in the future. Oh and it's FREE donation box at door .,2
"It's alright.only ordered from here because my favorite Thai place is closed for repairs. To start with it's lacking in flavor, I hate when places just pour chili sauce on something, it's so one dimensional and not what I expect from Thai food at all. I ordered medium for 2 dishes and hot for my third. It was a big disappointment, all three were the same heat and it barely brushed mild on the heat scale. Delivery was quick, although if you order through eat24 expect to tip ahead or with cash I like to tip once I get the food based on service so I didn't like this . They have a large menu selection, but I do feel they have lost touch with traditional flavors, and I probably won't be ordering from them again.",1
"This place is tiny, dark, smells like an old gym, and they will nickel and dime you. If you need dog training, call superdog or one of the other dog training places that meet you at a park since it's basic clicker training. The training is standard but paying ot be outside will get you, well outside where it's nice, open, and not riddled with more smells than a petsmart and condo gym crammed into something the size of a subway. Plus you would be able to have more room to practice off leash techniques. n nIf you want the agility part and own a house just buy the stuff online and go in your back yard. n nDesk staff is too uptight and needs to relax so the experience is fun not create a tense environment for dogs that want to use it as a play session mixed with owner bonding. It just seemed they want to nickel and dime you for a lack luster facility.petsmart has a bigger private area then them, it was just very disappointing place.",1
"This spot at Town Square has been revamped a few times already but when I saw who was behind the Meatball Spot, I was very excited. I thought, ""This will definitely be the one to stay. "" I tried it last night and I was quite disappointed with the food. I do give credit to my server who spent a lot of time explaining their menu and the tastes of the different sauces, but other than her friendliness, the food fell very short of expectations. n nI ordered a side of spaghetti with pesto sauce 5.95 and a three meatball sandwich chose the Chicken meatballs with a jalapeno type spicy sauce . The side of spaghetti was extremely small and the pesto seemed very unbalanced with the amount of oil and herbs. I think it could have tasted a lot better, but what didn't help was that it came out barely lukewarm. The texture of the sauce was very thick and the olive oil was overpowering the ""pesto "" taste. n nThe meatball sandwich was also barely lukewarm. The bread wasn't toasted, it was served cold. I thought that it would have a nice crisp to it as a meatball sandwich sub hoagie whatever you want to call it but it was really tough and chewy. n nFor what it's worth, I thought the chicken meatball jalapeno taste was unique and alright, but the temperature of the food needs to be much hotter.",1
"Who is writing the reviews for this place? The owner's nieces and nephews? So, our first impression was very positive beautiful locale in the old part of Montreal. Thought had been given to making the restaurant a marriage between the old and the new. n nWe started by ordering a bottle of wine, but the waitress came back and said she wasn't sure we would enjoy it as it was ""natural. "" What in the world is a natural wine? Thinking there was something lost in translation even though I lived in Paris as a student and can speak some French , we ordered a different bottle of wine. This time, the sommelier came to our table to tell us if we sent back the first bottle, we would definitely not like this one. I politely reminded him that we did not send back the first unopened bottle, but that the waitress said we would not enjoy it and who would drink a wine after the waitress says it's not good? n nThe sommelier then said he would bring back a bottle we would enjoy. We thought we would get an amazing wine. My DH had indicated he liked full bodied Cabernets, etc. The sommelier comes to our table with an OPEN bottle of wine. That's right, it wasn't opened in front of us. Umm. Strange, maybe someone sent that one back. Anyway, he pours us a sip tasting and it is a good wine, but very light bodied. Something summery and drinkable, but not a fab wine. After all that, we really expected something great. Additionally, the sommelier never told us the price, nor showed it to us on the menu. In all of my previous experiences with sommeliers, they will point in the menu at least one option sometimes more than one option , and you order, knowing the price whether it's 40 or 400 . So, not only did the sommelier have in his list wines that a regular customer would not ""enjoy, "" but he brought us an opened bottle, suggested a wine that was not along the wine that we wanted that evening, didn't even ask us what we were eating, and didn't even show the price of the wine brought to the table. Very amateurish. n nFortunately, we just looked at each other, ordered mojitos, and the rest of the evening went off without a hitch. The food was solid and interesting. The main dishes were particularly good duck and fish . It was a little gimmicky the waiter pours the sauces at the table this could have easily been poured in the kitchen! . I couldn't help but feel they were trying oh so hard to make an impression of being so sophisticated. But, both the duck and the fish were well executed and the flavors were solid., so I know there is talent somewhere in that kitchen behind all that fanfare. I just wish they would have the confidence that the food is good enough. Because, right now the restaurant ""experience "" is an epic fail.",1

"This review is about 2 months late, but just knowing that I kept this place in mind means something. So, let me start by saying ""this place is horrible "". A group of friends and I went here before the Arizona ASU basketball game. Now, knowing that the 2 schools are rivals, you would think that it would be a big turn out. Well, it was. Apparently, The Tavern didn't bother staffing for it. The place was packed. There were only a handful of servers. Our server was in no hurry to help us. Our friend waited over an hour for his food and he only got his food after telling the bartender. Also, many drinks were dying while they sat at the bar, so we just walked up and grabbed ours. When we asked for the check, it took her at least 20 minutes to drop it off and it was all wrong. There was another tables food and drink on it. We told our server and she ""corrected it "". Except, she didn't. It was still wrong. So, we did it ourselves and left her the exact amount of what we owed. I'm a server myself, so I know how things go. Worst place ever.",1
"Mi Patio is our favorite restaurant. Not just our favorite Mexican restaurant.our favorite restaurant, period. I love the Greek influence since most ""traditional "" Mexican restaurants in phoenix look at me funny when I ask for vegetables. n nThe servers are always fast and friendly. the owner and managers talk with us like we've been friends our entire lives even though they may not even recognize that we are regulars. we eat at mi patio for dinner, lunch and get lunch takeout. it is always exactly what we were hoping for. n nif you enjoy hot sauce we've discovered that they make a spicy sauce using Frank's red hot but you have to ask for it. we ask for the diablo sauce since that is what they use for the diablo shrimp dish. n nmi patio is great for vegans too. they don't cook anything with lard and give you the opportunity to order anything without the cheese, without looking at you like your crazy. Ive enjoyed the vegetable enchiladas Mushroom, Zucchini, Egg Plant without cheese and didn't feel like i was missing out on flavor. n ntheir chips and salsa are my favorite in all of phoenix and they give you plenty with your food whether its to stay or to go. n nkids are always treated with respect and they have tons of tolerance for our occasionally screaming 1 year old. the kids meals have huge portions that make for great left overs and ice cream when theyre done! our 5 year old asks to eat at mi patio at least twice a week. n nwe LOVE the margaritas! there's nothing fancy about them but who needs fancy when you get to pay 2 or 3 bucks for a big ass margarita!? n ndon't let the outside of the building trick you into thinking its just a sleazy Mexican bar. the beer banners totally turned me off before my husband made me try it for the first time. just walk inside and enjoy the best of Phoenician Mexican food!",2

"DO NOT RENT HERE. Yes they have the biggest car selection at the airport, but it is not worth it. I rented through a third party and was treated like crap because of it. I was not allowed to speak to a person in the building, instead i was relegated to an intercom system with someone in Florida. The best part is she said ""Ok this is the car you are getting. and these are the colors it comes in. "" One week later I see my bill and they said I chose an upgrade at an extra FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. NEVER, NOT ONCE was the word UPGRADE ever used when this lady told me about my car.

This place is horrible and I will never rent here or go through the 3rd party again.",1
" 19 for an over cooked and virtually tasteless burger. The menu describes it as some type of exotic beef. I've had far better for 7.00 at Alphys in Arroyo Grande.

"" n nCan't remember the last time I left a ZERO tip. Poor food is not the fault of the server. In this case the food was only exceeded in its poor quality by the server's attitude. n nAnd to continue the rant it takes a ton of attitude for a restaurant to think its food is so tasty that they don't need to put salt pepper shakers on the table.

"By far the WORST service we ever received in any restaurant. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is that our food was good. We called ahead for a table for 8. I was told 45 min wait. Fine we show up and waited 15 minutes longer total 60 min We were seated next to a large group of kids and a wall. We ordered our drinks, It was so tight the wait staff couldn't even serve water to us. While we were waiting for our beer and appetizers, We never received the complimentary biscuits I asked the hostess if we could be moved to another larger table, they seemed very put out and they let me know that it was disruptive to the staff. They had to change servers since the new table was 6 ft away. After moving and waiting 15 yes fifteen I asked the server if we could please get our beer, and the lemon we had asked for our water. I also reminded her about the biscuits. I was told they were coming. Another server brought us our appetizer, sat it on the table and walked away. Were we supposed to eat off of the table? So we waited until someone came by, I asked for plates and again asked for our beer and lemon. We were brought out salads, that was messed up too. By that time, we gave up on the biscuits. I excused myself and asked to speak to the manager. I expressed my concerns, he apologized and said he would stop by the table. We finished our dinner, apologized to the server for being apparently so difficult. Before leaving I asked for the biscuits we should've received at the beginning of our meal to go. The manager NEVER came by to say anything to my family. There were so many other instances of poor service, from refills, to us not being offered additional plates for the kids, no warm towels offered at the end of our meal, on and on. Very disappointed in this particular restaurant, but I still reluctantly tipped the server a minimum 15 gratuity. I won't be back. Ever. I guess since it's LV, they assume we won't be regular guests, but to their dismay my sister lives here near Red Rock and strongly suggested she will never eat there again. Too bad, since we regularly try to support the business's in our neighborhoods.",1
"This place has an astounding collection of beer, about 30 on tap and what looked like hundreds in bottles! I had a Piraat to drink, artichoke dip appetizer, and a portabella wrap. The artichoke dip was the best I've had in a long time and the wrap was quite good, too. Everything tasted really fresh and delicious. It's nice to see a ""gastopub "" with several reasonably healthy choices, especially ones this good! n nThe service was friendly and the pub itself is really nice on the inside. I was there just before dinner time, so there weren't many other customers and it's hard to say how noisy it gets, but it seems like a great neighborhood pub to me. A real local business right next to the overwhelmingly chain oriented Waterfront. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would come here a lot.",2

Don't buy tickets without looking for a coupon first. Getting in for half price made it even better. You have to know what you are getting into and have the right attitude.

"Before going to Vegas, I checked out all the prices of the salons. I wanted to get my hair done for my anniversary. Luckily the Flamingos salon was almost the cheapest and the most convenient. Hair cuts were listed at 85 for women. I had just planned on a hair cut, but I got talked into highlights, low lights and a conditioning treatment. They do write up an estimate and have the patron sign it before doing the work. Imagine my shock when my 85 hair cut was listed as 125 I have ear length hair wtf , the highlights were 95, low lights were 65 and a conditioning treatment was 15. Yup, total rip off on advertising and real pricing. The stylist actually took the comb she was using on my hair and combed it through her hair several times to show me her hair. Then she proceeded to co ntinuemrunning the same comb through mynhair WTF?! The only positive was that my hair turned put spectacular. This is the only reason it gets two,stars. I certainly could have had all of these services performed at my local boutique salon for about 150, including tip. Buyer beware.",1

This is hands down the worst breakfast place ever. I used to live right next to it and gave it several chances. Every time I got an omelette the veggies would still be hard and raw. i got huevos rancheros which you could tell the sauce was canned and awful. maybe even old who knows. So far everything I have tasted is disgusting. This place is so gross. Avoid at all costs,1
"Food was good as well as drink when we finally got it. The service was horrible ! Considering they only had five tables . They claim to be fine dinning but they need to speed up the service and pay attention to what the customer needs. It took fifteen minutes for us to get a refill on our waters, that's after I asked for a refill. I have never had to ask for a refill. Zenshin at southpoint is 5 stars all day compare to this place.

"So like some of my fellow Yelper's I was walking the street of Liberty Ave on my lunch break with a coworker when we stumbled onto the Asian Fusion place. Intrigued with the lunch buffet we went in to give it a try. Um it was so odd. First I don't think there was another person in there besides the workers. So we ordered a drink and went to the buffet. I started at the cold one. Let's see there was some salad stuff but no dressing except what was either sour cream or yogurt. I dabbed my salad with that thinking well maybe this will be ok. NOPE it was gross, took one bite and put the plate to the side. The hot side was even worse! I couldn't not recognize a single thing I was eating and there were no signs explaining what the food was. to top it off almost everything was swimming in a brown or gray colored gravy. You would have thought me and my coworker were crazy as the plates of food piled up and up on our table as we adventurously kept trying stuff just to hate it and put the plate of food on the table to be collected. So up again and again to try something different but it was all awful. We left still hungry but out of time. My coworker apologized as it was more her idea than mine to go, but we collectively agreed we would never go back. Sad for the people there, they all seemed very nice.",1
"The reason I am giving 4 stars is not because this is the best sushi in the valley. This was my first conveyor belt sushi experience. I was happy to see that most of the rolls had a cover over them. This was a concern of mine SO.the Four stars there were several really great rolls and the fresh tuna was AWESOME. Some of the selections were just ok, but still worth eating. There were 3 of us that night and we all got stuffed to the MAX for 27 dollars TOTAL! The price is right, the food good and we all had a great time choosing the rolls and trying different selections. Definitely would visit again.",2
"I rented from this company to visit my family at Christmas. My flight was delayed by an hour, which put me arriving 15 minutes after the office closed, so I called the car rental place to let them know that I would be late. I spoke to the manager, who told me to call when I landed and we would try to work something out. When I landed at exactly 10 15 pm, I called him and he said they had already closed up and wouldn't be able to rent me the car I reserved. I completely understand that I was 15 minutes after their closing time, but they knew I would be late, and didn't wait for me. This company might be cheap, but the customer service you receive is commensurate with what you pay for. From now on, I'll pay the extra money just to rent from a company with good customer service. Rent at your own risk.",1
"Holy crap! This place is awesome! I was at work and decided to place an order for take out. Which is really convenient since it is about a 5 minute drive up the road. I am all about garlic chicken, and decided to order their lunch special. Only 5.75 for a whole lot of food! I went in to pick up my order and was greeted with a warm smile. It was as if they already knew who I was. My order was ready immediately. And it was delicious! This place gets 5 stars for their amazing service and for the food! I will be back soon ",2
"Be aware that when you buy shoes here, getting a refund is extraordinarily difficult. The receipt noted that ""Shoes may be returned for a full refund within 2 weeks of purchase if complete with box, inserts, and in new condition. "" n nI walked in a pair of 180 sneakers I bought for one or two miles and began getting heel pain. When I brought the sneakers back a week later, the store owner said they were not in new condition and could not be returned for a refund, only store credit. She also said that I should have just walked in them around the house so they wouldn't get dirty. About as effective as test driving a car, but only in your driveway. They looked ""in new condition "" to me. She said otherwise. n nNext time, I buy shoes on the Internet or at a store that has a rational, fair refund policy.",1
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! n nThis place may have the best tasting cupcakes in town, but their customer service left me very bitter! After reading reviews about the stellar quality of Vanilla Pastry Studio's product, I was really excited at the possibility of using them for our upcoming conference, even though they were more expensive than other local bakeries. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that the expense of their cupcakes wasn't limited to just dollars and cents. n nFor two weeks I went back and forth via email and phone with various members of the bakery staff trying to place an order for 12 dozen cupcakes the order would've been close to 500.00 . After several instances where my voice mail messages and emails went unanswered for 2 or 3 days, I finally made my concerns known to the owner, April Gruver. She assured me that they took all orders seriously and would be in touch with me the following day, but I never heard from her. In fact, five days went by before I ended up calling the bakery to follow up. An associate answered my call and I explained to him the situation, but no matter what I said or how many times he put me on hold, April would not come to the phone to speak with me first I was told she wasn't there, then I was told she was in the bathroom changing, then she ""had to run "" . Frustrated and appalled by the lack of professionalism and just downright rude behavior, I told her associate to let her know that we were taking our business elsewhere. Apparently she's not at all concerned with losing the opportunity to gain a large order and FREE publicity at a major event, because I haven't heard from her since. I don't care how good the cupcakes are. there's no excuse for this kind of disregard and rude behavior from a business owner.",1
12.00 to Valet? Yeah right. Best to treat locals better. DownTown Grand? You are 86'ed! Plenty of other places to go out and hang.,1
"Its a place my entire family LOVES! Everything on the menu is AMAZING! The chocolate pizza at the end is a must. The people there are fantastic, and accommodating. The Vibe is great! Clean environment, everyone working there looks happy to be there. I'm really excited for the park to open right by it. My kids can play, while we have a wonderful meal! We eat there at least once a week. At first, I thought it would be hard to get to, but not AT ALL! We just park right below and its right there!",2
"So, I like to think of myself as a purveyor of fine clubs. somewhat like a sommelier is to wine. My jaw literally dropped and the hairs on my neck started to stand as I entered XS. All you have to do is imagine yourself walking into a rap video set. One is immediately greeted with good music and upscale ambiance. Lighting was perfect. not too dark with just enough light so there are no super big surprises later on what I mean by that is . ""is that what she looks like in the light? n nWe had an outdoor table with bottle service so I'm not going to rate their bartenders. Our hostess was super friendly and kept checking in with us making sure everything was fine. Four bottles was the minimum for our outdoor cabana table. which was rather high, since there was only 5 of us. n nIt was Saturday night and the line to get in wrapped around the entire hotel corridor. Even the bottle service line was 100 people deep. Of course, we arrived fashionably late and approached the front. They shunned us away and told us to wait in the table service line! that's the reason for the 1 star We don't wait in lines! What the heck! The host quickly came and explained to us that there was no official VIP line and to wait in the regular table reservation line and we will be pulled out and let in. Surely enough. within 5 minutes we were pulled out of line. went between the velvet ropes and led to our awaiting table. n nImpressive establishment, great layout and good staff make this place a must visit spot if your in Vegas. Tip be prepared to drop some serious cash to have fun, because the only way to do it is table service. If your a girl, then be prepared not to drop a dime because people are popping bottles all night long! Also, the place is HUGE. your bound to lose some of your homies somewhere while roaming the club but hey, your not here to hang out with the homies are you? n nThey do have tables inside the club to gamble, so if you pick up on someone, you can show them what a baller you are and lose money on a dumb bet because you are too drunk to realize what your doing. n nMr Wynn, I have to admit, you've outdone yourself with XS. Just like the name implies, one is immediately overwhelmed by an excess of what makes Vegas. well. Vegas. n nViva Las Vegas. and remember what happens in Vegas. Stays in Vegas! n n my apologies as I do not have any pictures to post. The pics are either too incriminating or too graphic! ",2
A bundt cake was a previously unknown piece of food to me before this wonderful store too life over five years ago. Their chocolate cakes are amazing and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves sweets. n nService is fast and friendly nPlace is an established neighborhood staple nCakes taste amazing,2
"The serving of food is amazing and the customer devices is great, always a great place for lunch or dinner always leave with a doggie bag",2
I had a very bad experience trying to enjoy our food but cannot cuz their services suck . It's a very loud buffet and over price,1
"I had the Green Smoothie and it was so delicious! They allowed us to call ahead to place the order they take a long time to make your order normally . We arrived, paid and left with our drinks. Clean place, everyone is friendly and educated on what you order. I have also had the build your own meal and that is very good. I had Tuna steak with Quinoa and broccoli it came with a lemon sauce on the side there are more options . nI strongly recommend this place to my friends and family. They get so busy sometimes, so if you are in a hurry i advise to call ahead to place your order.",2
"We live very close to Yasu and been here for about 3 times. The first time was with my husband, it was decent. The second time was with my sister before her flight to NY, the service was slow food was decent, worst than the first time. We went there for the third time after my kids swimming lesson. Yes, we weren't dressed like we were a rich family after swimming practice! n nWe walked in at 11 45am and almost immediately we ordered right away. We also ordered 2 extra rolls 5 minutes later. The rainbow roll was HORRIBLE. Rice was hard and very cold, tasted it like overnight refrigerated rice. I made a complained to the waiter but he soon return telling me they don't know why it was hard and walked away. Okay, fine i will swallow the 13 roll that tasted worst than Frys' sushi. n nWe finished the food soon after and we were sitting there waiting for 2 more rolls to come. We waited. Waited and waited. No one came by to if we needed anything, no water refills, or take away our empty plates. It was like we were invisible. n nFinally I asked the waiter about my 2 rolls and told him I wanted to cancel. He then returned 5 7 minutes later with one of the sushi roll. We ate that and waited AGAIN. Waited and waited for my final roll to come. Finally I told the waiter I wanted the check. He came back 10 minutes later with my check and I was charged with 4 rolls. I told him I only got 3 rolls but he said no I got all of the rolls. He went to the sushi chiefs about it and they too said us had all the rolls. n nSERIOUSLY? Yasu? You think I'm gonna lie about eating those nasty rolls of yours? We did not leave until 1 30pm. I spent most of the time waiting for 4 rolls. 11 45 1 30pm is a longtime trying to have a quick lunch. The worst thing about this whole experience was that all of the staff made me feel like I ate the roll and don't want to pay for it. They were arguing behind the sushi bar about weather or not I ate the roll. n nIt's disgusting how you run your business! Shame on you Yasu. Worst service and sushi I ever had in my life. My husband and I love sushi and we spend a lot of money eating sushi monthly. And btw, we are not poor, my husband is an ER physician, we have money to pay for whatever we ordered. But I am not gonna pay for something we waited so furiously long for and still did not get to eat sushi. n nI am seriously disappointed at your extreme slow service, manners of your staff, and the not so fresh sushi. There are way too many options for sushi in Phoenix, and I will never waste a penny in this restaurant. Not this life time and the next! If I can give you a 10, 10 is what you should deserve in my rating!",1
"Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",1
"I am actually a Filiberto's fan, however this location just doesn't do it for me. Every time I have ordered from here. There food just doesn't have much flavor. I always drive by them on my way to work, like the idea that they are opened 24 hrs. But there are too many choices to choose from three by the time I hit the 101 fwy to settle on their food.",1
"amazing New York chicken friend steak and chicken fried chicken. Huge portions, if you're thinking to spend your money here or at a crappy buffet, this place is definitely going to be worth your money. I was staying at the Golden Gate the first time I ate there, the convenience of it only added to the wonderful experience. Salivating at the thought of going back! I had the same experience at their location in San Diego as well.",2
"The only reason Cherry gets four stars and not five is because of its location. It's not anywhere close to the strip, but for us Las Vegas locals, it's a big winner. n nGood music, great dance floor. A really fun atmosphere due to the large amount of locals. The BEST part is that it spills out into an extremely sexy private pool and cabbana area this is THE place to be during the hot summers. I hear they also have special topless pool parties every Sunday afternoon. n nI highly recommend the Red Rock Hotel in general.",2
"Bought a Groupon to try out a new salon that was closer to where I live. Made an appointment for a Saturday at 4 30pm. I had called to see if they can take me earlier because I was in the neighborhood, and they said no so I said ok 4 30. Get there and I sat for 35 minutes. No one said hello and no one came over to say that my stylist was running late. I had an appointment at 6 15pm over on the Westside. At about 5 05 or so the stylist finally came and got me. We talked about my hair and kinda what I was wanted.the process proceeded. Her chair is in the corner so when it got dark outside, which it was a cloudy rainy day to begin, she had a hard time cutting so I had to move to a different chair. She cut my hair in less than 20 minutes and styled it. They style was not something I weat but that was ok. When I got home after my appointment I olayed with my hair and realized that it was totally uneven and was not laying right. I tried to work with it but couldn't. I called and made another appointment to get it fix and she said, ""oh I kinda thought that was going to happen, it was a little dark. "" She cut and cut and cut way to short and way to many layers. I HATE my hair still. I called back and NO ONE returned my call. It was important to have a great hair cut and a hair style that one loves and or likes. So now I have a haircut that does not work for me at all. I DO NOT recommend this salon at all. I will travel all the way to Tempe to see the lady that cuts my hair from now on.",1
"The counter staff is phenomenal. There is always a line and he is very cool headed and takes everyone's order concisely. The problem that I have had here is that the two times I have visited, they have messed up my order 3 times. Yes, you read that correct THREE TIMES. One time it was fixed quickly and today it was messed up twice. I am not sure what the kitchen staff is doing back there, however, the wait time and accuracy is ridiculous. I won't go back due to the fact that they have goofed 3 times out of 2 visits. Food is very good, when made to order.",1
"My boyfriend and I stopped here last night the first time after venturing Oakland. We loved the smell of the freshly made waffle cones that hit us once we walked in!

Everything looked delicious even the vanilla I'm no fan of that flavor.",2
I love this place! The white coffee with soy milk is awesome. In addition the workers there are super nice and easy to talk to.,2
Not coming back. Got a haircut I didn't want. He even lined my front edge. I NEVER GET MY FRONT EDGED! n nHe didn't even ask. Said I should have told him. It was NOT what I wanted.

"Stayed at the Nugget since I got a pretty good internet deal. 3rd time to Vegas and after suggestion after suggestion on where to stay I figured what the heck and stay close to Fremont st. The Nugget is on top of Fremont. Checked in on the Rush tower side stay there if you can much less crowded since everyone checks in on the lower priced side and can check in to what ever room your in much quicker! Plus looking at the giant aquarium gives the rest of your party something to look at while your filling out your info. The room we upgraded to the Gold Tower was a nice size, attractive color scheme, average appointment's. Flat screen, but cable and wi fi are xtra. Bed was super comfortable, stayed at Sheraton a week before and there was a suprising no comparison to the bed's and Sheraton was more expensive! The pool was fine, sure you may have to get there early, but that goes with just about every hotel in Vegas right? The water slide was super fun, had to wait a bit but again summer in Vegas all you do is wait for just about everything. I suggest you rent a daybed or Cabana upstairs in the H2O adult's area only if sittin by the pool is your Vegas style vaca. Lot's of families so it's well worth the and effort to stay in the H20 area. We hit the pool only once and got lucky, I found a chair right away while the BF played crap's. After we swam, we sat at the poolside Blackjack table. I'm not a gambler and the empty 3 table was inviting. Won 100.00 and the dealer was super cool about my amature status! Didn't eat at the restaurant's so can't rate them. The hotel over all is quite attractive and the staff was mostly super friendly. I have to give major prop's to the valet guy's! They took care of us! If you call ahead for your car by a 1 2 hour, they will have it ready to go for you when you come down. Otherwise if you have them get it while you wait, be prepared. They are very busy and it seemed only 2 or 3 valet's were there at any give time. They were cool about the call ahead and it was nice just going from air con hotel to air con car, Vegas in July ya feel me! The only down fall to this whole experience was the house keeping or lack thereof. First full day room was not made up at all. The hotels policy is to change the sheet's every other day which is fine. But we came back the first full day at 01 00 and the room was not made up i.e. bed not made,crap on the floor and no clean towels. Called housekeeping, they were willing to come and fix room but at the early morning hour I just wanted to drop into my unmade bed. Next day and rest of stay 5 day's used water glasses not replaced, cocktail glasses not removed and garbage that missed the can still on floor hotel robes not hung up I picked up after us . Toilitries replaced once. So basically housekeeping consisted of making the bed and replacing towel's. Maybe I was expecting too much of the housekeeping dept? All in all it was fine, yes the bathroom is small but how much of your vaca do you really spend in there? And yes the pool was crowded, but your not the only person that know's of this hotel. It's super popular with families. And one last thing, this location is best if you have a car. It's pretty far from the strip and the Sahara is the closest hotel with the monorail access and it's quite a distance if you walk. The area around the Nuggetl is sketch but after driving around the area's of Las Vegas near the bigger hotels their sketch too! Just don't go looking for trouble.",2
"Their food is ok. I would not call it special or extraordinary, but it is not bad. The service is less than desirable.",1
"I wasn't too impressed with the chocolate festival. Although the location itself was very picturesque with the tree lights and nice walkways, it was so crowded on Saturday that when you walked around, it seemed like you could only inch your way from booth to booth. When we actually got to the booths, we were disappointed to find that most of the chocolate goods for sale used chocolate as an ""accessory "" to the dessert rather than the main focus. For instance, while there were some booths that sold fudge, most of the booths were mainly selling some sort of fruit or main dessert dipped in chocolate. We came here in anticipation of trying out some chocolate dipped key lime pie, only to discover that the one booth that sold it, had sold out for the night. n nIn addition, when we were here it seemed like just a big conglomeration of booths, with only some of them selling chocolate. It seemed like most of the booths were either some sort of non food good like jewelry, hair pins, etc or fair type food such as lemonade and funnel cake. n nI would have liked to see a chocolate contest, where the different booths have a different chocolate item for people to buy, with the winner announced at the end. I think this would have attracted more booths to offer more chocolate options.",1

"The phrase, ""Let's not and say we didn't "" comes to mind after staying here. We had booked for two nights and only stayed for one. We asked for two beds and when we arrived there was a single king. They said it was never a guarantee and only a request, and said they could give us a roll away bed. They said it would arrive in 15 minutes. well, an hour later and it still hadn't arrived. We went to dinner, gambled a bit, came back, and it still wasn't there. When we called the front desk they said that the person that handles roll away went to lunch, and wouldn't be back for an hour. So let's do the math. we arrived at 5pm, went to dinner, came back to our room at 10pm, and at 11pm our roll away finally arrived. Only took SIX hours, I call that SERVICE bad service . Not to mention the roll away bed sucked no surprise there . n nWas there anything good? Well. n You have to pay when you enter the parking structure 5 , and if you are a hotel guest you have to get reimbursed from the front desk later. there was a very long front desk line. by long, I mean. is it worth the 5? Big pain in the butt. n There was hardly any parking in the parking structure, we ended up going to the 4th floor just to find a parking spot, which wouldn't be so bad if the elevator didn't suck see next bullet point . n The elevator in the parking structure is horrible. It takes FOREVER. After waiting FOREVER for the elevator to finally reach the 4th floor so we could take our luggage downstairs, it was FULL probably with all the other people that waited FOREVER for the elevator. We ended up hauling our luggage down the 4 flights, and lugging them back up the same flights because the elevators take. FOREVER you got it! n Toilet paper. So, usually, there's extra TP in a bathroom. Nope. We had half a roll to start with, and that was it really? . We used it sparingly, since after the scenario with the roll away. n The regular king size bed was awful. I couldn't sleep well, tossed and turned, and woke up with back soreness. n The noise from across the street is so loud that it actually permeates the room. I was on the bed across from the window and it just boomed all night. I'm not complaining that the music was thumping all night, I'm complaining that the stupid room isn't soundproofed enough so that I DON'T hear it. n nNeedless to say, we only stayed one night at the Plaza. You are cheap, not very easy, and not worth it. Pay the extra money and go to the strip. The Monte Carlo was a dream compared to this place.",1
"These two amazing women serve up the best soup I've ever had at the recently relocated Pittsburgh Public Market. They usually offer three soups meaty veggie vegan so there is something for everyone.

"This store is on a short list of places my fiance refuses to go into. The list consists of Guitar Center and Ikea. While I am a fan of the latter I have to agree that going into Guitar Center has become like nails on a chalkboard to me. n nFirst of all, it is loud as to be expected with a store that sells musical instruments. But this store is loud in a chaotic, disarming, and jarring way. As Jake C. pointed out there will always be someone shredding on a guitar with the volume on 11. There will always be some guy in the drum room showing off his double bass skills. In addition to the folks that use this store as their own musician's showcase you have the staff who really ruin any chance this store has of keeping me as a customer. It is inevitable that when I go in here the employee behind the counter is going to be so caught up in some conversation with Pimply Tommy about his punk band he is starting that I wait for at least 15 minutes to be helped. OR I am immediately approached and the employee tries to talk to me using all kinds of lingo to see just how much I know about drums. Look 'Sticks' or whatever fun nickname you have put on your name tag, I don't play drums, I am just trying to save you from having my fiance come in here and start a riot because it takes 20 minutes to get some drum sticks! My fiance ordered stand parts from here once and I had to wait for 10 minutes before someone helped me and then another 20 minutes while they searched for the parts that they had just called and told us arrived an hour before. n nI have to give them 2 stars just because they do stock a huge variety of musical instruments and accessories. But this store is one of the main reasons I am so glad we can shop on the internet.",1
"Rawhide used to be a great place and tradition to visit in October to celebrate all the October birthdays in our family. The food and music was good and a walk in the town was fun, especially this time of year. nThe menu has changed and my favorite flat iron steak is no longer available. They give boring dinner rolls with dinner now instead of the yummy corn bread. My husband thinks the new menu is better. I disagree. nDuring this visit we hadn't even had a chance to order our drinks before the pedaling magician was at our table doing tricks for tips. The kids enjoyed the tricks, but we would have appreciated if he let us get settled in first. nNow they charge 5 to park in their empty lot and the town is no longer decorated for Halloween, no more headless horseman or coffins. They don't even do the haunted train ride anymore. It is easy to see why Rawhide is now a ghost town.",1

"The Palazzo Venetian is supposed to be almost on par with the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas. However, if you think they are even in the same category, you are sorely mistaken, my friend. It's ok, I made this mistake as well. I was tasked with planning a vacation for a group of friends, and we had a few poor people in the group, so I picked the Palazzo over the Encore because it was about 130 cheaper a night. When I opened the door to my room, there were stains on the headboard area of the bed. The marble separator between the bedroom and living area had stains that could not be washed out as well. The walls were scuffed somewhat badly. nWhen we arrived, we did not receive our baggage for almost an hour. We realized that this was because they gave us a ticket and did not tell us that we had to call the front desk and tell them the number on the ticket before they'd bring it to our room. nWhen we asked for a humidifier, they gave us a broken one. When we asked to get it fixed, the service man told us that they all were like that implying that we didn't know how to use it . We left it on overnight, and the water level did not go down at all. The next day, they admitted it was broken and we got another one that worked. nWhen we asked for champagne flutes, they did not have any. Only wine glasses and again, it took almost an hour to get them. We had to call twice to get them because we asked for 8 and they said we could only order 4 per room. We had to call them the second time to tell them that we had 2 rooms which should have been obvious since they were both under the same name . nWorst of all, the showers did not always have hot water. After a long and dirty night of nightclubbing, we came back to take cold or barely lukewarm showers. I imagine this is what Sheldon Adelson enjoys doing. I did this for 3 nights in a row. nOne of my friends enjoyed a rib eye at the Grand Lux in the Venetian. He had diarrhea attacks all day the next day and had chills as he was shivering on the toilet. I was deterred from using the toilet the next day, as he had laid uneven splatters of excrement on the back of the seat. I had to use the toilet in our other adjacent room. nLastly, the beds were beds for short people. If you are anywhere near 6ft tall, your feet will hang over the edges uncomfortably. I would recommend this hotel if you are a poor midget. Overall, I got the impression that Mr. Adelson had let his American properties wane in order to focus on the real moneymaking Asian properties something that I would believe Steve Wynn Weinberg would never do.",1
"So I enjoy my Second Amendment tremendously. The facility is pretty amazing here. I am floored at how well developed the shooting areas are, the different areas for different size weapons, and the awesome set up of everything. It is a private club but the price for membership is exceptional. Yes it is outside but we all need to get a little more Vitamin D in us.",2
"I drove 45 minutes to get here. The place was chinatown cute and the menu looked bomb but the service was SKIMPY. They were nice enough but they seat you, get your drinks food to you and that's IT. We aren't high maintenance so it wasn't a big deal for us but I can see this being an issue for others. n n3 of us got soups with different width noodles. I ordered the same type of noodles as my husband but when received, my noodles looked at least twice the width as his. The broth was ho hum just not enough of a savory type flavor and the noodles bland and tasted doughy. There were a couple things that were good like the potstickers YUM, teriyaki chicken, fried tofu but the general feeling at the table was an ehhhhhhhh n nMy family politely chatted about maybe trying other items next time but I felt like there was alot of disappointment around the table not to mention leftovers that no one wanted to take home . n nYelp You totally let me down on this one ",1
"This place is horrible, went with a group of friends and as soon as we got there it was a crappy place. Being that the hotel is on the strip you would think there be an excellent upkeep but NOPE! That's not the case at all! n nAs soon as we parked we noticed that the hotel elevator smelled kind of funny, and didn't sound like the most secure elevator at all. We go and check in and the front desk person tells us that they'll being holding my security deposit AND the charge again but they were specific as to why I called my bank upset and they told me that it's the hotels issue, the bank didn't have a problem releasing it . n nWe FINALLY get our room and we head up the elevator and notice how run down the hallways look. It looks like a hotel you'd see in a shady part of town and want to run in the other direction. Not cool. n nWalked into the room and OMG! The looks on our face were probably priceless. We turn the light on to see the bathroom it looks like it wasn't cleaned properly, it honestly looks like they wiped it down really quick and moved on. We go and see the bed and we see there's a HUGE crack on the wall! I'm not even sure how it got there! n nThe entire experience was crappy for what I paid for and especially being that it's on the strip you would think it'd be better. n nMy advice, pay the extra 20 30 to stay in a nicer place, your in vegas you deserve it!",1
"I had my dog spayed here. While I agree that they are not smiley or talkative, I didn't go there to chat. They did the operation well and for cheap. n nI'm taking my dogs for vaccination there now since the other vets charge 45 for inspection besides the vaccination fee. My dogs are fine and they only need vaccination so why should I end up paying 100 for 2 dogs to some vet. So, I love this clinic for being systematic and cost effective solution.",2
Went here bc we were looking for ice cream. How does a creamery not serve ice cream? Somehow I feel that my one star rating is overrated,1
"After our show, the missus and I decided to check out Tao. n nWe went off recommendations of other Yelpers for our dining choices. I tried the Chilean sea bass, while the missus had the Wasabi encrusted steak. The fish was very sweet, but pleasant and flavorful. The meat was smoky and rich. n nThe preparation was excellent, but for the prices, I would have preferred larger portions. It's very much a ""presentation "" meal, meaning that it's very pretty to look at, but that factor is likely factored in the overall meal cost. The veggies were good as well, however. n nThe other factor of the restaurant is the restrooms. ""What "", you say? Hear me out. They are not listed ""Men "" and ""Women "". They are listed ""Yin "" and ""Yang "". I stood there, having no idea what the Hell to do, until deductive logic forced me to go in the door next to the statue without breasts on it. Considering the lack of women inside and resulting screams, I chose wisely. The correct door for us is ""Yang "", gentlemen. And you're welcome. Seriously, I'm all for going against convention, but practical applications for practical purposes. n nThe inside is very nice, and gives a great ambiance. The servers were always ready to to proved respectable service, and the food was tasty, if a little smaller than my likings. But not a bad experience overall.",2
"I stopped in Urban Wax for an eye brow wax and met with quite possibly the most rude and confrontational person I've ever experienced in a professional setting named Sara. I sat down and tried to explian to Sara the brow shape I wanted. She kept drawing outlines on my brows that were completely opposite of what I described. When i tried to explain again, she became ANGRY and said she knew what she was doing, that she was the ""expert "". When I told her that she was making me uncomfortable she quickly raised my chair for me to get up! I told her she was being very inappropriate and she began to RAISE HER VOICE with me to the point that one of the girls from a back room came out to see what was going on. The recpetionist at the front desk, Jessica, was very quiet though she heard everything that transpired , but polite and said she would have the owner call me. Mean while, Sara sat in a chair trying to ARGUE that she didn't do anything wrong and that I was ""the inappropriate one "". I told her she was out of line speaking to a customer like this she bobbed her head back and forth and just kept trying to engage me in a confrontation. It was a surreal experience. Would hate to have her come near me with hot wax. I've read the reviews for Urban Wax and it looks like a nice salon, but they should seriously consider getting rid of people like this girl before more bad reviews start pouring in.",1
"I had my perceived expectations of the festival. At first, it was all that I expected. On opening day, people here there were dressed in medieval costumes and of course stage actors roaming around the crowd. I can't say I was too impressed by the opening act. However, the fun started as the gates opened! n nIt seems the parade of jesters and shops go beyond what I had in mind. The place was huge! Our first stop was to watch the Bagpipes and drums definitely worth the suntan! I loved it! Jousting was cool, but it was nothing like Knights of Mayhem on the History channel. I guess it was the PG version. n nFood and drinks were pricey but that was a given. I didn't get to eat the super sized Turkey Leg, but I ate and drank enough it didn't really entice me. n nOverall, it was good fun and entertaining. I really appreciate cultural outings. Enjoy!",2
"They treats locals like kings and queens. Great local quality djs and celeb djs. Organized staffing inside and outside. Quality filtered crowd. Clean restrooms and club. No bad odors in or out. Smells fresh, new and clean and worth bottle service. Girls are taken care of with drinks and entrance into the club. A great place for a B day. The outdoor views are amazing. Bigger mass produced commercial clubs may open but there's only one XS. I like Surrender and Tryst too. Marquee and Act are cool.",2
"I have no idea what the 3 star reviews are for, this place is great especially for 20",2
"Probably my favorite spot in Las Vegas to pick up comics, new and old. The place has been around a while and the experience shows. Large and constantly update inventory of more then just comics they also have an excellent selection of toys . Also, important to me is a helpful, but not pushy staff. The owners employees have all the right answers at the right time but don't stalk you around the store, which is nice. Definitely worth a trip in, the only downside is it shares a parking lot with the exceptionally busy gym and grocery store which makes for a frustrating experience, but hardly a deterrent.",2
"I feel sad for this particular Benihana. It is located inside The Las Vegas Hotel ick! so one would assume this place would be equally as gross. n nFortunately this Benihana is quite pleasant. The waitstaff and chefs are all eager to please. Food is very good. n nThis is a fun place, but note that it isn't cheap. Go knowing food will be at least 35 per person, without drinks. Food is good and worth the prices.",2
"Horrible, Horrible experience. I was called just days before my big birthday cut and color to learn Johnny was not longer with the establishment. I was reassured Ali was a whiz with color and short hair. I should have cancelled. I was a rolling disaster from there. We discussed what I wanted, it sounded like she understood and long story shorts, 4 hours later my hair is not the right color or anywhere near the cut I asked . Trying to be professional myself I let them kniw I was extremely dissatisfied. 24 hours later I was more pissed. I was offered to see Matt their lead stylist to evaluate abd correct. I should have declined. The day of my apt. I was advised he was too busy so they would put ne with Georgette. Miss talks too much and does not listen to what you say. I called her out in it several times. I asked the highlights to be blended, natural looking. I got chunks. I will NEVER go back.",1
"Usually enjoyable, but valentines day menu sucked, so i ordered off the taste menu and the portion sizes were appropriate for a 3 year old. Went there expecting duck and gnoche, left with empty wallet and empty stomach.",1
"My wife and I have been coming to Gelato 64 for years. We have always been blown away with the stellar selection of favors and we love the modern look to the place. If you are a fan of unique fruit flavors like I am you will love it. I always get flavors like Pear, Kiwi, Apple, Guava or Passion Fruit. My wife likes more traditional flavors like chocolate and strawberry. There is a flavor for everyone! n nThe service is always outstanding and they never seem to get annoyed by customers asking to sample lots of flavors. The prices are a little high in my opinion, but it's a small price to pay for our favorite dessert destination. We tried Frost and hated it. It didn't have any of the unique fruit flavors that this place has. Don't believe all the hype about Frost, it sucks. n nGelato 64 has amazing flavors and great service! We can't say enough great things about this place!",2
"NO MORE GATOR TAIL?!?!?!?! I used to love this place, their drinks were awesome, food is great, and the price isn't bad. Now I have been informed they no longer will get gator tail. No gator tail means i will not go back bummer",1
"I had high hopes for this place. I'd heard that Barrio had won awards and was a must go place. My lady and I live close by so we decided to try it out. The wait was 45 minutes which was fine. We walked around and saw the artwork and the murals along 16th street and had a nice wait. When we were seated, we ordered drinks, the waiter mumbled a bit, and got them. This is the highlight of the meal. The beer was cold. After that, the waiter would meander by and mumble things like ""Yokay? "" and ""Howboutmore? "" before walking away, not waiting for a response. The food came, I had the Pollo Poblano, and I have never had a drier piece of chicken nor as flavorless a sauce. We get the check and.well, save yourself the money and buy a tank of gas to drive somewhere else to eat.",1
"I can't stand Walmart. Unfortunately, I don't always have the luxury of paying more for something somewhere else. I can't stand their long lines, the difficulty in finding someone to help, the sloppy displays, etc. You can blame customers for making messes and I do blame them but I swear Walmart schedules as few staff as possible, so it takes longer to get shelves organized. And don't let them forget to put a price on something! n nI used to have a pre paid debit card through them. They have so few staff regardless of which Walmart I went to that to put money on the card took waaaay too long. They lost me as a customer I terminated the account.",1
"It's a quick meal for lunch, but fairly unappetizing. I am quite unsure why there was such a long line leading to the entrance. It's place I am definitely not look forward to visiting again.",1
"After the hotel side messed up my reservation without 2 beds in the room and 2 hours later, they decided to move us to the timeshare side Towers which is still pretty new. We were placed on the 58th floor and all I have to say is that it's NICE. Relaxing and very ""airy "" feel even for a ""studio "" sized unit. The bathroom was clean and of higher end quality materials which could be seen throughout . n nI won't ever stay on the hotel side again after all the hassle that I had but the Towers.that's a different story! Who knows after a few years what it will look like when it gets a bit run down. So stay there now if you can. n nThe big plus is that the rooms and floors do NOT smell like smoke, which is nice.",2
"So much fun with friends. We came on a saturday night around 1am and sang our hearts out. I will say that drinking soju and eating some rice cake. SEOUL TRAIN is definitely something i haven't seen in person, but did this time around. n nThe songs are really good popular music totally available! LOVED IT!",2

"This establishment apparently made an agreement with the city of Glendale to force their customers to pay a 20 fee on ""game day "". This is completely insulting and they really should have thought this arrangement through before building here. I refuse to pay some random city an extortionist 20 just to patronize their businesses! There isn't even a validation option. Don't waste your money, give it to another city.",1
Friendly service well priced menu open 24 hours!,2
"Overall it was ok. What they are charging for the food you get is not worth it. I have had much better for the same or even cheaper. Flavor was good but nothing better then I could do in my home kitchen. The menu, wait I mean menuS, I remember 5 of them but might have missed 3 or 4, are over complicated and not well put together. Presentation was really lacking in all of the plates we had. If you are a craft beer drinker STAY AWAY, selection is about as good as Circle K. The only good part of our dinner was the service. We were greeted upon arrival and taken to our table. Our server Jeff was very attentive and had a smile all of the time. He was able to explain all of the food to perfection. Another great part of the service was the busser. I usually do not even notice this but even he was happy and was there to clear your table at the perfect time every time and was very polite. Overall I would not go back.",1
"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30 80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with ""it's just how we do things "" and ""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little "". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner ""really doesn't care "". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere.",1
"What a cute place! We came in here for dinner and were pleasantly surprised! This is a definite family feeling environment, the service was really friendly and welcoming. We had told the hostess who I think is part owner that it was our first time and she came over a few times throughout our dinner to ask how everything was and offer suggestions. She also provided us with free drinks on the house to end our superb meal. n nThe Balsamic Chicken is AMAZING and the Pear Salad was a little piece of fresh heaven. Great combination of flavors and dressing. n nYou will definitely enjoy a visit here.slightly overpriced, but the service and environment make up for all of that!",2
I have always had good service at Olson's for the last 20 years.,2
"There is nothing more frustrating than taking your pet to the vet because you think something is wrong with him, and having the vet completely ignore everything you tell her. This is why I do not take my dogs to Alta Vista anymore. n nI took my older dog to Alta Vista after we adopted him because it was close, and I had a free exam certificate from the shelter. The vet seemed nice enough, and I'll give her a pass on the fact that she clearly had no idea what breeds he might be she told us he'd get 50 pounds, max, when full grown today, he's 70 . n nSo, figuring that they were ok from the first visit, I took him in when he started having issues. Vet 1 ""thought "" he might have bladder crystals, and sent him home with expensive prescription food and an order to come back in 4 weeks. n nVet 2, on the return visit, completely disregarded everything that had been written in my dog's chart as well as everything I told her, and wanted to run a bunch of expensive tests. Vet 1 had told me he'd just need a retest for the crystals, Vet 2 wanted to send him through the ringer. No thanks. n nWe got the hell out of there as fast as we could manage. I don't do doctors who don't listen. She may have the degree, but I live with the dog and know what he is and isn't doing. n nNeedless to say, we haven't been back. And my dog? He's perfectly fine.",1
"Love zia records. They always have great deals on cds, blu rays and whatnot. The staff is always very helpful and kind. I highly recommend for about anything you are looking for.",2
I would give this one star except it's one of the few Philly Cheesesteak places in town. Meat was dry and underseasoned. Bread was decent. Just no reason to ever go back. n nDon't know why you'd serve a sandwich with meat as dry as this.,1
"We are planning to move to Madison from Virginia, and I needed a place to stay. Also, I wanted to bring my dog along for some company my husband and daughter stayed home for work school . I'm so glad I found this place! n nAs other reviews have noted, you get an actual suite with a door and everything! There is a kitchen with a full sized refrigerator, microwave, stove and sink. It also comes stocked with silverware, plates, and pots and pans. n nThe hotel has a small convenience area in case you don't want to go out for food. There are a few frozen meals, etc. Free wi fi as well. n nThe full breakfast was pretty good, too. Waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy on most mornings , pastries, coffee, etc. n nMy only complaints and these are pretty minor was that the TVs weren't very new. And the shower curtain was so thick and heavy that it kept touching me. A curved shower curtain would do wonders. n nThe front desk staff was so nice! There was an issue with my check in they didn't have me on record , but they were accommodating. And one of the desk guys said that if someone had to leave their dog all day, he'd walk the dog for the guest! Cool! n nAll this for under 100 a night. Can't beat it! I'll stay here again.",2
"Wonderful company, receptionist nichole is very pleasant, helpful and professional. Within minutes I called, she scheduled my appointment, called my tenant, emailed me coupons. She's great!",2
"For value for flavour and this is a winning choice for sandwichy fare. I must admit that I have only had the warm Spicy capicoli sandwich with cheese and cucumber slathered in their hot sauce, but it is so frickin delicious. I'm serious. It's so good and cheap , I have found it difficult to stray and try something different which really isn't my typical MO . My friends loved their Grilled Chicken Sandwiches with avocado, and the Vege Pate sandwich, so solid reviews all around. The resto also makes delicious smoothies which are great support characters to the main dishes. There is always a case full of danishes and desserts, but I haven't had a chance to indulge in these yet. n nThe ambiance is sort of hipster hippie a la Santropol , but friendly and welcoming . oh and the prices include taxes. I like it when restos do that, just my thing I guess. n nThis place is totally worth a visit or a few .",2
"We decided today when were eating this phenomenal middle eastern food that we are so sad for people who are unadventurous eaters. In general Middle Eastern food is flavorful and healthy and delicious. Zaytoon was all of that and more. We ate dinner there, where there is only about 7 tables. The waiter and waitress were extremely friendly and sweet. We started with their baba ghanoush that was so good I got an extra order to go home. It came with a great fresh baked flatbread. For entrees we got their ""bone in chicken kabob "" which was actually a whole cornish game hen cut into pieces, marinated and grill. Super moist and flavorful. It came with rice, an onion salad and a blistered tomato. We also got their special which was a lamb shank and might have been one of the best lamb shanks we have ever had. Delicious. We walked out very happy. n nAlso they have fresh juices that they juice to order. I got the watermelon and the boy got carrot and beet together. Both were delicious and refreshing. I will definitely go back, but just something to keep in mind, this isn't a huge restaurant, it is a very intimate setting. But I love it and will be back for some juice soon!",2
Waited 1.5 hours to pay and another hour to be seated. The buffet ran out of food no prime rib or meats! Great desserts.,1
"Ugh, it's always so crowded and unless you show up an hour early be prepared to sit in the front row. The concession stands are over priced and not that good. I much prefer Ultra Star Cinemas on Indian Bend and the 101. So much better and more relaxing. Coming to this theater is always such a chore. I have to park out by the US Bank and hike in and it's a zoo. I'll gladly drive 15 minutes out of my way for a better more relaxing experience.",1
"Right next door to downtown Urbana is Bunny's the most unrated bar in Urbana. They've got the cheap drinks and food, the outdoor patio and lack of scenesters. Thank God! n nWith the smoking ban in place, this small time bar is probably struggling for business. Stop in and have a few drinks. drop a few quarters in the jukebox and tip your bartenders.",2

"I'm not a vegetarian nor a raw food person, but my love for beautifully fresh or beautifully cooked veggies rivals, and on certain days surpasses, my love for meat. On one such day I decided to try out Luna's for lunch with a work friend. n nI was not disappointed in the least. The staff was polite but distant however, the quality of the meal overshadowed their. translucency. I ordered the raw veggie lasagna ""Lunasagna "" and it was delicious. The tomato sauce was especially tasty. The lemonade I had with it was refreshing as well made with real lemons and not cloyingly sweet. n nLuna's is a little on the expensive side, and from my experience at least, it's not the place to go if you want to make small talk with the staff. But the food is delicious and healthy, and if that's what you want, you should check it out. I know I'll be back every once in a while.",2
"If you are looking for a barber, then Brandon is your man. I have been going to him for the last 6 years and it feels good knowing that I don't have to worry about the outcome of my next haircut. Brandon is a master barber and knows. how. to. cut. hair. He is good with the clippers and the scissors too. It's rare to find barbers these days that know how to use scissors correctly.",2
"If you're going here I would suggest going for the bagels or takeout items only. We were seated for 4, it was very busy but our waitress was not as attentive as she should've been. n nOne person ordered a Reuben and it was super lopsided, one half had all the fixings and the other had none making it difficult to eat. n nThe salmon Benedict came with poached eggs which were over done and the middle underneath was torn open with salmon which was super salty and the English muffin was barely toasted and overall the dish was lukewarm. n nAnother person in our party asked the waitress if there was an option to get just a plain bagel with cream cheese and lox sliced salmon no capers or tomatoes or anything else needed. She gave a complicated answer and ended up charging him for a platter includes cucumber, apr u00e8s, tomato, onion, olives, salmon, bagel and cream cheese 12 and brought it with only salmon bagel and cream cheese. You can't tell me there wasn't a cheaper and simpler option? n nThe bagel, cream cheese and lox were great. The service was rushed, in attentive and not personable. So I would only go back for take out bagels or bakery items and wouldn't sit down to eat.",1
"It pains me to give the services department a poor review. n nWhen I realized that this was the bike shop that Francisco had gone to after having worked on my bike at Bike Source back when the service was actually good at Bike Source I was hopeful that I had found a place to get my bike serviced. n nThis store is obviously focused on road not mountain biking. Being primarily a mountain biker, I was hesitant to use this store for my repair work. I specifically asked if they serviced mountain bikes and was told that this a ""Full Service Bike Shop "". Great. I dropped off my bike and promptly got a call from Francisco. He was extremely detailed and listed every little bit of wear and tear on my bike. He told me what needed to be replaced and what I could keep using for the time being but would have to replace down the road. He didn't miss anything, but he didn't try to sell me on unneeded parts and service either. Great service thus far! n nOne thing I needed was a new tire. I went to pick up my bike but was told that they didn't carry tires in my wheel size. Okay, no big deal. My bike is several years old and the 26 inch wheels are disappearing fast. I bought a tire elsewhere and brought it in. Another mechanic who was working asked me if I knew how to install a tubeless tire. Yes, I do. But is it a bit concerning that the ""bike mechanic "" is asking me how to install a tire?!? He placed a call to another mechanic and was told that he needed Stan's to seal the tire but they they only had full bottles and not the install kit. He didn't know what Stan's was or what an install kit was. Wow. A full service bike shop? I think not. n nSo once again, I left without my bike. A few days later I showed up, with my Stan's Sealant, so that the tire could be installed. Finally, my bike was ready to ride, or so I thought. I had initially brought my bike in because the fork wasn't holding pressure. As I was rolling bike away I put some pressure on the handlebars and the fork when all the way down as there was no pressure in the suspension. Back to the services department I went. I was told that they weren't able to get the proper seal and that I had to take the bike to a Specialized dealer. So I paid for a fork rebuild for a fork that was not functional. This was roughly 100 if I recall correctly. n nI took my bike to Bike Source to have the seal installed. I was charged for a fork rebuild all over again. n nTo sum it up My time was wasted. My money was wasted. Do NOT bring your mountain bike here. They don't have the parts to service a mountain bike and some of the staff could not have less knowledge about mountain bikes. I had to come back to the shop Three times before actually leaving with my bike. And even then it wasn't fixed and I had to take it to another shop. The money that I spent here on a fork rebuild was completely wasted as the job wasn't completed and I had to take my bike to another shop. I may give this shop a try with my road bike. But my fat tire is never going to be serviced here again.",1
stay away tried again with the same bad service sat for over 25 mins and no service had to walk out,1

"Just came back from the restaurant tonight. feel like sharing my experience with people. The environment was very good. Its hard to see such scale of restaurant locally. The server told me that this restaurant cost about 2 million. Each stove cost about 10 grand. The smoke was sucked under neath, so your cloth will not smell after the meal. The menu looks pleasant. beautiful pictures. Service was good. He changed my grill 4 times during the meal. These are all the good parts. Now here comes the food. the appetizer we ordered was spicy tuna volcano. of 1 to 5, I will give it a one. tuna has no flavor, the deep fried rice ball was hard. two very different textures did not match well at all. For the BBQ, I ordered scallop, Kalbi, Harami, Tongue, Chicken fondue. They have 3 kinds of sauce, Ponzu, Sweet Soy, Spicy sauce. The Ponzu was blend with out a kick or freshness. The Sweet soy is too sweet that over powers the meat flavor easily, and you can just tell it was thickened by corn starch. spicy sauce was Korean style base which was still on the sweet side. So I am not impress with the sauce. The scallop was fresh and I have no complaint. But the meat is really just so so. The reason is that the cut was bad. some thick, some thin, some stringy, some wide. they just want to make it to the weight, which is only 4 to 5 oz. per order for 9.00! And they cut the meat along the grain. which is a huge no no for bbq. I feel like they want to cut cost by using the end parts and cut the meat any way they can to make the portion. The marinate was too sweet and overpowering the meat flavor. However the marinate flavor was not too bad, So if you like Korean bbq style, you will like it but If you like real Japanese BBQ, you should go try Yagyu the 2 story building by the China town They do it right. The chicken, they use breast, which is very dry, and the fondue is just not what I am expecting when I am trying to eat bbq. The cheese was overpowering. The chicken was sticking on the grill. The grill they use is metal, really easy to get blacken by the sweet sauce. thats why the server has to change it so often in the middle of your cooking I prefer Yagyu's. They use cast iron grill, you can put a block of beef fat on it to enhance the flavor. And the chicken will not stick. Because yagyu is the first ""Japanese "" bbq place in town, so I compare between the two a lot. For the draft beer, hands down yagyu is far better. The mug was stored below freezing. So when the beer comes, the whole mug is covered with frost and the beer was frozen in side the mug and float to the top. If you are beer lover, you really have to go try Yagyu's draft beer. Tonight's beer just looks sad. And I don't like their rice. To me, a perfectly cooked rice is just as important as the meat. because you eat them together. Rice brand or the type of grain of the rice was not good. For 1.95 a bowl, they should put out something better. Over all, for the environment, and if you want to impress some people, they will do the job. The food is acceptable. But for the bbq, Yagyu is the way to go.",1
"Searching for a brewery that was open on Sundays and came upon Grist. They have an awesome patio area to enjoy a few brews and the inside is inviting and feels like you're hanging out with a few friends. Makes sense since the staff owners are exceptionally friendly down to earth peeps! n nThe place wasn't hard to find as we saw the sign from the road but I can see how it may be tricky depending on where you're coming from. Plenty of parking in their gravel lot. n nWe tried the sampler for 10 and it came with a wheat beer, pale ale, brown ale, red, and a porter. Definitely enough for 2 people to share if you don't mind sharing glasses. I really enjoyed the pale ale it was lighter than what I was expecting with a mild hoppiness following by a floral aftertaste. I got a full glass after trying the sampler. n nAll the beers were good and I really liked the atmosphere. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is b c all the beers were milder than expected and I typically expect craft breweries to push the envelope a bit on the beers they offer. I'm hopeful that since Grist is still new that they may have some ideas in mind for an edgier beer. n nThey have hot dogs, chilli dogs and this pepper veggie medley in olive oil with baguette slices to order. But they also mentioned that you can call places to deliver. Definitely worth checking out! Also very friendly dogs so don't be intimidated if you hear them barking as you walk up.",2
"Came here for my birthday dinner earlier this month since this place has almost 5 stars and figured it would surely be a great experience. n nThere were 5 or 6 other parties dining in addition to my 2 person party it was not a busy night by any means . It took almost 15 minutes for our waiter to even greet us. I mean it was to the point of getting really awkward and I almost walked back up the hostess to ask if we could please just get some water. Finally ordered some water and two mixed drinks. After nearly 10 more minutes, ONE of the mixed drinks arrived. Another 5 or 7 minutes go by and I ask our waiter if my drink is coming and he said 'oh yes it's on it's way'. I get my drink a few more minutes later it only had 2 ingredients according to the menu so I assume he forgot about it somehow. Then I ask if we can please get the waters also at this point we had been there for more than 30 min . n nWe ordered our food and it arrived in an appropriate amount of time. The sushi was good and the green tea tempura ice cream was good too. It's just such a shame that the service was so awful. We had at least 3 different waiters including, I think, a bus boy at one point who clearly didn't have experience waiting tables. What gave that away was when he stopped by our table and pointed at my drink and said ""is that thing any good? "" n nJust a really strange dining experience and the wait staff seem really lost and confused.",1
"I never tasted ""Paradise "" until a recent visit to Arizona. They have some slogan about being known for their cookies. I felt like the gauntlet was thrown, so I took up the challenge. n nI decided to get two chocolate chip cookies. The clerk working here was nice and gave me two for the price of one since it was near the end of the day. The cookies didn't look incredible, but looks can be deceiving. In this case, they weren't. n nMr. L and I waited until our Greyhound Bus ride to Tucson to try them. They were too sugary and did not taste good. We weren't interested in finishing them not worth the calories nor the effort of chewing. Mr. L said Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chip Cookies were better, not that Pepperidge Farm cookies are the pinnacle of greatness or bad either, but I expected better from a bakery that brags about their cookies. n nThe cookies were the perfect 2 star complement to sitting by the bathroom on the back of the Greyhound Bus. n nInstead of finding paradise in the cookie form, it was more like ""Paradise Lost. """,1
"If you're going to hit up a Sushi Mon, go to the one in Henderson. I'm pretty sure this location is where they send their old fish and slow sushi chefs. I swear, I am sitting here watching this guy move as if he's underwater. Maybe he's pretending he is a fish maybe it helps him connect to his job on a spiritual level maybe he just took a little too much NyQuil for that pesky cold he can't kick I don't know. All I know is that I'm hungry and when you're sat by the bathroom you get a lot of poo smell. Double fail.",1
"Went for Ronald's Donuts the other day because of all the positive reviews on the website. Went early afternoon and ordered my favourite Boston Creme, Apple Fritter, Chocolate covered yeast, cake and Bear Claw. n nBleh. n nI guess if you are vegan this stuff might be totally awesome. For the folks can't live without consumption of animal products, I have to say the pasteries are definitely lacking in a couple departments. n nI love yeasty donuts they are a juxtaposition of light, yet substantial, crisp on the outside with a pillow like consistency on the inside. Of these properties, the only criteria Ronald's donuts met was the substantial part by nature of their large portion size. The donut was dry and overly hard on the outside with too much icing making them too sweet . n nBoston Creme lacked both a good quality custard and skimped on the amount of custard although because the custard was so bad it might have been a good thing . n nThe bear claw was really no different than a regular old yeast donut except in its shape. No almond filling, no chocolate. It's just a regular old yeast donut but bigger. n nThe cake donut was again dry and not that appetizing. n nThe apple fritter didn't have enough apples in there, lacked adequate amounts of cinnamon, and like all the other donuts were tried was overly dry which is surprising because they did have some apple bits in there . n nOh, and another thing these donuts, like most, definitely suffer with age. The next day, these stale hard things were like rocks so if you do go out and get some don't get a lot.",1
"This is a nice pub with a relaxed feel inside GVR. We were playing slots and wanted to sit and have a drink. So we decided to go to Quinn's, grab a beer, and play some video poker. The drink prices were extremely reasonable. It seemed like they also have great specials at happy hour. The place was comfortable with plenty of table seating. To the right of the bar is a section with more tables and where I think the live bands play. The band starts at 10 on Saturdays so we missed them. The bartenders are friendly and service is on point. Will definitely come back in for a drink when I'm in GVR.",2
"I'm sorry to see the poor reviews for this restaurant. I was lucky enough to come here late in the evening, almost at closing time so I did not have the wait that other's experienced, and the wait staff was quite attentive. The restaurant itself is lovely inside although you can hear the gaming tables nearby. n nThe menu is on the pricy side but when you are vegan and it is after midnight in Vegas, options are slim so we gave it a try. n nSteve Wynn is vegan so all of his restaurants in his hotels have vegan options on the menu. Something that makes me say, hey Steve, I'm only going to stay in your hotels for the rest of my herbivore life. n nWe had the Pad Thai with tofu. The dish was incredibly delicious and the tofu was cooked perfectly. Believe it or not, tofu can sometimes be a challenge to cook without it being rubbery and there were two varieties of tofu in this dish. My husband and I split an order and I was left wishing I wasn't sharing. We also shared some dim sum appetizers which were unique and cooked to perfection. n nAs a nice touch, the coffee we really good, served with and I'm not sure of the actual name of this the little stick with the sugar crystals on it. The kids thought this was great. n nEven though we were there after closing time, they did not rush us and we enjoyed every moment of our experience. Can't wait to get back to Vegas and eat at Red 8 again.",2
"Since our Ob Gyn had moved to another state, I asked my friend a nurse at Gateway's labor and delivery unit if she could refer a Doctor that could perform a great repeat c section and that had a good personality. She told me about Dr. Layton. I had liked my last doctor that delivered my boys via c section , but I think I love Dr. Layton even more! I had our first appointment this week, and my husband and I were impressed with the details given how he would answer our questions! He was kind, very clear, and wanted us to be happy with his work. Not an erogant Doc thinking its about them, but that it's about our needs and the baby's needs. He took his time with us we really are looking forward to our future visits delivery!",2
"It was my first visit, sometime in the late evening, me and my boyfriend wanted to get take out. They were not ready to make certain sushi we were ordering from the menu so we were limited to what was already made by the chef Understandable. Maybe it was near closing time, and remaking certain items may be a hassle but on the contrary, why are you running a restaurant? Then, as we are waiting for our take out, I grab two chopsticks from the reception one for me and one for my boyfriend . The lady bring us our take out in a plastic bag and the moment she sees that I am carrying two chopsticks in my hand, she reaches down to the plastic bag, and removes the two chopsticks she had initially put, then she grabs the chopsticks from my hand, and throws it back into the bag. Really? What if I had friends waiting at home to share the sushi with me? It was two boxes of sushi that could be shared afterall. I had to ""request "" for extra chopsticks after being denied my order from the menu YOU had provided? What harm would have done if she had kept the chopsticks she had initially put in the plastic bag instead of making me feel like chopsticks were a rare commodity. I'm sorry but a little customer service goes a long way in the hospitality business. However, the sushi wasn't bad even though it wasn't the ones of our initial choice. Next time I visit, I'll make sure I visit at a time where you will make the sushi I order and keep in mind how scarce chopsticks are. IF there is a next time.",1
"I brought the family out for a fun weekend prior to a conference that I was attending at this hotel the following week. A great hotel for the kids with plenty of places to walk and lots to do. n nThe girls loved the relay races and cannonball contests in the pool and the watermelon eating contest and of course swimming and the water slide. n nWe didn't have a car so we didn't venture off property. Eating on the property and going to Rawhide old western town brought back to life very fun, but clearly a tourist trap were nice the food was good , but rather expensive. It was a vacation though and eating on resort is always going to be expensive. n nOne of my daughters has food allergies and the staff was usually very accommodating allowing her to substitute something in her meal for something that she wasn't allergic to without additional charge. Once we were charged several dollars extra for having to substitute fruit for something else and unfortunately they made only a VERY vain effort to try and remediate the situation. I expected better from that experience, but that was a one off in what was otherwise a very fun, very relaxing weekend.",2
"Went in today to get an acrylic set. Was greeted by a male worker and asked what I wanted. I proceeded to tell him that I wanted an acrylic set with a french manicure with an oval tip, easy right? He says yes they do that and a lady proceeds to help me. I tell her I want oval tips and she takes the next 3 minutes to try and tell me that its a bad idea and that it wont work.even though I've gotten it done exactly that way many times at other salons. She proceeded to glue white tips on my bitten nails and I ask her why when that will make half of my nail white not the tip like french nails. Then she yells at me that I asked for white tips and that its my fault. Needless to say I had her remove them and left. I do NOT recommend this place. Yes it may be 10 cheaper than other salons but they are RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL. Went on to command other customers as I left. Do not try this place.",1
"We wanted to grab a frozen hot chocolate for a late afternoon snack. Well, the wait at 4 pm on a Monday was so long for 2 people that we ended up eating dinner. I had the veggie burger, which is housemade and served with a spicy roumalade and avocado slices. It was really, really good. The sesame bun was grilled crispy, but the inside was soft. Probably the best veggie burger I've had. n nI got the Cole Slaw as my side and it wasn't good at all. It was the prepackaged, mayo based kind so unless you like that kind of thing, stay away. I tried a few of my friend's fries though and they were good. n nThe frozen hot chocolate was disappointing though. I have not been to the original, but my friend had and she said it was not the same. It came out melted and didn't have the strong, rich chocolate flavor I was expecting. n nOh, and we sat outside on the patio facing Las Vegas Blvd in June it was in the 90s and it was hot, but not uncomfortable. I actually enjoyed the water misting fans.",1
"This is a great Chipotles.they are always fast, the food is always fresh and the tables are pretty much always clean. I've been here a few times and the manager has been around checking up on things. They mean business! Good business, that is!",2
"This place is a nightmare especially if you are in the pickup line. I went there to pick up keys and after over an hour wait the clerk said they don't have them it's bc it's a new house it's the builders fault. Really?!? She said they will hold the mail for me to come back and to contact my builder. What do you mean the builder? Anyway, I came back today, waited again and to find out the previous clerk didn't do anything to hold the mail. They let me know that they lost my keys, they don't have my mail, it's their fault and they will rush my keys which will take 2 4weeks. In the meantime, keep coming back and wait in this stupid unorganized place to receive my mail. I wish the post office became obsolete completely. Thankful for UPS and FEDEX!",1
"On our recent trip to Vegas from the New England, we were craving ramen. Having lived in Hawaii and Los Angeles, and frequenters of Ippudo in New York, you can consider us ramen fiends. n nFOOD We ordered tonkotsu ramen and tonkotsu shoyu ramen it's NOT ""tonKATsu, "" people! , gyoza, kimchi fried rice, pork belly bowl, and mini mentaiko bowl. Yes, a lot of food for 3, but again, we're fatties! I could not finish my ramen this NEVER happens! , because the broth was too oily and too salty. It was saltier and oilier than any kotteri broth I've ever had, really inedible. The noodles were perfectly cooked though we ordered katamen firm noodles so that's a confounder , though. I was sad that I couldn't eat more of the noodles because the oily broth was just too much of a turn off. The side dishes, though, were SUPER good. The gyoza was steamed and fried perfectly, so I was glad. The kimchi fried rice was very tasty and the kick of sour kimchi was really good. The pork belly bowl was pretty good, but I still LOVE the one from Daikokuya in LA. The mentaiko bowl was also good, per my husband, as I don't particularly enjoy mentaiko. n nAMBIANCE par for the course for a ramen shop. n nSERVICE attentive and appropriate to assure quick turnovers during rush time! lots of enthusiastic greetings like most ramen shops. There was a reasonable wait about 20 minutes when we went at lunch time. n nVALUE decently priced! didn't break the bank like Ippudo does P n nPARKING ample parking outside! n nOverall, ramen in LA is still the best on the west coast!",2
"Cannot get enough of this place! n n great location n n all the tables seem to have privacy, yet you still can see whats going on. n n the toilet paper is stamped with their logo This means they got somethin' good going on I'm sure n n cheap during happy hour n n super cheap during happy hour 5 pitchers everyday foo ' I think between 11 and 5 n n Special 20 wine bruschetta thingy. n n hot staff.except one guy yelled at me and my friend for smoking in the parking lot on our way to our bikes.whatevs. we quit anyways! n n not too many douchey customers that I've encountered n n oh, and best hoegarden on tap i have ever tasted! n nwin winw inwinwinwinwinwinwi wiiiiin! nPostinos.FTW!",2
"Something for everyone here! n nPizza lovers will enjoy the dozen red and white pizza selections. n nHealthy eaters will love the white bean arugula and red onion salad and the mushroom soup, a flavorful broth with mushrooms and carrots. n nAnd the desserts! Amaretto milkshake to go they can't put in booze and a at least 5 gelato choices. n nThe wine list is great and most comes by the glass. n nAND the prices! So low! n nTwo can split a pizza for 15 16. The soup comes with two small pieces of their specialty flatbread and just 4 dollars. n nRicotta cheescake 7. n nEverything here is cheaper than the SB equivalent, Olio Pizzeria, though to be fair, Olio Pizzeria the bistro version of the fancy Olio e Limone, Julia Child's favorite Italian restaurant in SB has more composed and sophisticated appetizers and also charcuterie. n nBut this is a GEM. Spectacular food, affordable good wine you can pay 12 glass but most is in the 7 to 9 range and they have two choices for 6 glass , cute decor. n nIt's slow at night but I went at lunch this time on Black Friday. They do a big lunch business but the businesses were closed and everyone shopping so it was deserted. n nIf you live in Scottsdale, this should be on your list!",2
CKs is your neighborhood bar restaurant. The wings special on Tuesdays is great! Staff is friendly!,2
"We've had some good experiences here, especially with Sunday brunch. Today was a little off. It's a Saturday and we dropped in for lunch. We ordered the special that the waitress told us about. Fish tacos. They were really more of an appetizer with just two tacos on a plate and a half a lime. I should have asked the price. 15 for two tacos 'on special' is ridiculous. A 40 tab for 4 tacos and 2 iced teas? The food was good but I feel ripped off. I won't be rushing back.",1
"I had previously been to Switch and had a mediocre experience with their breakfast and cocktails. nThis past Saturday 3 of my friends and I decided to give it a try before we passed judgement. Three of us order burgers medium rare with salad, the burgers looked as though they were straight from package with grill lines already on them. One of my friends picked up his burger to take a bite out of it and greased poured out of it. The Cesar dressing had to come from a bottle as the salad was definitely bag salad. To add insult to injury our waiter was incompetent at best and had zero personality",1
"Everything about the service and food of this place was mediocre. Our waters were never refilled and I felt like we were ignored the entire time. We got sat right away, but waited for quite awhile for our food to come out. I wouldn't mind waiting, but there was barely anyone in the place. My mother had the noodle salad which was decent and fresh. I ordered a beef pho and it was terrible. The broth was bland and the noodles weren't even cooked all the way. PLEASE try Pho Thanh or other great pho places in the area if you think the pho here is actually good. This place is over priced and over rated for what it actually is.",1
We had to go to the west side of Phoenix and that was just the excuse for another dinner at Pappadeaux. n nThis time we were there in the middle of the week so there was no wait for a table. n nWe went the same route on the appetizers with alligator and oysters. No sense messing with perfection. n nThe hubby ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. Expensive but fabulous. I stole a couple of bites and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. Heavenly! n nI wasn't very hungry after appetizers so I just had a bowl of Lobster Bisque. HUGE chunks of lobster in there and so warm and satisfying. This will be my choice from now on if I'm not feeling super hungry. n nPappadeaux definitely has my vote as the best seafood place in Phoenix.,2
"Even though there are not many good Mexican restaurants in Matthews or Charlotte, they still need to have expectations. Even though the food was decent, the service was TERRIBLE. We couldn't understand a word the waiters where saying, mostly because they were hardly whispering to us. Their thick accents mixed with the whispering was very difficult to understand. On top of that, we had about a 15 minute wait for just drinks, and about a 40 minute wait to get our food. We had seven people with us, and three of them didn't fully enjoy the food, and one of them hardly ate any of it. The most enjoyable part of the restaurant was there nice bathrooms. n nOver all we were disappointed and probably will not return to this restaurant.",1
Seriously some of the best breakfast ever! The steak and eggs for under 10 is just unbelievable considering you could feed 3 with it!,2
"Before a recent night out with a large group of friends, we came to Houlihan's for drinks and appetizers. The atmosphere felt a little traditional and dated. Even though it was Saturday evening, the restaurant was practically empty, and our party of 15 or so really had an entire wing of the place to ourselves. n nBoth the service and food were unimpressive. We had two waitresses helping out the table, and the waitress helping my end of the table had an odd personality. As soon as someone would join the table literally as they were still saying ""hello "" to the group she would dash over and ask for their order. I'm pretty sure that everyone had to tell her to give them a few minutes before they could order. Her pouncing tactic made the new arrival feel awkward and start searching the menu quickly before they could even settle down. She seemed nice enough otherwise but just needed some common sense and better training. n nI ordered a liter of Long Island Iced Tea to share with my husband, but since he wasn't a fan of the flavor, he ordered an additional liter. I normally would be tipsy after 3 drinks, but this entire liter didn't even get me buzzed. We also ordered the White Bean Artichoke Hummus, which wasn't very special. It all tasted like something that I could've gotten in an average grocery store.",1
This place is a little bit of heaven. They do an amazing job to relax you and make you feel wonderful. So worth the price very affordable. You will feel like a brand new women when you leave here.,2
"The service was great, food healthy and delicious, yet affordable, the outside patio charming. If I could take a restaurant home with me, this would be my choice!",2
"I was in the mood for Mexican and immediately when I saw this place, my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We both were disappointed. First, our waitress took awhile to ask us what we wanted to drink. Then, we stated we needed additional time to look at the menu and I kid you not, she gave us 30 second no joke and came back to see if we were ready. We stated no, we needed a few minutes, and she came back 1 minute later, and we just kinda looked at her confused, why was she rushing us to order? n nThen, we made our decision, closed our menus and waited over 15 minutes for her to take our order and the restaurant was not business . n nYou have to pay for Chips and Salsa which was so so. I ended up ordering a Steak Burrito and it came with Rice Beans. The rice and beans were not tasty and the burrito was stuffed with the same rice and beans and barely any meat. Did not enjoy. Also, our waitress never came to the table to ask us for refills or even for the bill. After finishing our meal, we probably waited 15 20 minutes before flagging her down asking for the bill. Mind you it still was not busy. I will definitely not be back to this restaurant.",1
"This is a fantastic service. The women are obviously dedicated and really know how to handle even the fussiest of cats. Mine is a male and is not afraid to react if touched in the wrong place. She handles him marvelously. Not sure if they're non profit but very professional. Just in case you've never had your cat groomed before, may I suggest that you do not get the belly shaved as it exposes his teats and he keeps lickig the fur around it. I will not get his belly shaved again, but they even clean the ears and shave the hair in between the toes on the paws. Try it you'll like it.",2
"Hotel check in policy is an absolute JOKE! For such a very serious reason, I am unable to give Square Phillips a rating higher than 1 star. n nI knew ahead of time that my arrival at the hotel will be very late, so I called them ahead of time, where the customer service person made a note on the computer that I would be checking in late. n nUpon my arrival, I was VERY shocked to find out my friend who got there before me was able to check into the hotel, even though his name was never mentioned in a booking, nor was his credit card used to pay for the booking. n nHe was able to check in because according to the front desk person, the chances of somebody knowing the name of the person who booked as well as when they booked is very slim, therefore, they are able to let him check in. I find this to be quite ridiculous that a hotel can let anybody check in based on providing those 2 pieces of information. n nWithout factoring the above incident, this hotel would receive a 3.5 5 star rating from me. n nThe location of the hotel is very good, and is close to many places. On top of that, the cleanliness of the hotel is also very good. The general area outside the hotel, the lobby, the hallways, and the room are all very clean. The hotel also provides free breakfast, which includes items such as toast, muffins, cereal, yogurt, and fruit. For those that aren't picky about the limited selection and lack of hot foods, or those that want something that 'gets the job done', free food is always good! n nThe room we stayed in was a family suite, and it was very spacious and has everything you'd expect from an apartment room. There's a small kitchen with fridge, stove, dining table, and a microwave, there is also a private bedroom and also a second one that is open and connected to the living room area. The bathroom was quite spacious, but don't expect anything fancy. n nFor the cons, customer service from the night crew was okay at best. They aren't particularly helpful or friendly, but at them same time they aren't rude and unprofessional. The quality of customer service can definitely be better. n nThe pricing of the rooms and parking valet park only are also on the higher end. For the price that we paid Approx. 1000 for 3 nights valet parking for 2 nights I think there is a fair bit of room for improvement, as we compared it to Westin Hotel, which seems more higher end for the same price.",1
"Lonnie, n nI understand why you must charge more. I really do. What angers me is suggesting repairs I don't even need! This is the second time this has been done. The first time was to replace brakes that I thought were fine. I took my truck to a brake shop and they said there was absolutely NOTHING wrong with my brakes. It was a YEAR later that they needed replacement! This time it was for a multitude of front end work that didn't need to be done. I would much rather give my business to a shop that wants my repeat business through honest means, than by adding repairs that ""could "" be done, but don't ""need "" to be done. n nJohn",1
"one of the great things about Edinburgh is the number of independent running shops that are on offer. being a gym fitness enthusiast and attempting to be a serious runner i have a fairly big need of these shops and Run 4 It is definitely the best. i had a brief visit here last year to get some new running kit and found the shop assistants helpful and willing to chat about my needs and give me a number of options. n non friday afternoon i stopped in to buy a new pair of trainers as mine were looking pretty worn from training for a half marathon. as soon as i stepped in the door i was approached by a shop assistant to ask what i was looking for and if he could help. now what's really awesome about this shop is that when i said i needed running shoes, he showed me to a seat and sat down to talk to me about what sort of running i did. when i confirmed i did the majority of my running outside on the pavement and a bit of running on the treadmill, he then asked that i take off my shoes and socks to get on their shop treadmill to see what my gait looked like. like the other reviews mention i was recorded running on the treadmill and then we watched the feedback to decide what sort of support i would need from a trainer. the good news was that i had a fairly straight gait and didn't have too much movement when running, so just needed all around good support. i tried three pairs of trainers on and was on and off the treadmill to see how i ran in them. i liked that the guy asked my opinion on how the shoes felt and what i looked like running in them. it made me feel involved in what i was buying and not just being told what i should get. n nafter deciding on trainers i asked about getting some new running kit, in particular a pair of compression tights. unlike a chain shop, the shop assistant asked me if i had any injuries or was prone to them as that was the only reason i would need compressoion tights. when i said i didn't have injuries he then took me round to look at a few pairs of normal running tights as he assured me that these would suit my needs. i really appreciate that i wasn't talked into buying kit that was over twice as expensive as the tights i did end up buying. especially as it's unlikely they would have benefited me at all. i did try on a range of different running tights before deciding on an awesome nike pair that had two side pockets instead of one along the back. much more useful for me! n nso overall, a really fantastic experience at this shop! i really like that the people who work here are so knowledge and ready to help. also that they don't try to talk you into buying more expensive things just to make money. i did spend a fair bit of money over u00a3130 for shoes, running tights, and socks but i felt it was well worth it to help keep me safe and supported for the rest of my training. i will definitely be heading back here for any other running needs i may have!",2
"yelp should have 0 or feedback system, I would have gave this place 10. The worst food and service I have ever had. Lets make it clear this is resraurant owned by a Persian guy and yet he does not know how to make his own food, how the hell are you going to maintain the rest of the stuff that are none Persian. n nA I waited 25 minutes for my food with nothing on my table! When you eat Persian food as soon as you get in they will need to bring you warm bread with butter with mixed vegtables and onion this is a must at the table. After getting deinks Then the server needs to ask you if you would need any salad, yougurt mix cucumber or shallot and then get your order. Kind of like how they bring you tortilla chips at Mexican food before you wait for your food. n nAfter a long wait and my moms complain to Anthony the food came, I dont know what word to use but it was garbage and I mean litterly garbage. Tasteless, spiceless crab with premium pricing.My sister only ate the salad from her koobideb friends order was supposet to have white rice but it came with a garbage brownish mixed rice so they brought him another plate of white rice also servers learn your job chicken is always served with lemon on the plateand make sure it is not burned. My trio had dried, seasonless koobideh with burned chicken along with half cooked koobideh. n nAnd the combination plate was another disaster, flavorless tastless stuff. We didnt eat a good portion of the food my mom said its not nice to be wastefull so she brought the food back for our little dog coco and guess what even coco did not eat the food she only ate the meats lol. n nI found this place by doing a google search and they had two locations so I figured it must be good, oh boy I was mistaken. A note to everyone going here, if you are eating here you do not know what kabob should taste like and keep in my you are eating the worst kind possible. So do your self and your body a favor and go elsewhere",1
"Before heading back to California, we decided to stop here for some pizza. The Bianca was delicious. We also had the meat and cheese platter which was amazing. Although we were extremely hungover, we tried and failed to drink some strawberry bellinis. They were good, but I bet a lot better when you weren't imaging the bottle of Whisky sitting in your stomach. n nOverall, great little pizza place. Definitely worth a try if you're in the hood.",2
I sat at the bar to have some dinner. Ordered the hanger steak which was about 26. It was cooked medium rare like i instructed. It was served over some potatoes Brussel sprouts. My disappointment was that it was cold. The cold steak made it crewy and difficult to eat. I took 2 bites and told the waiter that the steak was cold and i was not happy. He told me well its really cold in here so you kinda have eat it quick. What? I wont come back here. I cant believe i was served a COLD steak,1
"We had a meeting catered by Mimi's. I had no control over what was ordered. Some brilliant person decided to order turkey dinner a week before Thanksgiving. WTH? Ok fine, let me start my Thanksgiving early. Why not? n nWe got turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy and cranberry sauce. I ate the turkey and mashed potatoes and gravy. Some people in our group decided to eat something else and not touch the catered food from Mimi's. I should have done the same. I was sick for a week until Thanksgiving day and so were the other unsuspecting victims . Damn, you turkey! You destroyed my stomach! n nAll the other times I've eaten at this location and other locations were just alright. Nothing really stands out from their menu. A few pounds lighter, I'd like to thank who ever handled cooked the food at our meeting for not letting me gain any holiday weight. I doubt I'll ever eat order food from there again.unless if I want to lose weight quick without even trying.",1
"Great place to go with the family. The major attraction is the lazy river. You can drop an innertube in the water and float around and around endlessly. n nThe restaurants are actually quite good and the vista from the restaurants is really nice as well. If you like spas I highly recommend you visit the one here. They have great facials and massages. n nThe entryway is jaw dropping with a gigantic fallaway atrium and the lounge that overlooks a courtyard. n nGuestrooms are in pristine condition, and the housekeeping is on target.",2
"10 19 10 and 01 02 11 n nTook Mom w me for her first visit to St. Francis and my second! for a late lunch around 1p. The place was packed, and as usual, very noisy. Thought perhaps I'd finally get a chance to see how the seating was upstairs, but we were seated on the main floor. Even though we were seated right away, it took more than 10 minutes before our server finally greeted us. n nEven though I knew what I'd order for us both, I let Mom look over the limited menu for once, the lengthy downtime worked to our advantage! She almost went for the lunch combo soup, salad, and half of the Del Real sandwich , but in the end, we ordered the two items I already had my eye on before we'd left home love to read menus online! . We decided to share the French onion burger and the Red wine braised beef, and both came w a choice of fries or red quinoa salad, so we chose one of each. The burger was a beauty! On a substantial and gruyere smothered patty lay greens, smoked bacon, and crispy shoestring onions, and these were all topped w a gorgeous bun! We wouldn't hesitate to order this one again! While the fries looked very promising, they were soggy, but Mom happily ate them. I had the Red wine braised beef sandwich and the red quinoa salad to contend w , so I didn't bother sending the fries back. n nWe both loved the quinoa salad what a pleasant surprise! Red quinoa is very good for you high in fiber AND protein. A superfood, indeed! The key to this salad was the citrus vinaigrette. A must try! The braised beef was also very, very good! That is, when we finally tried it w the horseradish sauce, which somehow was overlooked while Mom and I were divvying up the entrees. Panini style, between two slices of their Texas toast, buttered, and gruyere cheese. DO NOT forget the horseradish sauce, as it just makes the flavors pop in your mouth. n nWhen I'd learned that Dennis Rowland was in the house during Sunday brunch, I couldn't wait to go to SF on a rare Sunday off work! Again, it was a packed house, and I finally was seated upstairs. Oh my Lord, what a horrendous place to be! While I could hear Rowland and his band play it's actually less noisy up there go figure , I couldn't see them, what w the rafters and the ceiling fans underneath, and the cork flooring made every footstep coming and going annoyances I couldn't wait to get rid off by finally leaving! Thank goodness the two entrees I'd ordered made up for these. hiccups. n nLiked the Iron skillet pancake w dark chocolate chips and fresh raspberries , but thought the kitchen was a little light handed on the chips please add more! Also, I found the pancake was charred too much. I thought it was bec. it was skillet style, but I spied another table that received a perfectly un charred one. Really enjoyed the creme fraiche and fresh raspberries please add more! , and the honey on the bottom of the pancake was delightful! A great dish, really, even w the charred bits. As for the house made biscuit well, one look at it and who could ever argue that it wouldn't taste grand? Crazy good fennel herb veggie gravy. Yes, I said ""crazy good. "" There's a first time for everything! n nTwo very good meals which will keep St. Francis on my long rotation list! BTW, I think I heard Mom sigh when I told her where I was having brunch while she was getting ready work. I really wished I could've taken her w me! n np.s. Not only did I not get a chance to SEE Rowland and his band play, but for the majority of my stay, the band actually took a break! No doubt they were all enjoying some of the great looking cinnamon rolls. Next time, I'm going to wait for a table to open on the main floor. That cork flooring upstairs has to go!",2
"Quaker Steak Lube was my go to place for wings in Madison. I'll admit, I never had anything other than wings here, and that would continue to be the trend whenever I'm back in the area. n nIf you're up for it, Tuesdays are the days to go here. 13 for all you can eat wings and I must praise the wings for their quality. I love how Quaker Steak Lube has a lot of flavors and seasonings for their wings. I'd say between 20 25. I believe they implemented new dry rubs within the past year or so and they were pretty good. n nOverall, superior wings and good atmosphere, bar, and lots of TVs.",2
"I love Treehouse Bakery! It happens to be about a 20 second walk from my house so I love to pop in and bring some delicious treats home. My favorite cupcakes are their champagne and macaroon cupcakes, but the classic vanilla and chocolate are always a great choice too. My boyfriend loves their homemade poptarts as well. If you're looking for a refreshment then try one of their iced teas. They have a selection of 3 herbal teas, locally sourced I believe. I forgot what the tea I got was called but it was minty and delicious!",2
"The only thing that's nice about this nail salon is the layout and pretty sky ceiling. Besides that, the people who work there don't give a crap, their massages are shitty and they burnt both me and my friends legs with their hot rocks. For what we got, their prices were outrageous! I won't pay a dime to come back here. They also told me my daughters polish change would be 3 and then charged me 5 without letting me know!",1
"Horrible! I was hungry for a green chili burro and remembered this place was right off the freeway. Pull up to the drive thru window and see a sign saying, "" 50 cent charge for debit credit "", no big deal as im hungry. The lady opens the window and i see flys creepin out. I counted at least a dozen, which prompted me to leave but again i was hungry so i decided to stick around. n nI get my burro and to my surprise its heavy! Im thinkin ahh yea bout to grub. First bite into it and all i get is rice! Not good rice but rice thats bland as all hell. Who puts rice in a green chili burro?!?! I unwrap it and all there is is rice, beans and shredded beef. no green chili. how is this even called a green chili burro with no chili. n nIm leaving one star for the fact that. n Tons of Flys were present inside the building n Rice was bland and overcooked nMeat was flavorless n No green chili! n nOn a brighter note the beans and tortilla were pretty good. but not 6.51 good. Avoid this place and go hit up nicos by the little caesar. There food is actually good!",1
If I could give this place zero stars I would! n nI moved into shade apartments in February and I just finally got out of my lease. The office staff are useless and the maintenance guys are even more useless! n nThe complex has good facilities but they need to maintain them better. n nI've lived in apartment complexes all over the world and this place is the worst. n nKatie in the office is the only one who has any clue about customer service. Asked to deal with her only one that can do their job! n nThe manager lady is about as useless as legs on a snake and couldn't organise a drink in a pub with a handful of 50 bills! n nI'm so happy to be out of there it's very close to being a ghetto! n nRant over! DON'T LIVE HERE!,1
I needed a ride from my house to the doctor in the morning so i called Vip the day before. I explained to them that I need the driver to wait outside for 10 minutes at the doctor and drive me back. They took down all my information and told me the ride was set up. The taxi arrived on time the next day and it was very clean. The driver waited very patiently and was very courteous the whole time. I was so happy with my experience and I will for sure use them again and encourage others too as well.,2
"I love this place. Located in Aria Hotel, it is not only beautiful and trendy looking but the pastries are so good. Hubby and I ordered almond croissant 4 each , cappuccino, and cafe au lait. OMG the biggest, beautiful, and delicious almond croissant ever. Huge size, fresh almond slices on top, generous amount of almond butter inside, flaky and so buttery. We were there 4 nights, 5 days and ate there 4 times. We also tried the location at Bellagio's and quality wasn't was good. I wished they had more locations but it seems like it is only in Vegas. Also tried dulce de leche brioche kinda dry bread and too much dulce. Would stick with the almond croissant u must try it at least once.",2
I ordered a pizza and he the crust was doughy,1
"All around good bar. Lot's of bike parking and they have a huge out door patio. It's not covered so is nice if you want to get some sun when the weather is nice. There are misters out there for when it's hot. They have a great selection of beer and I've liked every food item I've ordered. The staff is also great. n nI recently started going to team trivia. It's a lot of fun. They start promptly at 630. Punctuality is not our strong suit so our group ends up trickling in during the first few questions but still a fun time. We do not win. n nCouple things though I cannot forget to bring up but will not effect my rating. n1 Get that beer menu back on the chalkboard. Like seriously, it was amazingly useful. We all agree that it is a tragedy it is not there. n2 They don't have cherries.This practically made my friend cry. I do not support this. n n shout out to our awesome server last week Lauren. Great food recommendations as well!",2
Found a wire in the served spaghetti. A waitress took it away without any apology. Really bad service and the food is plain. We don't recommend this restaurant.,1
"As mentioned above, the company seems to be named ABM Appliance Repair now with the same phone number. They were sent to my house in the SF Bay Area by a home warranty company for a washer repair. n nThe technician came in a personal, non marked minivan. He was wearing jeans and a polo shirt, with absolutely no company identification. He pretty much went on to do absolutely nothing. He had absolutely no tools and didn't even look inside the washer. n nHis verdict. the washer runs fine despite the fact that the motor hasn't worked on the previous two loads during the wash cycle , I suggested that we try with actual clothes in the washer. He refused and said it doesn't matter. n nBasically, he did nothing. I refused to pay him. n nUnfortunately the way First American Home Warranty works is that they send out a different technician from the same company. How stupid! n nI put in a load as he was leaving and sure enough, it doesn't work. The motor runs but it doesn't spin.",1
"Customer service! Someone still has it this day in age! After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at Dillard's, I simply gave up, walked into Nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat! To the employee who helped me Hats off to you good sir!",2

"I have been living here for a few months now and everything was pretty good up until recently. The Roman tubs are amazing and the people at the front seemed friendly enough. Always get maintenence out pretty quick. Plus you can pay your rent online! But lately some bad things. There have been upwards of five different occasions they've had to completely shut off water. For very long periods of time, 6 to 8 hours right in the middle of the day. Then they have to audacity to raise our water payment. What just occurred, I had a sticker on my car window saying I had 48 hours to renew my registration or I will be towed. I tried to explain to the management that I renewed online and the decal will be here in a few days. She just kept asking when and I kept telling her however long the mail takes. Still waiting to see if my car gets towed. Is my rent going towards them hiring a tow company to come tow my car out of my designated parking space? Not impressed.",1
I believe this location has closed and should be removed as a listing,1
"Food is good. Restaurant was cold, literally as evidenced by other people wearing their coats and the server Chris telling us ""someone else said that "". Took forever to get service. Server spilled water on the table when trying to fill a glass then spilled wine on the table when trying to fill a glass. Water is one thing I'm paying for the wine he poured on the table. I ordered a salad with dinner, it never showed up. Not worth a second visit.",1
"The Capri on Camelback has an amazing location! Walking distance to newly opened Fresh and Easy, Chelsea's Kitchen, Vincent's, Postino, LGO, and the Vig. It's exactly what you want in walking distance to home. n nFrom the looks of it from the outside, it looks drab and boring, but inside, the apartments are quite nice. nothing to write home about, but nice. n nWhy the low score? The Parking is a nightmare! It's the worst possible thing I can imagine! To go through that headache every single day is become too much. Every car is parked within inches INCHES of each other. and to top it off my truck has been spit on twice. The staff knows little to nothing. The laundry is expensive. And it's like college where every other night a fire alarm gets pulled. Plus, every single morning from between 7 10 am they are dragging metal dumpsters or trimming the hedges or cutting the grass or blowing the grass or etc, etc, etc. You CANNOT sleep in with the windows open. even weekends. n nBut the worst thing. in an apartment complex with easily well over 500 people living here, there is NO RECYCLING!

"I don't write that many reviews for places but I just had to for this one in particular. I didn't really have a good experience with this hotel after not traveling to Las Vegas for almost 8 years and coming back to see a hotel that didn't meet my expectations was terrible. n nThis is primarily because of 3 things, customer service issue, key for the hotel room, and unwashed bed sheets and covers. What can I say about the customer service issue? One of the ladies who was in charge of hotel admission did not help at all with a simple room key problem. I rented the hotel room with a couple of friends and my name was not registered within the hotel room. The lady told me she couldn't do anything about fixing the hotel room key because my name was not listed for the room and she said ""I'm sorry. "" I wasn't with my friends at this time because they were out having some fun in the casinos. Basically I was stuck in my hotel and I wasn't planning to wait hours for them to come back. I went back to the floor where my room was and then back downstairs again at the hotel admission but this time a different lady helped me out and she was able to let me get back in my room. n nThe key for the hotel room was a disaster and such a hassle. The keys that were given to my friends and I kept malfunctioning and we'd have to go back upstairs and downstairs constantly in order to fix it. n nLastly, the bed sheet covers and the pillow covers were not washed. They smelled really bad like someone's sweat was on the covers.",1

"My husband and I snagged a travelzoo voucher and decided to stay here for a night. The resort is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly. If you're looking for a quiet and quaint getaway this is the place to go. The pool was smaller than expected but we were there in July so it wasn't crowded and the cabana staff was very accommodating. My two issues were the food menu was quite limited although they do offer a happy hour which is nice, but only offer certain foods at certain times, which is frustrating , and my pedicure at the spa was below average.",2

"The bar is located in the lobby of the Downtown Grand Las Vegas. It is oddly NOT open 24 7. Well, since it only has two walls an open design to the lobby , it's never technically closed and allows loitering. We were there on a Friday night and the bartenders left around midnight? No warning either. I also didn't see any signs showing their hours. n nA group of us were in the area for dinner, so we decided to check out Downtown Grand and settled on Art Bar based on its vibe nice decor, beautiful furniture, and relaxing . That was probably the only enjoyable part of our evening. The bartender tended to us rather quickly, which was very nice. I chose the ""Mozart "" from their cocktails menu composed of Ketel One vodka, Midori, and a splash of pineapple juice. My friend chose the ""Monet "" Hennessy cognac, fresh lemon juice, and simple syrup . The drinks were all right and after discovering the Yelp check in offer of a free cocktail with cocktail purchase, we stuck with our beverages. n nWhat followed was an odd experience. The bartender was unfamiliar with the check in offer and continued to tell me that it was for the ""other Art Bar "" um, what? He claimed it was the one located inside the Mob Museum the Mob Bar? . I said, ""No, it's here "" while showing him photos of the bar that was posted on their Yelp page. He looks at my phone again and asks if he can take it to his boss. He comes back with the same confusion because his boss is not available, but then says ""okay "" to the offer. n nSo, besides the bartender trying to convince me that there was another Art Bar when he didn't know about the Yelp check in, he also forgot an ingredient in one of their signature cocktails, so my friend had to take it back there were only three ingredients . Oh, and he called it a Mo NET. Fail. n nMy advice? Avoid this bar! There are SO MANY other competent bars in Vegas!",1

"I had several personal firsts at this restaurant Escargot, raw oysters and duck, all of which I ended up liking, espcially their duck and the escargot. The oysters were ok, but not something that I would rave about and crave like a lot of people do. For my main mean I ordered their roasted lamb with a side of asparagus and it was also very good. Nice restaurant inside and good service. For dessert I had the lemon tart which was good but not something I would order again. My friend had the chocolate dessert which was much better. Also, you have a pretty good view of the strip from the balcony.",2

"To be honest, when I was in need of a key for my vehicle Pop A Lock Charlotte was very quick to respond. They gave me a good rate and had someone to my home to re key my car. The gentleman who came to my home was courteous and efficient. I had requested 2 keys, 1 with an automatic door opener, 1 without. He made me the 1 without and stated he did not have the blanks to make the other but would call me once they came in, about a week or so. Well He never called and I am a busy person so I just went about my business figuring I would eventually get the key made. nFast forward several months, as I was getting into my car which I use for business the key broke in half. I was in front of a clients home, many miles from my own home. I contacted the 800 number and explained the situation. The woman on the phone explained that there was no locksmith on duty and after less than stellar customer service stated she would send a message. That was around 8pm. I had to have my car towed to my house, since I could not get into it, or drive it. At 9 30 the following morning I contacted Pop A Lock as NO ONE HAD CALLED ME BACK. Again a message was sent, this time with a response. I spoke with Brook apologize if misspelled , he advised me that it would cost 195 for a new key. Exasperated I reiterated the situation, that the key broke in half, clearly a flaw with the key I did not use it for anything other than driving and feel that its less than 1 year lifespan is indicative of that fact. He stated he would talk to his manager and call me back, which he did. I was then quoted the cost of 95. Again, I explained my issue with having to pay for a key that was flawed. nI have an issue with paying for something that should last the life of a vehicle, the key they were replacing had fallen off of a truck left it accidentally on the bumper and ran over who knows how many times on Lawyers Rd before I finally found it the next day and it hadn't broken the chip was demolished though . So I have a hard time believing that there was anything less than a flaw in the key, maybe a mistake was made while grinding it that caused that particular weakness, who knows. nWhat I do know is having to repay a company for a product that should have lasted longer than 1 year is frustrating. nAs I am writing this review Edwin, the owner of Pop A Lock Charlotte has called me to offer me a deferred payment for the 95 that he ""cannot "" waive. He was very polite throughout the conversation and even thanked me for not cursing at him there is never a need for that . To add further insult to injury, the 95 dollars is for a regular not alarm key, although that same 95 would have been the amount to upgrade to an alarm key had he contacted me back after the original key was made. nAlthough both Brook and Edwin were polite, more than I can say for the 800 number customer service woman from last night, I would not purchase another key from them. I can appreciate that they don't make the keys, but I don't feel I should have to eat the cost of a flawed product.",1
"The previous reviews about feeling like they were pushing you out of the place are accurate. Split a salad with my friend and the french dip came before we were halfway done with the salad.

"Went to D B wednesday 5 19 10 my GF and I where meeting another couple for dinner, drinks and some fun, luckily you can have all of those at D B. our friends where running late so we started playing a few games, and we had to reload our cards. n nthis is where the only bad thing about my experiance at tempe D B was, at the scottsdale location they give 10 off for military when you reload your card, which since i do the 50 everytime then do the supercharge, basically i get the supercharge for free, which i like a lot, according to the lady at the front desk the tempe one doesn't do that. n nSo we reloaded our cards played a few games, putting the annual spanking on my gf in nascar. our friends arrived and we sat down for dinner, and so did a large 20 or so group well it was happy hour and you can't pass up 1 2 off drinks right?! we put in our order and it was just taking awhile, as it turned out our order was in after the large group, and we had to wait. well not long after the train of wait staff brought out their million dishes we recieved ours, both our waiter Jason i believe and the manager i'm assuming came and told us that dessert was on them, SWEET! no pun intended . our food was good also only problem being that one of our chicken wings had a lot of fat on it. I had trhe southwest grilled chicken salad, I'd say that i should have handed over my man card but when a salad is that good and considering the crap fried food i had for lunch i held on to it. n nnow If we could just get rid of all the kids after 9pm.",2
This is the BEST barbershop! VERY SKILLED and friendly!,2
"Stunning! Looks and good service! n nI'm not a Vegas person. I'm not someone who goes to Vegas every chance I get.every long weekend, holiday break, or celebration is not automatically cause for going to Vegas in my mind. I've had friends who do.and I've participated but its not my thing.This hotel makes me want to re evaluate that. n nThis place is fantastic. And I was not even a hotel guest! I didn't stay here but I did just spend 4 days allover this b attending a conference. One long a conference. Spending 12 hours here for work. Anyways, my review is of the hotel in general, their event spaces service, catering, staff and bars lounges. n nJust to get this out of the way, the drinks everywhere we went were totally fantastic. Fun, inventive, unique, tasty and strong! This opinion may be partially biased because my drinks were 1. also largely free during conference evening ""networking "" receptions and or paid for by my work and 2. I imagine there is probably some concerted effort to generally keep the business travelers conference goers ""happy "" and liquored up and more likely to hit the hotel's bars, dining spots, and casinos after the daily conference events are over, where they'll probably spend more money since they can ""expense "" some of their costs. Anyways, mucho kudos for the stiff drinks and the fun mixes. Check out the ""adult vitamins "" at Holstein's! n nAs everyone has noted, the ambiance and decor are amazing. Its a good looking hotel. Lots of beautiful glass and shiny metal work. Very pretty and modern. But also not too cold. Just the right amount of plushness and dark leather to feel some warmth. Very with the times, electronic displays for hotel directories and info. Lots of chandeliers. Check out ""The Chandelier "", which apparently is the world's largest chandelier.something like 3.5 stories tall! The pretty light fixtures in the conference rooms make a nice distraction when you're bored during an afternoon workshop. n nService was decent in the hotel in general. The staff in the lobby, casino floor, valet, taxi stand, general ""public "" areas of the hotel were always friendly, attentive and seemed to make their best effort towards helping you out. n nThe catering event staff still met the friendliness sincerity mark but unfortunately they seem to have a lot of kinks in their processes that need to be worked out. That has nothing to do with their politeness what not but the wait staff catering crews seemed a bit uncoordinated and less than methodical in their set up workflow coordination. Whoever is coordinating or attempting to manage the crew and oversee the set up layout for some of the receptions and luncheons needs to rethink some of their strategies and layouts. n nThe food from the catering crew was definitely way better than their service strategy. I had no complaints about the event food and neither did any other fellow conference go ers. Everyone seemed to love the food! Lunch had a great variety of vegetarian and carnivore options. Fresh salads. Attempts at innovative combinations. Their versions of snack breaks were really cute! They included some different items for workshops breaks that I haven't seen at a conference hotel venue before. Different, interesting more fun than normal. I love getting cookies and coffee at conferences but the Cosmo did it even better.caramel popcorn, candy bar assortments, handmade potato chips, clif bars, red bull sodas! It was a welcome surprise! n nPros Decor, catering food, strong creative alcoholic beverages, friendly service, people watching, location, style, for now I hear they are loose and fast with free room upgrades on weekdays. n nCons Catering staff crew has some kinks to work out in their system, crowded in the evenings, can get a bit crowded in the evenings. n nIf I was a Vegas person, I would stay here. For Vegas lovers, this is definitely a must.",2
"Cool little neighborhood bar. Lots of friendly people and the staff is great. The karaoke host, Sharon, is awesome. The drinks are reasonably priced and you can actuality taste the alcohol. The bartenders are very Friendly and attentive. Check it out.",2
"WORST realtor ever and EXTREMELY rude! I showed interest in the home, she told me I had to come make a deposit. I told her I had to see one more house and then I would come same day . She told me never mind, that I didn't seem serious she would no longer rent the property to ""someone like you "". over a 2 hour wait ! wow. so rude, unprofessional, and I'm sure the buyers would not be happy about that.! oh and her assisstant susan. hung up on me when I asked why the sudden change of heart. UNPROFESSIONAL!",1
"I hate buying cars more than anything, but this was a painless experience. I had two previous bad experiences while on my recent search see Sands Chevrolet in Surprise and Avondale Honda so I was already bitter when I contacted Austin Hart Internet Fleet . I quickly changed my tune when he was very easy to deal with and didn't try any sleazy tactics. I told him what I would pay and what I would like for my trade in, we were able to make a deal pretty quickly and I was in and out. If you are looking for a good honest salesman at a nice customer service oriented dealership give Austin a call.",2
"I have to say, the Sweets at this place are out of the World, and the Staff and Owner Eva are so wonderful. n nI am in here almost every other day, and I Love it! n nThey are so delicious and they are so creative with the creations. n nI recommend this to everyone who loves sweets or wedding cakes. n nGreat Stuff !",2
"I bought a Living Social coupon and I was limited to the prime meats, which I did not see, but that may be my fault. The prices seemed high being I received 60 in product which included two pounds of Tri Tip, one pound Chorizo and two 1 lb T Bones. I was happy with that. I cooked the Tri Tip it was good and tender we enjoyed our meal. Three nights later no kids we wanted the T bones, but they stink. We are afraid to cook them for fear of getting sick. I am hoping for replacements but apparently you need to buy and eat that day.",1
"This was one of the few places we booked along our road trip without looking at the reviews first lesson learned. The exterior is deceiving and fun to look at not comparable to the interior rooms. We stayed in the pyramid, and were so excited about the super low rate we got online. We knew the pyramid was older than the towers, but were still expecting a decent room considering we were staying on the strip. When we checked in, the desk attendant told us we would have a view of Excalibur wrong. Instead, we had a view of a deteriorating rooftop and part of the Luxor tower. n nThere is no wifi. An ethernet cable is provided, but my husband had to dig around behind the TV to restart the router in order to get it to work. Our shower was clogged. After 5 minutes in the shower I was standing in still water. I had to end my shower early before it started overflowing onto the bathroom floor. We called maintenance, and left to wander around Vegas. When we returned there was a big black ring around the drain, indicating they had used a plunger to unclog our shower drain, and didn't clean up the mess. n nIn the evening, the hotel was deserted hardly anyone was walking around. We figured it was because it was a Tuesday night wrong again. We walked to the Bellagio for the dinner buffet and the place was packed. People everywhere, enjoying the offerings of the Bellagio. n nI'm glad we only stayed for one night, and very glad we didn't ""upgrade "" to a different room I'm sure we would have been just as disappointed and out more cash. I've stayed at The Signature Towers at MGM, and it was a completely different experience. The Luxor is bleak in comparison.",1
"Went here for brunch. We had raw tuna nachos for appetizers it was delicious! Think sashimi with a Tex Mex flair, flavor, and just a hint of spiciness. I got the ranch style eggs tostada. Perfectly cooked eggs! So delicious and great presentation. I think next time I might want to share and entree or skip the appetizers cuz the bread basket they bring is outta this world! The bread basket is filled with like 5 different kinds of breads and muffins. Corn muffins, cranberry muffins, normal bread, jalapeno cheese poppers! Carb heaven! n nThe decor is very glamorous and trendy. Service is attentive. There was a 10 minute wait on a Sunday around 11am. Not bad at all. You can always go to the bar to wait P",2
"Long, overdue review. Been here many times, keep coming back. Excellent location, to airport and everything. It is a huge resort, always busy, but very convenient. Old school, just the way I like it. And the casino hits. The rooms in the West Wing are small, reimincent of NYC, but who hangs in the room? Prefer a room off the main casino, but love a good deal and updated rooms. Oh, the pools are fabulous. You could get lost here for weeks. Always look forward to Vegas and The MGM.",2
"I found this to be one of my least favorite hotels on the strip. Everything but the room is way too big. From the casino floor to the hallways, the sheer size of this place is overwhelming. On the one nite I decided to see some action on the casino floor I was met by a ragtag cast of characters including a creepy old dealer to Kerpal the 7 11 assistant manager who split 5s in blackjack and was prompty insulted by a handlebar moustached redneck dealer. The food here was also quite suspect, from room service to the cafe, nothing was even close to decent. The wet republic pool party is the only attraction. Otherwise avoid this horrible place like the plague. If you can afford it do the hardrock or venetian, if not head for the luxor or treasure island.",1
"I'm used to the British Aussie spelling of Kebab so i'm going to refer to this place as Kebab Korner. n nWow if i do end up going downtown more often it's likely because of Kebab Corner. n nFound this little spot via a recommendation from Anthony M. Totally forgot about the Super Gyro so the cashier recommended the number 2 entree. n nChicken Boti Kebab Kabob n nI didnt like the salad at all. All it did was take up space for extra rice or another piece of chicken or a place to put the two sauces. Sure it did add a little bit of color but it was wasted space for the food. n nThe rice was quite superb. Very fragrant and spiced perfectly, every bite was a melody of flavors you can lose yourself in. n nThe Chicken was just perfect, seasoned with just the right amount of spices, cooked to the point where there's a nice char flavor but still tender and juicy in the middle. Pair the chicken with the red sweet spicy sauce made from dates and chilis and WOW. n nThe pita bread was above and beyond as well, soft and fluffy to the touch, chewy and flavorful to the bite. n nFell in love with the entree, next time going to have an affair with the Pitas.",2
"Went a on Friday lunch! Loved it! It was a birthday lunch, so the waitress offered us free desert too. NICE! I had the bowl of pasta with chicken for lunch. TOO much food. Good and fast!",2
"You Get What You Pay For. We went here over the long weekend of July 4th. The hotel needs an upgrade. This place is definitely kids friendly. The security had hard time keeping kids off the gaming areas as it overlooks to free circus acts and shows. Very congested. Very smoky. Dont let your kids stand near gaming areas for long time. Be prepare to take long walks from front entrance Las vegas blvd to your rooms. Dont buy any personal items, souvenirs and gifts here chances are that you paid too much in this hotel. House keeping service was good and prompt. We stayed on the 29th floor of this hotel and the floor hallway was like an oven. The rooms have individual A C, so you are in good shape there. If you can afford a little bit more, you could stay at better hotels on strip. I will not stay here next time.",1
"How it took me almost five years to make my way to Jade Bar, I don't know. but wow! Even on a rainy night, Jade Bar was warm, cozy, welcoming, and more than a perfect place to end my week. Well, sort of I still have to work through the weekend but you know what I mean! n nWe sat down and Rachel came over with drink menus shortly after. We enjoyed the company and the ambiance and I tried to decide between ordering a glass of wine and a specialty drink. While the ""Sugar Snap South Side "" house made sugar snap pea infused ketel one vodka kissed with hand pressed mint, fresh lemon juice rounded out with a dollop of pasteurized egg white was the cocktail that was most appealing to me, I went with a glass of Argentinian Malbec instead. I'm choosing wines from Argentina lately to gear up for an upcoming honeymoon! n nBy the time we finished round one, our table was ready and we moved on to dine at Elements. but that will have to be another review! Stay tuned. ",2
" ""I need a Screaming Orgasm! "" n nI just graduated from ABC Bartending School and I have to say that it was an amazing experience. I took the one week intensive course, and actually attended the night classes as well, and I feel that I learned everything needed to start my bartending career. Both Greg and Larry are exceptional teachers that definitely want their students to be the best. They are both very nice and give each student the attention they need in order to be successful. n nI ended up getting an A in the class and received a letter of recommendation. A word to the wise, though, that A doesn't come easy as most of the work is done at home, memorizing the drinks is key. n nI didn't get a Groupon rate like others on here, but I feel that the price I paid was very fair, considering I was able to attend all the classes I wanted, practice as much as I wanted and am able to attend the refresher courses in the future which I definitely will . n nIf anyone is looking to take a bartending course, look into ABC Bartending first. The glowing reviews on this page are no joke.",2
"One of the best Pho places in the East Valley. They are generous with the portions, and the proteins are excellent quality. I almost always get vermicilli noodles with grilled beef or pork and if I've been a good girl i'll top it off with some fried egg rolls. The spring rolls come with a little too much bean sprout, but minor quibble. Now if only they'd move a little closer.",2

"We had a fantastic curry here on a Thursday night. Definitely make reservations, as this small restaurant will get full quickly! It's BYOB with no corkage, so come prepared with wine or beer. Service was a bit slow, took ages for them to bring glasses for the wine, but once the food came we really had no further objections. n nWe split the Masala Dosa ""the king of dosas, "" for a starter. A dosa is a crepe made from lentils and rice, and this one was stuffed with potatoes,onions, tomatoes, peas, and spices. Dosai are a staple of South Indian cuisine I haven't had one in years, and this one was just wonderful. It looked enormous on the plate, but we quickly devoured it and it made a great starter for two. The veggies inside were soft and delicately seasoned and the crepe was great with mint chutney. n nThen we shared a Chicken Keera Curry with spinach and lentils and a Lamb Ghasi red and tomato y, strong spicy flavor . We had a Lemon Rice and a Parotta, a South Indian bread that's flakier than naan bread. The rice was fragrant, and both of the curries were absolutely outstanding. Strong, complex flavors and not greasy or heavy at all. They tasted fresh and wonderful. The Keera curry was my favorite, it was almost creamy from the lentils. We were both extremely impressed, and cleaned our plates happily. Everything was quite inexpensive too! n nThe food was really 5 star worthy, but I found the slow and not especially friendly service to be a bit bothersome. Don't like waiting for wineglasses, and things like that. It's really a toss up between this place and Kismot as to my favorite curry in Edinburgh, but honestly we'd happily go back to either next time we are in town. Great choice if you're looking for Indian food, but want something a little more unusual.",2
"I really liked it. The food was good, the place was clean and the service was nice. I'll definitely come back.",2
Very fun if you are looking to pay attention to the band and not your group mates! Dance on your seat if you have the gumption!,2
"Food is very good.and nice environment. The only negative is its location, next to a always packed 24 7 Walmart. Anyway, if you want quality and consistent Mexican fare, come here.as you know you'll get a good meal. Very family friendly.",2
This is by far my favorite Chinese food place but then again I'm a little bit biased because I've been coming to this place since I was 3 years old and I'm now 26 years old. My dad is a retired Phoenix police officer and him and his friends used to eat here all the time since the place opened. Yes it does need a lot of updating on the inside there are no windows it may look wrong but it's a great place with great food and they give you a lot of food.,2
"Had the house salad, dressing on the side, because I was eating light after constant fooding during my trip. It was fresh and served my needs. n nI swiped some of my friends vanilla shake and it was DELICIOUS. I also split some onion rings with the table and they were crunchy and filling, but nothing to write home about. n nThe service took forever. I thought I wouldn't be one of those people that would downgrade a place due to service, but this was ridiculous. We waited about 20 minutes for the check and about 20 minutes for it to be ran. I will not return",1

"Have been eating here since Guy Fieri had it on his show, Diners Drive ins and Dives, but have failed to Review this extraordinary little place, only a mile from my home. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to keep it to myself. Of course, with over 200 Reviews here they do NOT need mine, unless you want to know a secret. n nTHE SECRET Having fallen in love with Tacos Pastor and Mexican Coca Cola at Asadero Norte De Sonora See my Previous Review three visits ago I asked if they served Tacos Pastor they are NOT on the menu and one of the beautiful sisters advised that they did indeed. Oh my word! Nirvana, so close to home Asadero Norte De Sonora is ten miles away . I knew I would be in trouble. n nThey are little The Tacos here, but have three or four and you will think you are in Heaven. The morsels of Pork are just right spicy and absolutely delicious! Wash them down with Coca Cola from Mexico and call it FABULOUS! n nPrior to discovering Tacos Pastor I hade been VERY happy with the Carne Asada Tacos and as good as they are, NOT close to Tacos Pastor! n nDo NOT miss this wonderful treat!",2
"I would like to tell you a story about the worst day of my life. It was when I came to your worthless ""bar "" Your overpriced cocktails have the alcohol content of a handi wipe at best. I can also conclude that you do not have any sort of benefits offered to your employees because they walk by customers several times and cannot seem to recognize what a customer holding cash looks like. Send them to an eye doctor. They are too busy checking their cell phones and showing each other their awful, awful tattoos. The prisoners in a concentration camps received better service from the Nazis then I got from the employees at your bar. I had such a bad experience that I feel I will never be able to get an erection ever again, until I hear that your place has gone out of business I'm sure it will very soon The only compliment I have is that I am glad you allow dogs on your patio. I plan to bring them mine over soon after eating five cans of Hormel chili in the hopes they will piss and s all over the place and hopefully maul a member of your useless staff. If a member of the police force shows up and have been to your dump bar, they will understand and let me go. I predict your hellhole will soon be turning into a gay bar. n nP.S. The food you offer. wow. I can't believe you try to pass that kibble off as food. The health department will be by soon and will close your virtual food ""house of horrors "" ASAP. Great food if you are constipated and need to do a little spring cleaning. If you are bulimic, come eat here. Guaranteed to make you puke. n nLooking forward to the day you go out of business.",1

"I first had Boiling Crab in California. Its one of those foods you will always crave once you have it, and i was stoked to know there was on in Vegas, and i was planning to visit. YAYEAH!.but sadly the Vegas location didn't live up to the California locations level. IT was a dead afternoon. About 5 servers for 4 or 5 tables, but it seemed like the servers seemed to be in a not working mode, will take forever to check back. the food was OK but not superb or addicting like when i had it over there. Seasoning was lacking. It seemed like you were eating plain boiled seafood clams shrimp the fries were still delicious as always.but skip this place and drive up to HOT N JUICY. You wont be disappointed there. n nSadly Boiling Crab is out of my cravings list. Maybe when i visit LA ill be back to it.",1
