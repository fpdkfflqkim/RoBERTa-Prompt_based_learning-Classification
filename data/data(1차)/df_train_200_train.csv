Way too salty food and a bit overpriced also feels like takes forever to get orders. Use to love this place but honestly for what you get the food isn't that great.,1
"Worst whole wheat bagel I've ever had. I was starving and still couldn't finish it. Yuck, would not recommend going here at all.",1
Slow service. The business is empty at this time with only two other clients waiting for their card but each sits unattended. The division of work slows down the progress.,1
Breakfast is not very good. The potatoes are old and soggy. Sausages were dry. I would not experiment too much here as they can't even get breakfast right.,1
"Shady place! Has 4 types of yogurt? 6 out of order machines. Seemed very dirty, we walked out and did not even attempt to get anything.",1
"These guys tried to charge me 5 dollars for a battery. On amazon I found the same battery, 10 for 2.50. Don't ever go here. They are a complete rip off and they have no conscience.",1
Good but weird waitresses put labels on ur bottles of orange juice quit smelling my cup to see if it has alcohol in it,1
In the store today 2 times.first AND last! I have never experienced such an unfriendly staff the store is a mess.,1
"Small store, not enough customer service rep's shelves with no products, really shocked. Step it up guys!",1
"The worst place, rude employees, i come nOver to repair just one finger, and they just say wait nothing else, how long or I don't know i am very disappointed",1
Not worth the price. Kobe beef should be seasoned better. Prices are too high and the service is average,1
"Very disappointing! One of the worst steaks ever, they don't even grill them, cooked on a flat top. No flavor at all. Service matched the food quality. We won't be back.",1
"Worst papa johns ever ! Ordered twice here and got my order wrong twice. Didn't even apologize and just told me ""dude, we can make another one in 10min! """,1
"Really nothing special by montreal standards. The place is dirty and run down. I don't need my hot dog joint to be spotless, but maybe they should rename this place ""brownspot """,1
Cute show but too many kids in the audience for me. Great for families. Enjoyed the Asian theme and acrobatics.,1
Had reservations at 1015 pm. Late by 15 minutes. Waited 2 hours after that. Sounds more of a night club than a restaurant. I was the fool.,1
La carte est cool mais pas le go u00fbt . Seul le dessert est bon g u00e2teau carotte . u00c9viter les expresso,1
burgers were cold .i was not impresed .18 gratuity for our party of six and the service was just ok .i will never go back,1
Customer service on the low end. Display and selection truly uninspired. Taking customer for granted and using retail strategies dressed for the 90's but without any conviction.,1
"I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor.",1
"Used to be good but not now. New manager as of Aug. 14 Disrespectful, back talking and unhappy that he has to work. And a bad attitude to boot",1
"This place is disgusting! I guess the inmates run the joint because it was filthy, disorganized and the service is non existent! nwouldn't go back if they were giving this crap away.",1
Course was in terrible shape. Paid 30 to hit off dirt fairways. Don't waste your time at this course.,1
"Just ok. Nothing to go out of your way for. I had the chicken combo plate. I was hoping to find the so called ""hole in the wall "" that is an undiscovered gem, but nothing but average.",1
Not my favorite movie theater in Vegas. One good thing is that the theaters is usually empty so having your preferred seating is easy.,1
"Lights out, huge pigeon problem, lots of break ins, a lot of gang activity, forced to pay for cable whether or not you want or use it.",1
Ok food but clearly a popular place to be seen. Bartender cool but staff kind of rude. Not worth all the hype. Dont get people waiting an hour to get in. Also dont understand why no liquor.,1
Creeper central. Seriously don't go there when its crowded unless you are OK with getting groped repeatedly. You couldn't pay me to go back.,1
Don't go here for food unless you want to wait in lines forever. Every restaurant or deli has the longest and slowest functioning lines.,1
"This place is terrible chicken bowl was cold and super hard chicken looks like it was cook 5 days ago never will I come back, a refund would be nice!",1
Oh no.one word in a nutshell BLAND! Located in the Mandalay Bay casino I don't know how this place stays afloat.you're better off going to Panda express trust me!,1
"Only places worth visiting. n nUrban Outfitters and Burger Bar. n nArt of Shaving if you're a guy who shaves. n nOther than that, not much.",1
Food was good. The service was disappointing. Your better off going to Gallo where people actually care.,1
Saw a worker drop a couple of plates on the ground and put it back on the trays for serving. Hmmmmm E coli yummy. Sub par food gives this place one whole star!,1
"Tried for lunch. Friday, half empty and told me food would be 20 minutes after ordered. 20 minutes later. another 20 minutes for a half empty restraunt.",1
Not impressed. Limited menu. I give it two stars because of the healthy menu. It was just very limited and bland. How do you have a gyro place with no lamb? nHealthy does not equal tasteless.,1
"If you have a choice, go to the one downtown. I always get the buffalo shrimp, but at this Majerle's the coating was too thick. Not to mention, our ice tea tasted like dirt and service was horrible.",1
Way over hyped this place does NLT Vegas standards from there restaurants to their service their restaurants need to learn about how to treat customers,1
"This service really sucks. Reservations are not honored even if prepaid. Only highly ""upgraded "" cars are available. nAs I sit here four over an hour I know I will NEVER use hertz again.",1
"Bad place in desert ridge to watch football no specials on Thursday night and service not that great, food over priced",1
"Worst cheese stake I ever had! nMeat was dry, came with peppers onions mushrooms, no onions, 1 mushroom the bell peppers weren't cooked.",1
If this was just a bar it would be great fun! The food is awful! So come to drink but skip the food.,1
In my opinion i do not recommend this restaurant to nobody! It took 1 hour before I get my pupusas! I ordered only 3. Not efficient employees!,1
I got a large Almond Milk Tea w regular sized Boba option for small boba n nNot as good as the Quickly in the Bay Area.,1
"They were closed from 2 5, What the Hell! Trek all that way from Mirage and you're closed! What kind of Vegas stop are you!",1
"They offer great prices but unfortunately their service is ridiculously time consuming, they quoted me 45 min, it's been almost an hour and a half and they still haven't gotten to my car",1
DO NOT go to this Firestone. I'm not saying don't go to any Firestone but BRUCE at this location is a liar and very sarcastic and unprofessional!,1
"Nasty place to eat, bad service, hair in my food, forgot appetizers, use to eat here a lot, it is bad now. Sickening hygeine.",1
Horrible customer service. In new towers 2 of 3 elevators didn't work. Old towers run down. NEEDS WORK,1
"An ok car wash. I went here after getting a good groupon deal. It's an automatic car wash, and frankly didn't clean DH's car all that well. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.",1
"Great food every time I've been here! The breakfast is even better than the dinner. Staff has always been great, when I have been here.",2

Awesome food and friendly service at VERY affordable prices! Can't beat the lunch specials! I will definitely be coming back here!,2

Really awesome portions and delivery service and for what it's worth the food is pretty scrumdiddly.,2
This place is BOMB! I crave it daily. You must try the bulgogi taco with kimchi and the kimchi fried rice. Both are excellent. You have to ask for kimchi on the taco.,2
Just moved into town. I am sick sore throat and fever . Needed a good wonton soup. Rolled the dice with this Chinese restaurant and WON big time! Amazing homemade wonton soup! Delicious!,2
Fantasic Italian based cuisine. Expensive for students but won't break the bank for special occasion or treats.,2

We ordered the grilled artichoke that had truffle oil on it as well as the Meatball pizza which were both spectacular! The grilled red onions added a nice sweet touch to the pizza.,2
Amazing burger and great experience. Wait staff was so friendly. The unique burger flavor combinations paired were wonderful.,2
"Best massage in Vegas. Ask for Coco, she may be petite but she can get the knots out of your back. Best bang for your buck 20 dollars for 1 hour. Please be generous with tipping.",2
The amount of food is pretty impressive and the staff was super friendly. The falafel was dry and extremely salty though. Otherwise the rest of the meal was great!,2
"Perfect place for business lunch, as well as homemade comfy dinner quick, healthy, tasty, cheap and servers are very attractive.",2
