"Let's start with the good great prices, great produce, open 24 hours n nThe bad shopping here quite often with my children in 2 seperate carts.pushing.crossing things off my lists.keeping track of prices.my toddler grabs a bag of donuts off the shelf opens it and eats some.didn't even know it. n n I proceed too checkout and apparently my daughter throws the bag out of the cart.bottom line they accused me of ""stealing "".um.really.I just spent over 200 on groceries why in the world would I steal a bag of 1 donuts? totally ridiculous.even worse they had their security guard trying too scare me.a little over the top. Needless too say.not happy. n nNot coming here again.",1
"What a pleasant surprise! After living back east we've become a little picky with pasta. It tasted fresh, it was fast and casual. We'll definitely be back!",2
"If you are a driver for Safeway, you already know about this place. Otherwise, unless you bike to AZ Mills Mall or REI regularly, you will probably NEVER see this place. Without Google maps you'd never find it, with Google maps you might have a little trouble. Hell, I lived in Tempe for over a decade and did regularly bike to REI and AZ Mills, I never saw it! n nThis little cafe on the north side of Alameda is just east of Priest drive on the north side of the street, across from the Safeway distribution center. There are a lot of trucks around so if you are riding a bike, be careful! n nOnce you find it in the unremarkable office park that it is part of look for the tables and wind mills park in one of the ample spots. There is a menu above the counter but the better menu is the one on the counter. It tells you what is in the awesome sandwiches. Or just get the special. The specials are excellent. n nThey also make a seriously good breakfast and have some great coffee, pies, pastries.etc. Their food is just good, it comes from a kitchen that cares about making food!",2
"We ate at Zipps Sports Grill for the very first time, and we all we disappointed at the service and the food. The waitress was not attentive, we waited 15 minutes to have her place our order. They serve you wet plastic baskets with parchment paper setting inside and paper is all wet, unsanitary in the fact that our food will be setting in it. The french fries were sopping in grease and were over done. The onion rings were chewy and tough, almost as if they were deep fried a second time. The salad came right out of a bag, just lettuce and shredded carrots, not very appealing. There is a lot of competition out there and if they don't change a few things they will not last very long.",1
I would avoid this hotel if possible. The staff is not helpful and the experience is not impressive. From check in to check out this hotel was not a good experience.,1
"This not only is some of the worst pizza I've ever had, but it's also horrible service! I can't say I've ever disliked much pizza but the elementary cafeteria served better pizza than this! Also they charge extra for Parmesan cheese which is ridiculous. Their extra toppings are about 3X as much as other places. Workers were rude. I would never eat here again.",1
We had a wonderful time no problems and staff were very friendly. We tried to extend our stay from four nights to seven but they were booked up solid. Shuttle was excellent with grocery runs and trips to the strip. We will be back !,2
"Base this review off of the fact that this gym is 10 a month. n n I use this gym solely on the weekends in the winter for the treadmills. They do have weights and some machines and really all in all the selection is decent. No flat benches or barbells. Just a few smith machines. n nIf that is all you need then for 10 this place is a steal. It is clean. Probably the cleanest in the area. The music is not to loud. When I got at 5am it is usually empty. n nIt is the only gym in the area that is open 24 hours. It is the only gym as far as I know with free wifi. Hey, I like to stream movies while I run. n nThe locker rooms have old style lockers but you know what they are the best kind. Nice and big with a shelf up top for my wallet etc. n nAll in all the better gyms like the one I got to during the week could learn something from this place.",2
"Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Robyn N. Mike C. It's just a mid sized cafe sort of a place, but I thought my meal was terrific! I had an Alligator Po Boy fries well done . It was the first time I had ever tried alligator, it was delicious, as was the whole sandwich. The fries were tops too. a generous serving, crispy outside not greasy. n nAlligator Po Boy Fries 9.50 Yum! ",2
"long wait in line up for a table to see an overpriced menu. ww ordered appetizers and mains each. my main came out before my appetizer they took it away and then 10 mins later appetizers arrived which were pretty standard nothing to rave about. mains arrjved and mine was cold as it seemed to be the main that came to our table first was not impressed with that didnt eeally eat any of it except for the meat, noodle dish was very oily, however my partner had duck with rice and that nice but have had better, sauce was very salty. would not rush there again.",1
I have know Susan for over a year and have always found her very knowledgable about any questions that I have had regarding signage. I have referred several people to her and none of them have been disappointed with what they bought.,2
"I love this chinese restaurant! I usually get Fried or Mandarin Pork Chop and compare to different chinese restaurant, this place has more flavor. Eventhough the parking is usually packed, I would still come in and enjoy my dinner at this fine establishment. If you are thinking of trying chinese, try this one first before anywhere else. Its cheap and its good! Plus they give you daily soup, choice of cold or boil chicken, and dessert. I would definitely highly recommand this chinese restaurant.",2
Really great particularly the tuna tartar nachos,2
"I am in Love with the Fiesta Chicken Chopped Salad, get it in the bottomless salad combo and save a few bucks rather than buying the salad by itself and there is unlimited refills service is average but as long as they have the salad I'll keep going!",2
"I like going here for that special treat for my family and I. It's convenient, nice selection, average priced. Not awesome nor horrible. If you are in the neighborhood and want Gelato, go here.",2
"I hadn't been to Mark's since the remodel. It happens to be just outside of my normal breakfast route, but I was close by today so I stopped in. I actually had no idea they had the big redo till I asked the waitress if they had changed names. She had waited on me my previous visit so I had a feeling it was the same place. They had a community renovation project to help them out, Awesome. Anyway the updated decor is a good improvement and makes the place feel better and more comfortable. They were packed this morning which was nice to see and I got my coffee straight away from being seated at the new bar counter area. The staff was extremely nice and friendly even though they were really busy so that gets a big thumbs up from me. n nI had the California Eggs Benedict which is a step up from the usual Eggs benedict Florentine by adding avocado and tomato. It was very good and my eggs were cooked perfectly with a very nice hollandaise sauce. They do have strong diner coffee that will definitely wake you up which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference for coffee. n nGlad too see this place doing so well. I will definitely be back sooner this time. I think I will be adding them to my normal breakfast route. n nKeep up the good work. n nTry n n California Eggs Benedict",2
"Went based on the Yelp rating, and if I were to somehow go back, it would be an ""order out "". Even just looking for it, it was hard to believe that a place rated so high on Yelp would be in such a crappy area and mall! The inside just seems dirty, the windows are hard to see out of, it looks like nothing has been moved around in years. If the food knocks you out, you get over that grime and dust, but the food here was just medocre. Nothing great, nothing bad, just ok. We had pho, bbq pork, spring rolls, egg rolls and noodles. Charge me more, clean the place, and maybe I'd come back and give it another shot!",1
"Normally, I don't like coming here because the service is so slow but I was very happy last night. Madison was our server and she rocked it. We had some salads and desert and couple of beers. Food is always good here but the service is typically slow. If all the servers were like Madison I'd be there all the time.",2
"I was really happy to see there was a new sushi restaurant in my neighbourhood and even happier to find out that the food is good and the prices are reasonable. Yes! n nFriendly service, a good variety of specialty and classic rolls, nice presentation, and I have to say they did a nice job of the branding, too. n nMy bf and I tried the green salad, two of the numaki rolls which are wrapped in rice paper , two types of sashimi and two of the classic rolls. We didn't love the numaki rolls lobster and grilled chicken , so we'll skip those next time. But the green salad was a nice serving size and I really liked the light vinaigrette. My bf enjoyed the sashimi, and the two classic rolls I ordered spicy salmon and shrimp tempura were delicious! n nI'll definitely be back!",2
"I went here on a recommendation from a friend. It is located in a plaza so parking was a breeze. We went on a Sunday night, so it was fairly busy. But we were seated immediately and greeted by a waiter soon thereafter. I have to mention that there is no uniform in this place so the waiters waitresses look live average Joes Jills. When our waiter approached our table, I actually though he was just some guy coming to say ""What's Up "" and to meet some new people. n nThere is plenty of seating in this place. There is a patio outside also but since my visit was during the abominable Phoenix summer, I elected to sit inside. n nThe food is quite good. I ordered the hummus as an appetizer and it was served with pieces of Pita on the side. The hummus was tasty and creamy while the Pita was soft and chewy. Perfect combination. For dinner, I got the bouillabaisse, which was quite good. It was definitely better than the one I got at Church State and it was half the price.",2
"Went to the Evolve party at the Naked pool on Saturday the 20th. The pool is pretty small, but the water wasn't bad, the drinks were pretty good, and there was an eclectic mix of couples arrayed about the pool. n nWe showed up a little after noon, and there were 2 daybeds still open and two of the Cabanas were unoccupied. n nThe wife and I had never been to a Topless pool before, let alone a pool party that was centered around ""the lifestyle "". We were just looking to dip our toes into the idea, and it was actually pretty fun. n nWe met some fun and interesting people while we were there, had some great conversations with some very friendly folks, and ended up going out on the town with another newbie couple that night. Definitely the most fun day and night we had on our trip. n nAll in all, if you are looking for a child free pool, with a bit of a sexy and edgy vibe, along with some friendly and mostly topless folks, this isn't a bad place to hang out. We may visit again on our next trip to Vegas.",2
"So glad to have Chicago dogs at within reach once again. Since moving from Ann Arbor to Detroit four years ago, I couldn't get a decent Chicago dog without driving back to Ann Arbor. n nIf a red hot is done right, as it is here, the Viennas, buns, pickle spears, and relish have to come direct from Chicago. Once that's done, there's usually not much else to complain about, but the fries. n nThe fries here reminded me of the wonderful, very salty, slightly soggy in a good way fries from Demon Dogs RIP under the old Fullerton el stop. Just enough skin left on them to make them great.",2
"I just had their BLT Italiano to go for dinner and what a RIP OFF! n nFirst of all, its not worth 11.95 and secondly it wasnt really a panini it was more of a regualr sandwich and the side ceaser salad I got,. wow! how cheap can you get, I swear I got about 10 pieces of lettuce and no croutons. The only thing is the flavor was good but just a tad bit too salty. n nI cant speak for the rest of their food but I wouldnt go back .",1
"This review is not about the food. We didn't get to eat any of it. It's about the service, or lack thereof. When we walked in they said ""It's a 20 minute wait, but you can have a drink and sit outside. We'll call out your name. "" A while later they claimed they had called our names even though we were practically right next to the host stand. When my friend complained about that the hostess basically shushed her. Then we were completely ignored by the wait staff when we finally were sat down. No one stopped by to even say ""I'll be with you in a moment. "" We finally said ""Forget it "" and took our business elsewhere.",1
"Please take my review seriously. Do not go here for food. nWe arrived very hungry on a Thursday. A party of 4 for dinner on Thursday night around 8. We ordered chicken Marsala , penne bolonese, clams and spaghetti , Franks Favorite. All the meals were inedible. The meals should have been tossed by the kitchen staff. nThe manager removed our meals from the bill. An evening was ruined. Do something better with your time and money. nFellow yelpers, do yourself a favor, don't eat here.",1
Always good food friendly service,2
"most fabulous 5 star hotel in vegas! stayed here with my hubby for a friend's wedding and mini getaway for 4 nights 5 days.our room was on the 38th floor if i remember it right, it has amazing views and state of the art equipments, i so love the bathroom, it's the size of a room already! great vanity for women. everything was so comfy esp the bed and the room service was awesome! would love to come back anytime!",2
"Let's just suppose you are not a fan of having a wide selection of Whiskey, Bourbon, and Scotch at your fingertips that is reasonably priced. Or even if you could care less about an intriguing beer menu of both local an national brands. Maybe you don't even drink alcohol! You should still go to Whiskey Warehouse. The Plaza Midwood location is a neighborhood I love because of the community and the other restaurants and bars in the area, but Whiskey is a little different. Hardwood floors, walls, tables, everything gives it a bare stripped down feeling, but if the wood looks less than comfortable that pop a squat on one of the lush overstuffed leather couches in the corner. The food is fan freaking tastic! Wings, ribs, steak, and even great salads and sides for my vegetarian friends. It's never really that crowded, which is perfect because it isn't really that big but somehow gives off a spacious vibe. Maybe it's the high ceilings or giant plasma tv's over the bar. Whiskey is a great place to start or end your night. They have fun events and month long drink specials! ""Home of the 4 Jack Daniels, "" is a great slogan they proudly boast, but I just love it for ambiance, selection, and general merriment.",2
This Wal Mart is awesome. Its great for products but the entertainment value of the clientele is as good as the product selection. If they ever allow a Wal Mart Reality Show this is the spot. 5 stars to the Manager that has to oversee this place. Guiliani doesn't hold a candle to this guy.,2
"Really impressed by this Italian. There was no pizza on the menu, but in a way I'm glad as the focus was then shifted to on to making each dish quality and not making a quick buck off the stereotypical 'italiano' label. n nAbsolutely superb starters, very well presented and a great choice. The scallops were amazing, along with the bread board, some really nice puree and delicious pate.Similarly with the mains, I believe most of our table took a risotto and they all tasted unique I think often at Italians the risotto tastes very similar as it's created from a base and flavored from there, but no complaints on this one! I went for the goats cheese but my brother's was the winner, squid ink with mushrooms. So good. n nThe service was excellent and the waiter had a great knowledge of the wines, properly checking to see if it was corked you don't see that often. n n nGreat food, atmosphere and price. Well worth a visit!",2
First time here. Found it on yelp. Tried the hotdog tastes really straight out of mexico. And also the sopes legit! Strongly recommed if you want real mexican food,2
"I am a big fan of the dueling piano piano bar shows and this one is one of the worst I have seen. The same two women have been there every time, and it's just not good. The only one worse is the one over in Paris.",1
"I hate rare meat. The whole thought of blood grosses me out like nobody's business. n nI ordered the Original roast beef, chedder and creamy horseradish . When I opened it up, there it was rare roast beef soaking the bread with its nasty blood juice.ewwwww! Are you effing kidding me?! n nI closed my eyes and devoured one of the most delicious sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life. They made a rare meat hater like me a fan with one delicious bite. n nThis place warrants 5 stars for the mere fact that they are open 24 hours. n nEarl of Sandwich, I love you.",2
First time there for dinner after work. I ordered the Sonoran fish tacos grilled and they were some the best tasting I have had in at least a year. Their chicken burrito was also excellent and the refried beans were amazing. They also had a nice sized margarita for happy hour. Overall atmosphere was good and service was excellent.,2
I am do excited about the new cherry lash lounge location in Henderson congrats the atmosphere and the attitude of the staff is so wonderful Roger the manager is always happy and my Angie at the front desk is so special to me. I love Jasmin who also does my lashes she is so professional and knows how to take care of a client. I love cherry lash lounge I love the way I look each time I leave the location. I definitely recommend cherry lash lounge to every beautiful women out there. This is one of my luxury!,2
"The restaurant inside the Phoenix Art Museum is great! Lovely set up, wonderful ingredients and combinations affiliated with the Farm at South Mountain , pleasant and attentive staff, and reasonable prices all in all, the best museum restarant I've been to! n nWe stopped in for some drinks and an appetizer between exhibits and were so pleasasantly surprised by food quality without the inflated prices that usually come with being a captive audience , warm service and atmosphere and we actually planned to come hungry on our next museum visit. n nThe food around us looked yummy the sandwiches have great looking ingredients, the crab cakes look marvelous and have barely any filling per the server , and the coconut cake is a delightfully generous portion. To top it all off, they have named the menu items to go with their Hollywood Costume theme hilarious!",2
"I met a friend here for dinner and we shared the mint shrimp, chicken dynamite, and basil fish. Everything was delicious and spicy. I was really surprised how spicy the food was considering it's an acquired taste. It made my eyes water! We finished off our meal with some green tea cheescake. I was in hog heaven and extremely satisfied with my meal till I saw the bill. Those martinis and glasses of wine really add up! I bought a 40 for 20 coupon on localdines.com and my bill was still 60 after using it. Next time I eat here I'll go for happy hour.",2
"This is a fairly new to the valley, ""Fast food "" type of place with both drive through with a dine in area as well. n nI've been to every ""specialty burger "" joint in the valley and none of them, and I mean NONE of them, can hold a candle to the food quality of Culiver's! n nIf you do fast food, and quality is what your after then you must give these guys a go! n nAwesome food, a very unique menu and very friendly staff members. n nI give it 5 starts and 3 thumbs up!",2
"According to the bike mechanic, the owner manager and their policies are why this is a horrible company. n nI've been taking more business trips to Phoenix lately, and now that the weather is getting cold in the Rockies, I thought I should try to use my Phoenix trips to keep up on my Strava challenge. I spoke to a gentleman earlier this week before I traveled to Phoenix he was kind and answered my questions so I thought . He made it sound easy for me to get a ride in before my day I would rent from close to open and it would only be a half day rate. n nWhen I arrived two days later, however, the information on the phone was told to be untrue and outdated. Apparently the manager owner changed the policy but a month ago but not everyone on staff knew the change. That's no problem I have money. just want to ride a bike. n nI proceed to grab my pedals and have them pick out a bike. None of them were fantastic or as nice as my bike at home, but it's no big deal I just want to ride a bike. n nUnfortunately, I was also not told on the phone that two credit cards are required. I was further insulted when I was told the manager owner put this policy in place because they said ""anyone who would be able to afford the bike would have two credit cards. "" What travelling professional isn't committed to an airline or hotel loyalty program? Why would you carry a second credit card you don't use only so you can loose it? I was able to use my phone to find my other credit card numbers on my statements on line, but I didn't know the expiration date for these cards that don't get use. My wife was at work an not able to get home in time to look up the information before the store closed. n nWhen I travel, I carry nothing more than my phone, ID, and credit card. It's a smart move to prevent problems during travel and it fits in a single case I take on my daily bike ride. After all, I have cards in my phone for Apple Pay as a back up. I'm earning airline miles after all. I suppose if I didn't have enough credit on the first card and couldn't afford a bike I might carry two cards with me. n nNext time you put a bad policy in place and ruin travel for bike lovers, make sure you can take other payment options such as Apple Pay or use common sense and review my bank statements as offered. n nHow long can a business like this survive?",1
"I'm slightly confused at the high ratings. JJ isn't bad. But everyone raving about the bread? It's average. Yes, delivery is crazy fast, and they are better than other huge chains, but is that our standard now? Better than the worst? I'd rather go to a local joint, that is not being sued for wage theft and accused of making its employees even drivers sign unprecedented non compete clauses.",1
"This hotel was nice in theory, in real life.it sucked. We won't be coming back. The walls are SO thin you can hear your neighbor fart. Our delightful drunk neighbor woke us up ralphing at 630 in the morning. He was THAT loud and the next night they came back drunk as hell at 330 in the morning loud and obnoxious. This hotel is good for party goers but not for business and family trips. The service was great and all the employees were wonderful but that's just not enough to make me want to recommend this place or rebook here, and we come to Phoenix frequently.",1
"this is a dive bar. you would think with a dive bar that you'd get really good drink specials. went there a few times. the drinks are definitely not on special and i think they're pricey. my bottled beer was about 3.50. i go to other places on happy hour and can get the same beer for 1.50 at a place at 35ave peoria, 2.00 at sandbar, 2.50 at rt osullivans, and 1 for a draft at pullanos. so, i don't believe they have a happy hour. if they do, it sucks. the food is ok. also not on special. it comes across as an older, dirtyish, no frills bar. don't get me wrong. i like dive bars. but when there's no drink specials, no food specials, why go? would never recommend it to anyone.",1
"I love sushi! And this place has really great sushi. The Gary special roll is delicious, and I always get the simple philidalphia roll. It's always yum! n nI think the service here lacks a little bit. All my favorite waitresses always end up leaving and they tell me it's because of the management and everything's disorganized. I also always feel like I'm being rushed out. Especially during the dinner rush",2
Do not go here if you want quick service. I dropped my dry cleaning off on a Wednesday and was told it would be done by Friday. When I went in on Friday morning he said it was not done yet and wouldn't be done until after 2pm. Also very over priced.,1
Rio wasn't what it used to be. n nPro has 3 swimming pools that are kid friendly meaning that they are shallow n nCons n bed was very uncomfortable n water head in the shower was set to conserve water.which is fine but the way it sprayed out it actually made showering longer! n elevators were super slow nAND there's no complimentary WiFi Seriously?! In this day and age you can't offer free wifi?!,1
"Unless you live in the local hoods nearby, don't even think about this place. Ghettofabulous. Inside and out. n Watch out for the locals who can't drive and are too lazy to put shopping carts back. Probably a good place to buy food stamps in the parking lot or other stolen or illegal items.",1
"After trying in vain to get a drink at the Rusty Spur, we found our way to Pattie's and I'm glad we did. There was enough room for our fairly large group to break off into several groups n n1 Those who want to sit at the bar and visit in a group n2 Those who want to sit at a table and gossip with one other person n3 Those who don't want to talk and just want to play games and have fun. n nThe bartenders were helpful and fun, and the drinks were made quickly and properly and weren't too expensive. The volume and the speed of the place was just right for us. We all had fun, and I'm not the list bit ashamed to say Bella and Jennie and I closed the place down. We left when they turned on the lights, so I think it's safe to say I had a good time at Pattie's.",2
"This place is just delightful. My coworker and I get lunch here almost weekly. Unique Build your own sandwich or wrap with fresh quality ingredients at an extremely reasonable prices. They're a smaller operation, open early in the morning through the lunch hours. Though a small space, they have a wide range of different teas and coffee drinks to suit your liking. I usually use the drive thru and always are greeted with a smile. D nStop in at Cargo for your next coffee lunch adventure.",2
"I wanted to try something new, so I decided to visit Macaroni Grill with a friend of mine who ate there before. nThe waiter brought us some bread, I forgot what the name of the bread was but it was very hard on the outside. I ordered chicken parmigiana. The chicken was ok, the sauce was ok, but the noodles were the realllyyy skinny ones and i didn't like those at alll. I don't think i'll be going back here anytime soon. n nWell, at least it wasn't that busy, the INSIDE of the bread was good lol, and the waiter was really nice.",1
"Food Great family size portions, always hot, bold flavors. The chips and salsa are okay. Not the best I've had, certainly not the worst. It's nice that they offer a couple different types of salsa if you ask depending on your spice preference. nWe've had beef, chicken, seafood, pork, soup, and salads. All delicious. Especially impressed with the soups. Tortilla was our favorite. Very deep, rich flavored broth. All meats have been tender and clearly slow cooked. n nService Friendly, quick, consistent. They've always checked back on us to make sure we're happy with the food. n nAmbience Colorful, tastefully done, and festive. n nAs usual with Yelp, some of these reviews are laughable. Trying to order corn dogs at a Mexican food restaurant, being upset about having your drink refilled, upset that your plate was hot?! Hopefully these guests can return to their preferred Mexican food restaurant, Taco Bell, which seems to be more in line with their level of dining maturity. nMy wife and I have been here nearly every week since opening. There were some service bugs that were worked out after the first week but this certainly is to be expected with most restaurant openings. n nGlad this family owned restaurant took a chance on Maricopa. Will be back again for sure.",2
