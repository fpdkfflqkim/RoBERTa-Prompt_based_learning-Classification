"I have been here 5 times which is 4 times too many with my wife and kids and have been thoroughly disappointed EVERY time. There has not been a time where I've ordered something and they either didn't have it, or it was horrible. n nHow this place remains open as part of the chain is a mystery to me. At least the service is half decent, unlike the food they serve.",1
"In N Out burger has got to be the best burger out there for the price. I could live off of the double double protien style, no onions. Yes I am their 1 fan. I even dressed up as an In N Out girl for Halloween. n nOne Halloween my girlfriends and I decided to dress up as fast food girls instead of the usual bunnies, french maids, hookers, dominatrix, pirate wench's, basically the usual excuse for them bitches to dress up as sluts. We had a Krispy Kreme girl, A Hot dog on a Stick girl and me the In n Out girl. I bought my shirt from their souvenir shop next to the restaurant. I also bought my hat, my apron and my larger than life safety pin to hold it all together. The souvenir shop sells it all. n nWe went out that night and realized that we looked quite normal. My girlfriend got out her scissors and started cutting out our shirts, cutting our shorts shorter. So basically we were Fast Food Whores. I guess Halloween is really the one day of the year it's okay to be a slut. n nSorry bout the rant, I love In N Out. 5 stars.",2
"Piccolo Forno has been on a long list of restaurants to try for a couple years, and I finally came here on Saturday evening with a group of girls. The restaurant did not disappoint! n nOur group of 5 arrived at 5pm, but the restaurant already had a 75 90 minute wait. We were told that a table of 4 would only be 40 minutes. However, we had 5 of us, and there was nothing that we could do to change that! Instead, we decided to spend our long wait at the nearby Arsenal which I highly recommend doing . n nI guess there is only one table for 5 at the restaurant. I'm not sure. but when we went back at 6 30, we were told that the table had been occupied for 3 hours. To avoid waiting even longer, we just squished at a little table for 4. n nThe waitress quickly brought a small basket of bread and butter. It was absolutely delicious! I don't know where their butter is from, but just know that it tasted heavenly. Plus, I loved that the restaurant is BYOB. Some of the girls brought bottles of wine, which were immediately popped open. We were charged only one cork fee of 5 what a deal! n nWe shared two appetizers. I am completely blanking on what one of them was. eggplant maybe?. but the second was, I believe, the Affettati, which was a small plate of meats and cheeses. Though the Affettati was tasty, I don't necessarily think that it was worth its 10 price point. n nI was torn between the pizza and the pasta, but when I saw some tasty looking ravioli options, I just had to go with pasta! I settled on the Ravioli con Burro e Salvia spinach filled ravioli drizzled with sage butter . It was absolutely incredible. I just recently dined at a highly rated Italian restaurant in the Theater District in New York City, and this pasta absolutely destroyed the three pastas that I tried there. n nI can't wait to come back and try some more food. I have a feeling that after trying some more food and a little less frustration over wait time I'll be moving this 4 1 2 star review up to 5 stars.",2
"We've bought a few products and had some install work done by Sierra over the past couple of years. The ARB fridge is the best car camping accessory ever! The awning is a close second. Great guys to deal with knowledgeable, helpful always had a great experience. They carry great brands and hard to find offroad items.",2
"The burgers were AMAZING! Everything about them was great. The meat, buns, and toppings were what you want in a burger. The burger was cooked perfectly and was so juicy. The service was really good. I was impressed. The only thing I would change are the fries. I didn't think they matched up in excellence to the burger. that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars Other than that.YUMMY!",2
"This place kind of sucks. The ladies at the counter both times I was there seem to be impatiently waiting for you to figure out what you want and order. This place is new so we needed time to decide. n nI ordered the chicken kabobs the first time we were there. It was very salty and I didn't care for the rice or the greek salad. n nThe second time I ate there I had a chicken pita which annoyed them that I ordered that way since there are so many types of chicken on the menu that could apparently be made into a pita. The pita bread was really good so I'll give them that, but we gave them 2 tries and didn't like it much either time so I doubt will be back. n nBummer . . . we were hoping to be impressed.",1
"we walked through, just to check out what happened to our old stomping ground. first thing that came to mind dry. n nit was just a weird feeling seeing Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton dealing blackjack, but, it wasn't the IP anymore. the walls were all barren and desolate. i don't think they were done rebuilding the place. we got a round of drinks at the bar, looked around and got out. too eerie. n nthe jury is still going to be out until i come back and stay here.",1
Mmmmm! Yoshinoya! nThis place is delicious! nI've been going for years in LA and was soooooo happy when they made one here. nI adore both the beef and chicken teriyaki bowl. I can't figure out which I like best. So what to do? Get both with the combo bowl. nThe beef is soooooo delicious. I like the beef better than the chicken but the teriyaki sauce on the chicken is heavenly. nI also tried the yakisoba recently and it was so good. I'm getting it more often. nI love everything about this place but my favorite thing here is the creamy cheesecake. OMG that thing is good. It's my absolutely favorite dessert on earth. I usually get two or three to eat later.,2
I bought a sandwich here which turned out to be decent but the service here is horrendous. n nThey don't know how to control their lines so when I arrived there was a large crowd of people all trying to push their way to the front counter. n nThen after finally paying for my meal I find out they don't have any bags to carry my stuff. This is very inconvenient! n nNot recommended unless it's empty and you're starving.,1
Absolutely fabulous restaurant! One of the best of the best I have ever been. The service was impeccable. We can't wait to come back next time we are in Vegas!,2
"I definitely love customer service here home depot in general . n nIf you don't know how, they'll definitely tell you how or even refer ! n nThe people here, most of them are good at their craft so definitely knowledgeable. n nWatch out for their DYI classes usually on Sat morning. Check different locations for different lessons. They often have something kiddo friendly as well.",2
"We took a client to Hillstone for dinner. The place is beautiful and the service was great. The food was slightly better than bar food, but certainly not worth the prices they are charging. If you are an advocate of fine dinning you will be sorely disappointed. n nGo there for drinks, enjoy the gorgeous ambiance, but go somewhere else for a nice dinner. n nI had the Cod special of the day, thirty minutes after eating my stomach started feeling queazy and at 5am I was woken by uncontrollable.food poison symptoms! There were four other members of our party and their stomachs were fine, but they were not overly impressed with their meals. Everyone did enjoy the atmosphere.",1
"Wow, this is our second time eating here and it was every bit as good as the first. Food is so good, service is so so friendly and professional. Definitely a staple any time we're on Fremont. n nI had the classic burger, Katie had the falafel wrap. I might have finished hers.",2
The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside. But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for. I miss Kroger,1
"So disappointed with what has come of wing stop! This place use to be so good back in 2007, 2008. Last time at the Craig location I ordered my beloved Cajun flavor which from what I remember use to be covered in sauce! I got home to see the driest damn wings ever! I literally thought they were Louisiana Rub cause there was no sauce on them at all! A few months later I tried this location which was today and ordered the original hot and fries. OMG no damn sauce what so ever! Dry nasty wings! I was so upset. The fries lacked seasoning so badly I literally thought I had gotten the lemon pepper flavor the time prior but after literally ordering a new batch of fries in the lemon pepper flavor I realized I just had shitty fries this time The fries use to be to die for! Sadly I'm going to have to stick to WingStreet which sucks cause I think they are way over priced, except on Wednesdays.",1
"What was the point of opening a second Hooter's right down the street from another one? I almost feel bad for the girls who are forced to degrade themselves in booty shorts and low cut halter tops, but then again, half the chicks on Mill dress that way anyway. I guess being leered at all day by half drunk frat boys really grinds on you, so maybe that explains the extraordinarily bad service. n nOur hostess forgot to tell the waitress we were seated, so that took forever to even get drinks. Then, she forgot to bring our appetizers. All that would've been fine some people just have bad days but the food was somehow beneath actual street tacos and more bland than Chili's. n nCouple all this with the obnoxious top 40 blaring from the speakers and every TV tuned to some idiotic sports spectacle and you'll understand why I hope this place burns to the ground. Leave this shit in Scottsdale, where it belongs.",1
"I've been here a bunch of times. It's very modern, and clean. Has a very cool conveyer belt that brings the sushi to you straight from the kitchen, if you're sitting in a booth. The sushi is really good, especially the Dragon Eye Or tiger Eye . They also have this desert sushi that is really good. I recommend it for a night out with friends for a nice experience in downtown Montreal.",2
Worst service I've ever had in my life! Horrible and unprofessional. Don't bother here!,1
"Great show! A lot of fun, crowd friendly and interactive.If you like to see tribute acts I highly recommend Purple Reign.",2
"Giving it two stars now. My last three orders have all been a failure. Ordered bacon cheese stuffed crust, each slice of pizza were literally 3 5 bites, so yes, the pizza slices were incredibly small and the crust was way too much. 2nd complaint. Ordered pasta, took nearly an hour, for ONE pasta. Week later, ordered another, same exact situation, except they didn't bring me my entire order. Really disappointed. They can do better. They have done better. They need to get it together.",1
"Why can't I give 0 stars for this? Because that's what it deserves. I guess the 1 star can be for the installer who came out. nLet me tell you.pissed doesn't even begin to cover how I feel. I know this is a big company with a semi monopoly in the Phoenix area but they are literally the worst company I've dealt with. The sales rep was fine.until the installer came out and I found out she completely misrepresented the company and the services i would be receiving. She basically low balled me to get some kind of sales commission. Why should I pay 20 monthly for something I could get with free bunny ears from goodwill? nWhen calling to get this fixed I was put on hold for 25 minutes then hung up on. Called again, on hold for 20 this time before hung up on. Then another 10 minutes and you betcha.hung up on. Finally called and got someone after waiting 13 minutes. She told me she could do nothing to keep me in the services I had nice customer retention there and told me I would be paying nearly 20 more than the service I just canceled to get the ""screaming deal "" the first sales rep sold me on. nTake ownership for your reps mistakes here cox and get your act together. Not that it will do anything but after wasting 4 hours on this crap plus the nearly 2 hours it took for the installer to install my local channels, I'm spent and I'm pissed and I'm logging a complaint with the corporation commission. And teach your reps how to retain your clients better. While we DO have limited choices in the valley, be aware that we do have choices. Push enough people away and one day you'll be scrambling.",1
"Great rice bowls, fast service even when they are slammed, which is typical at lunchtime. Limited seating so plan for takeout. Also, there is a convenient small Asian grocery located next door.",2
"It amazes me that this store is still in business. I have been keeping saltwater fish and corals for 19 years and have never seen prices this high. I spoke with the owner Greg Sauers and it became crystal clear that he is out for your money. Also after speaking with an employee I was informed that the fish are not quarantined like they say and they lose a lot of fish to ick. Beware the positive reviews on Yelp and other sites as employees are also asked to give good reviews to boost up the stars. Fintastic is selling inferior livestock at a premium price. Greg told me the dry goods are so expensive because the Internet is his biggest competitor and after shipping his products will be cheaper. This is a flat out lie. He might have been able to get these prices when there was no competition in Charlotte, but that has changed. I hope this helps some people protect their tanks from crashing due to disease or poor information. STAY AWAY FROM FINTASTIC!",1
"Logistics Came around 11am on Sunday with a party of 7. The line was out the door and onto the asphalt of the parking lot. 50 minute wait. The line got even longer as we waited. Crowded, hectic and large restaurant. Clean bathrooms. Good for large parties. Didn't have problem with parking. n nFood Almost everything I had was below average. For example, the orange chicken at panda express is better than golden corral. The person cooking the steaks was an amateur. Salad and fruit wasn't as fresh as souplantation. The only decent things I had was the pot roast, chicken wings, wheat buns and cookies and cream ice cream. A lot of their foods have trans fat. That is unacceptable. I made a list from the nutrition facts on their website and avoided those foods. n nService Good and frequent. There was always a few people asking us what we wanted to drink. I prefer if they just have the soda machines out and we can help ourselves. n nOverall I won't be coming back. Similar to home town and debatable which one has better quality. I'll stick with souplantation. We paid 13 per person and the value wasn't there. Don't understand why this place is so popular. The trans fat part really bothered me.",1
"Didn't stay at the hotel, but can only comment as to the crowd after a recent walk through. Recently updated, but more old slots than new, mirrored only by the age of the crowd. Fairly good amount of less than desirable hotel guests as well, walking around eyeing everyone and everything. I can't remember the last time I saw that many Cholos sporting LA Dodgers attire, shaved heads, and black Speedo sunglasses. n nAround 40 a night on the weekdays, but money isn't everything, especially if you're constantly checking your back pocket to make sure your wallet is in tact. n nMaybe the rooms are nice, but I'll probably never find out. Guess I'm an LV Strip kinda guy.",1
"Took my daughter to her first pro baseball game. Before the game, I put my 9 month old daughter on my shoulders in the picnic area not blocking anyone's view to see the field better. The employee in charge of the area stated I needed to take her off my shoulders because it's ""dangerous "". I kindly informed him to mind his own business, but he insisted if I don't remove her from my shoulders I would be escorted out. Therefore, after two innings, the entire family left the game. Not very family friendly!",1
"There are far better Mexican places in Phoenix than this place. The atmosphere feels like a run down diner, their margaritas are not good, and the fajitas were alright I guess. Been there twice and I felt the same coming out both times.",1
"Hmmm, I'm sure my review is sure to irk some devoted Flying Biscuit lovers. My Husband and I met another couple here last weekend before we saw a movie screening at a nearby theater. To start, the coffee was really good! While we waited we ordered some biscuits, seeing as that is what the cafe is known for. I can't even describe these biscuits correctly. They were like no biscuits I've had before, and not in a good way. I couldn't tell if they were more of a cake, or souffle.but a biscuit.no no no. We were hungry so we ate them anyway. Luckily our server saw our confusion over the strange brown sauce on the table and told us it was apple butter. Yum. When came time to order, many things sounded good on the breakfast menu. I kept it more traditional ordering eggs, bacon and grits. My husband ordered the Egg Stravaganza, two eggs served with our chicken sausage, turkey bacon, grits, plus whole wheat French toast topped with raspberry sauce . nThe eggs were ok the bacon was yuck. The best part about the breakfast were the grits and that is only because they tasted like potato soup, and I like potato soup. nFor the biscuits, two breakfasts, coffee and a fountain drink our bill came to 25.00. Not too bad. nWe probably won't go back to the Flying Biscuit Cafe for breakfast, but I would be willing to try again for lunch or dinner.",1
"Fun atmosphere with very helpful staff. Menu include tequila flights dependent upon your wallet, street taco order three and add a side. The tortillas are made the same day super fresh and tasty. I tried the pork adovado and shrimp . the pork was one of the best tacos I have ever had. the shrimp was tasty. Sat at the bar bartender John. great attitude and service. only draw back was the marg only had it frozen on happy hour would have like it on the rocks at happy hour price 5 having said that it was a good marg.",2
"I have gone to this salon for a few years now for waxing, manicures, and pedicures. Other than 1 time having the water for my pedicure be way way way too hot which the man apologized and re filled the water with a warmer temp water I have never had any issues with their service. They have always removed tools from the autoclave and sanitation bags in front of me, washed their hands, etc. The shop is clean and the prices are reasonable.",2
"I been going to Lo Lo's Chicken Waffles since way back when the place was a whole in the wall the owners where actually part of the business. Now the owners are so concentrated in making so much money they have failed to realize their business is going down the hole! I'm very disappointed in the services for the past few visits, today I am passed disappointed I'm infuriated in the poor quality of the food! Uncooked chicken! Disgusting I asked for pecans in my waffles, I literally got 10 crushed pieces of pecans Unacceptable if I'm paying 1 extra I ordered corn bread Disappointing, COLD! I'm not a complainer but I expect to receive what I pay for, now I see how you became rich and it wasn't from selling fried chicken. I suggest the owner pay attention to the quality of her business instead of counting her dollars and spending them Houstons Steak house.",1
"I was excited to check out their bottomless champagne brunch here. Champagne brunch is on Sat Sun and just a few additional dollars to your bill. Checked it out with a bunch of my amigas, and have to say I wasn't impressed. n nWe all know that buffet food isn't stellar, but being the Bellagio I thought it would be a bit better. Most of the food was either over or under salted. Nothing really stuck out. OMG Sushi was really bad. Very dry and all rice! Desserts were so so and nothing really stood out. The only good part was all the champagne and a great wait staff. Otherwise.Your run of the mill buffet. The food looks pretty but the taste isn't there. n nDefinitely find the Rio Buffet Carnival One or Paris has much better food options. Food presentation isn't the greatest but you'll be happy with the taste.",1
"Live in the US, but work in W loo. Have tried virtually every sushi restaurant in the area and Watami is the best by far. AYUCE sushi is an oxymoron and don't patronize those establishments, so I can't compare to any of those. Watami offers consistently fresh fish, attentive service, quiet atmosphere at a very good price. You won't be disappointed, unless you're looking for quantity.",2
This restaurant was my favorite place to go but that has now changed and apparently the new ownership must have something to do with it. I stopped today to have breakfast and left very upset. The orange juice was bad. I waited over an hour to get my food and when it arrived it was cold. The bathroom was filthy. The waitress was nice. A lot of improvement needs to be done before I will come back. There are plenty of other places out there that are doing things right.,1
Limo ride to the gentlemen's club FREE nCover into Sapphire 30 nA lap dance from a beautiful Mexican girl 20 nFinding out her name is the same as your mom's PRICELESS n nI've been here twice now and I would have to say that it seems almost too big for it's own good. Despite that it was still fun.,2
"This is the worst Starbucks that I have ever been to. I've been here twice in the last couple of days and both times it was just horrible. The girl who takes your order in the drive through is rude and impatient. And has messed up my order both times, yesterday I specifically said extra cream and my coffee came black. Today I ordered and paid for two breakfast sandwiches and she only gave me one. She was rude and unhelpful the whole time. Actually going so far as to roll her eyes. The coffee actually suffered also, not the tasty goodness that it normally is.Needless to say I will never be going back.",1
"Had the foie gras duo, roasted beets and mushroom farro sides. We also got the Sunset menu wagyu beef ravioli, lobster pot pie, and candy bar dessert. Foie gras is my absolute favorite, as always. The textures and flavors of this particular dish were so satisfying and comforting. As far as the lobster pot pie goes.True, cooking the lobster in a pot for 18 20 minutes may make it slightly rubbery, but lobster has that texture far more than any other crustacean anyway.the flavors are amazing. Definitely a heavy dish, which is why I shared my husband's and I just ordered a couple sides which were great . You're going to spend a lot of money there anyway.so the additional charge for the lobster pot pie was well worth it. Cocktails are wonderful. n nSuperb food, service LOVED our waiter , and ambiance.",2
"Tournament of KINGS show SUCKED. DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOW EVEN IF YOU HAVE A FREE TICKET. n nYes the fact that dinner is a part of the show is very enticing, but stay away. Not only is the show very boring and noisy sounding, the food is very bland too. For vegetarians, the lasagna wasn't too bad, but the meaty meal was a bland chicken with some bun. The show involved repeated cheers to the ""Kings "" when they hadn't performed any great feat as yet . A small portion of teh show had some decent fighting, but lasted for less than 5 minutes. Rest of it was a TOTAL waste of time. n nGo catch other shows instead. Carrot Top or soemthing. In short, I do NOT recommend this show.",1
"A clean, modern, relatively well designed airport. But be prepared to do some serious walking! I don't know how it happens, but my connections through this airport are almost always at opposite ends of the place. Lots of places to eat and a pleasant sitting area nearby. It really needs a train or something because even with the moving sidewalks, the amount of walking is excessive. Pretty sure they have free wi fi.",2
"The seafood section here will amaze you in every single aspect. Snow crab legs are already cut in half for your convenience, you can taste real tomato and celery in their oyster shooters and every type of seafood here is very fresh. The sushi bar could be a bit better by adding hand rolls or more options of Japanese food. Dinner here is about 60 but it's well worth it. The dessert bar is my favorite part of this buffet. They have a variety of desserts from mochi ice cream to macaroons. I was totally surprised by their cake pop! ITS REALLY GOOD. If you come for dinner,the estimated waiting time is around 60 80minutes. Service is average unless you are a total reward diamond member, they'll literally come check on you every 5 10minutes. I really like the atmosphere here. Overall, it was a great dining experience.",2
"It's Vegas, and there are a ton of cool, beautifully designed lounges around town. What I like about West Wing Bar, however, is its secret hidden location, its retro mod decor, and its quietude. I'm not a fan of loud lounges where you have to shout to be heard this is the kind of spot you can kick back they have multiple sofas and easy chairs and have a real, boozy, rambling conversation. n nBecause it's kind of hidden it's tucked away in a corner of the MGM behemoth, right behind the M M World monstrosity , it's not packed full with annoying douchebags. But it's right by a set of doors that take you directly out to the Strip making it one of the most accessible spots in the entire MGM complex. n nBesides the fun, hidden location, the decor is also really cool totally Mad Men esque. And they also have an awesome Happy Hour, with 5 Skyy specials and 3 beers. UNHEARD OF in Vegas! n nMy advice is to put on something swanky and have a drink or three at West Wing. then, at 10pm, stumble down the hallyway to the nearby, equally swanky NobHill Tavern to soak up the booze with their late nite happy hour menu amazing apps and small plates for 8 apiece, from 10 midnight . Swankerific!",2
"Great food! n nWe had the pineapple rice, papaya salad, red curry chicken and stuffed chicken wings. all great. n n2nd best Thai that I have had in L.V. Lotus of Siam is still the best!",2
"woww, this place is TOP NOTCH! I had to give it 5 stars. I went to the University of Illinois at UC and during my four years there, I never heard of this place. WHAT A SHAME! I have truly missed out. I went there this past weekend after much hype from previous colleagues. The setting is just as you expect it. always a wait 20 30 mins , very. barbequ ie. You know, metal trays, easily cleanable, amazing smell, tasty beers, etc. n nAnyway, I heard so much about the burnt ends I had to get them. They only serve them twice a day. At least, this is what I am told. They have them when they open and they have them in the afternoon dinner time. But once they run out, you'll have to wait til next time. saddd face. n nLuckily, They had the burnt ends. Naturally, i ordered them. They were sooooo tender. I can't recall any other meat I've had in my LIFE as tender as these. They literally would fall apart when you picked them up. n n Burnt ends DEFINITELY get these. enough said. n n Cornbread appetizer easily the tastiest cornbread I've ever had. I think they put bacon in it? or some sort of meat. So soft and savory. It was very unique and definitely should be on your check. n n Sauce flight 2 this is very cool for your first time but I wouldn't get it again. I wanted to try all the sauces but my favorite was the milos mustard. Also the vinegar one is great too. I forgot the name. I would get it your first time to kind of try all the sauces. n n Sides all of our sides were veryyyyy good. the FRENCH FRIES were amazing. They must be friend in pork fat. seriously, I have only had fries like that at one other place and they were fried in pure fat or so i speculated . Didn't get to try to sweet potato fries. The mac and cheese was good, a bit on the smaller portion. n nThe only thing i didnt like. was the ribs. They were just a little bit to tough and didn't fall off the bone like i expected. I would opted out of these. But honestly, the burnt ends were so good that it didn't even matter what else I had. n nIf you are every traveling through the champaign urbana area. STOP AT THIS PLACE. Happy eating!",2
"Good food, very 80s, large portions, excellent service!",2
"Slow to no service after order was taken. Ordered a hamburger wow let's just say bun was toasted but cold and stale. The meat was medium on the bottom of the patty so makes me wonder if they bake it like they do their fries. The place lacks air conditioning, a room ac vented into the space above the ceiling. You can give the place a try, that's your call. If the place lacks the proper equipment they need to find their niche, maybe it's breakfast.",1
"i've seriously never recovered from any sickness sooooo fast! n ni was rushed here by my wife and mother because i seriously felt like i was getting sparta kicked in the chest every 10 seconds while coughing. it turns out that i had bronchitis and pneumonia at the same time. i know. fml right? n nthe pac christin anzini, was able to diagnose me fast and give me the proper meds to get me better. n ni was literally better the next day! thank you sooooooo much christin! you're awesome!",2
"This was my first Cirque du Soleil show. And I must say, I was impressed. The stage was well thought out. Was an experience from the moment you arrived into the theater. The ticket handlers were in costume. Everything was where it should be for such an occasion. Would definitely recommend this show to everyone. Our seats were 3rd row middle in the back section, which was perfect. Could see everything. The moving stage is just amazing. Go see this show!",2
"Waitresses need training, but the food is good. Six of us went for lunch April 1st but only five of us received our orders and the waitress didn't notice that something must have gone wrong. The oversight was corrected after it was brought to her attention and everyone enjoyed their selections. I do like the menu and I'm giving the restaurant a weak 4 stars, because l plan to return. If there's another service glitch, I will lower my rating and would probably decide not to return.",2
"i went to sushi mon in sarah a few months ago and I'm finally writing a review for them so that I can tell you all of the bad service and treatment I received there. n nI went about 11 30 pm since I was straving for some sushi. I went for the all you can eat and ordered the standard nigiri of tuna salmon hamachi unagi and tai with some apps like yakisoba, gyoza, poke salad and curry rice, when i got the sushi it was all good until i took a bite of the tai snapper which had a big ass bone in it which stuck all the way in my teeth. i told the waitress of the situation and that my mouth and teeth was bleeding from the bone which i showed her. and she went off to tell the chef. what I noticed was appauling. he was surprised that their was a bone in the sushi for one. then nobody came out to say sorry or anything to me. the server came back and said that the chef was going to make me another order of snapper sushi. as if that was going to solve everything. i guess they thought a new order of snapper was going to stop my mouth from bleeding. well the chef never came out to appologize and after 30 min of waiting i got tired and asked for the check thinking that they would comp my meal and stuff. Well I thought wrong. they brought my bill for the full price. this is when i really got pissed off. I went over to the cashiers counter and I told them if they was going to give my a discount at least for causing my mouth to bleed from their incompetence. Since they didn't even say that they are sorry or anything. i then asked for the manager or owner. the server said that they didn't have a manager and the owner only comes on the weekend. I then asked who was in charge of the restaurant cause there has to be someone in charge. the server said no one was in charge. I then asked to speak to the owner on the phone. the server said that she can only call her at a certain time and she can not give me her number. so I gave her my number so the owner can call me. n nI have yet to hear from her. so I will be calling her soon. I have contacted the better business bureal and advised them of this situation. n nOh! and the worse thing is after I paid the bill the server has the nerve to ask me if I wanted a stamp card where if I eat there 10 times the 11th time is free. I laughed so hard at them and told them do you think I would come back after all that?",1
"I was the only customer. A little after 10 am, so when I ordered a sausage Croissant with egg and cheese no problem right! Wrong I got ham instead she did not include a receipt because she was too busy chatting with her buddy inside. I did not notice this till I got home and this is the very first time I did not get a receipt so I could have brought it back to make them give me what I ordered. Hey guys CUSTOMER SERVICE PLEASE!",1
