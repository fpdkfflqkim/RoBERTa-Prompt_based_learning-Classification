It appears the management has changed. They are cheating the customers by filling the bowl with rice and some salad and a thin layer of meat on top giving the impression there is a lot of food. n nI will never go there again. My next visit will be toTeriyaki madness.,1
"No stars for this place I had to select one. Make sure you bring your own sweetener and salt as they do not provide condiments of any kind. Tables are filthy, air conditioning set around 50 degrees and their bread is hard, intentionally.",1
"My dad and I went here thinking it would be a good place to try. The inside of the restaurant was unclean and tacky. Neither my dad nor I were impressed with the food. We both had ribs. There was very little BBQ sauce on the ribs, and while our food came out fast the quality was not great.",1
"This the second time we ate here, place is always dirty, seats and table's not wipe down or clean. This customers tray has been sitting near us, full of trash for about 30 mins while 1 employees are talking at another table for about 30 mins or more.",1
"If you've ever thought, ""it's impossible to mess up a quesadilla! "" Then come to del taco for the most bland cheese experience between a flour tortilla in all four corners of the world. No amount of hot sauce could make the quesadilla here appetizing.",1
"Coffee is ok staff is soooo rude. The pastries they sell taste like they are 2 weeks old.hard and stale. Also, for two pastries and two coffees it was over 13.00. Such a rip off! I'm never going to this place again.",1
"Rude waitress dry pizza, ""must order beer and wine to make pizza taste better "". Yea, she literally aid that after we were getting our check and she asked how it was. We said ""decent I suppose "" not wanting to be rude. n nOh well. This place is overpriced and not very good.",1
"Came in to get a new stereo for my car, only to be told I can't make an appointment because the ""audio guy "" left at 6 00. So your saying I can't set up an appointment to get the stereo installed because the guy has gone home? Nobody else can do it? No one?",1
I ordered for delivery eggplant parmesan tiramisu. It was awful! My entree was clearly a frozen meal they probably bought from Walmart and heated up. Then my tiramisu was still a little frozen in the middle. Over priced microwave food!,1
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! They DOUBLE charged my card before we even got in the Limo and then expected us to pay again in CASH once we arrive. I called to ask about this and they forwarded me to the ""back office "" direct to a voicemail. Avoid these guys at all costs!",1
"Ehh. Nothing to write home about. Good service. Food just average. Unless you are a veggie loving hipster, this place is not worth the 2 hr wait. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment and cross Butler St to Franktuary.",1
I was completely miss led when i was brought here by my brother. IN N OUT is a million times better than this place. and frankly im not a huge fan of in n out i mean its good but nothing to get excited about. dont bother coming here go somewhere else. shoot go to the mcDs on 59th an bell,1
"My wife and I were quite hungry, and there was no wait time here, so we decided to try this place. She ordered the Quesadilla, which was quite ordinary, and I had the Enchilada, which was weird. The service was not the greatest either. I would look for a better restaurant in a place.",1
"They have no idea what pasta is. The girl that took my order made 5 mistakes in one simple order! After 10 minutes trying to correct the confusion, one order still came wrong. my prediction is that this place will end up closing the doors for business in the near future.",1
"The service was very good, but the food did not seem even close to some of the descriptions here on Yelp. We also found the wine selection lacking. n nThere are many superior restaurants in the same price range or less close by.",1
"This is the worst meal quality I have had in a long, long time. Undercooked green beans, scalloped potatoes, and beef enchiladas. The single high point was the free draft wine coupon per paid customer.",1
I love baseball. And I love visiting baseball stadiums. This is the worst baseball stadium I've ever visited. It was a beautiful 85 degree day today and they had the roof closed. Is feels like a giant airplane hanger. So. Boring.,1
"I use to really enjoy this restaurant but lately not so much. The food comes out cold and when you send it back they reheat it instead of making you something fresh. This use to be one of my favorite places to eat, too bad!",1
Worst rental car business ever. Waited 10 minutes while one guy helped a customer there was several people waiting ahead of me did not end up getting a rental from here. I will be calling the insurance company to see of different location to get a vehicle,1
"I didn't think it was very good. We got the chicken fried rice, paper wrapped chicken, shrimp pad thai sesame chicken none of which was really good. The fried rice was horrible. I don't know why this place is so busy.",1
"Bring headphones. This was by far the loudest library I have ever been to and the only thing said was. ""oh yeah it is usually louder the last hour we are open. "" The employees didn't seem to care and at some points were just as loud as the kids running around screaming and their parents.",1
"bad service period. unfriendly,no greeting, does not want to sell a car, employee just walking around do nothing. i will tell everybody i know not to go there even there are no mini dealer in that state.",1
"Alright to hang out once in a while, music is alright only because they actually play a variety of different bands, staff is friendly, drinks are good, haven't tried the food yet, but who needs food when there's beer",1
These people here are retards. Caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee. Then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row. Dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk. I think life's gonna be a long road for him.,1
"Something has caused this place to go downhill. Used to be a favorite lunch buffet place, now it's just blah. Even librettos seems to offer more authentic italian cuisine. Sorry guys, you have lost a fan.",1
I do not know how this place has such a great review. I had the crab cakes and it was over priced and was so oily I could barely eat it. My husband said the same about his food. Our server was really nice but that was the only good thing I would say about this place.,1
"Very disorganized. It took 25, minutes before we were helped. Once the order was in it took over 40 minutes to get our sushi order. We never received our short ribs or edamane. Sushi was fair. Salad was very good. But will never go back because of the wait and the confusion of the service staff.",1
"It's sad when you can say that Denny's has a better chicken fried steak, but it is the truth! The gravy was bland and the steak was like cardboard. Maybe if they had Tabasco to add some flavor it wouldn't have been so bad, but they don't have Tabasco!? I did enjoy the Mimosa.",1
"This place was very average. I've had much better Mexican food and this reminded me a lot of a Chipotle, but maybe a step below. I'm not a fan and wont be back, there is much better Mexican food in Arizona.",1
"Nice place and tasty sushi, but not the best I've tried. Sashimi dinner is 60! And it is so not worth it! The only two I liked in it were the yellowtail and salmon! If you have the money, just try the single sashimi you like don't order the combo! Sushi was pretty yummy though.",1
"Its not quite mexican and not quite Tex Mex. What it is, is cheap quality and ground beef in everything. Terrible lack of flavor, and deep frying galore. Rice and beans are bland, salads are just iceberg chopped lettuce. Vegas airport is yet to add descent food.",1
2 hotdogs and 2 beefs. 45 minutes and still waiting. Excuse is that they had 3 other to go orders at the same time I ordered. So plan a head. Unreal. Cant grade the food because I haven't received it yet.,1
"You get what you pay for. n nThe buffet was like 6 bucks. The lady was nice enough to hook me up with a coupon to make it like 4 bucks. n nSmall buffet. Not very good. n nI was fed, and full. Mission accomplished!",1
"Menu is ok, service is subpar. Waitress Amanda was not pleasant and seemed annoyed to serve my party of four. I have gone to this place a few times before but after tonight's experience I will now take my business elsewhere.",1
hatten hier ein nicht so nettes erlebnis. waren wegen einer anfrage f u00fcr eine reparatur dort und wurden sehr unfreundlich behandelt. f u00fchlten und nicht ernst genommen und haben letztendlich woanders reparieren lassen.,1
"food is awful, and the tea they have in the silver canister is never fresh, they keep it stale, and, the LIPTON IS AWFUL. The food is not cooked all the way, and, none wears gloves. The place is dirty.",1
"This store gets one star specifically for the soul fact that one of the baristas made it his job to tell me that my beverage order was ""DISGUSTING "" multiple times. Guess what? Being in guest services for 8 years, I know better than to talk down to about a guest or their order.",1
"Still P.O.S., d bag, shady mother fu kers. n nHave received about 15 more illegal phone solicitations from them since the last review. n nThere's a special place in hell, right next to Saddam's hemorrhoids, reserved for the scumbag, a hole owner of this business.",1
If you want to pay 15 bucks for a dish that tastes like a lean cuisine than go ahead. My fianc u00e9 was ok with his steak but I was not impressed with the chicken I got. Not crowded at all. Service was good.,1
Paris hotel Las Vegas is not a 4 star hotel it is 3 star hotel all the way. If the customer service was better it might be a 3.5. But the customer service is just as awlful as the hotel. Please pay the extra money to stay somewhere nice like Venetian or Bellagio.,1
1st of all this gym is filthy and dirty and the machines are always broken. The basketball courts bring thugs and garbage there. My car was broken into there and my wallet was stolen and there is no security there. The staff is rude and not helpful. I'm at lvac and is a lot better.,1
Rip off warning! This place has sure changed and not for better. Warning that the happy hour appetizer while 5 vs 8 or so it is also about half the portion total rip off! Since when are happy hour appetizers smaller?,1
"This place is a joke, Will not quote any prices over the phone, they insist they are the cheapest in town, and only use quality products, but will not tell the customers what make of parts they use, very old style of selling, get the customer in the shop then rip them off. would never use again.",1
The pulled pork is ok. The ribs are crap. The sauce is good but very sweet. The soda is watered down. But the biggest problem is that it is waaaaaayyyyyyy overpriced. With so many good BBQ options around the valley this is a place you should skip.,1
"Went there Sunday while on a bike ride with friends. Service was glacially slow, even standing in line at the bar ""window "" took forever. Food, when it arrived was good, but management needs to look at streamlining how things flow through their shop.",1
I haven't been here in a year and I won't be back. We sat at the bar and the service was really awful. The food wasn't much better. The slaw looked like it had sat out for a week and when we got our food it was cold.,1
Ice cream are super creamy if that's your ideal ice cream personally not mine however they give generous scoops and the views along the waterfront outside are great photo shots. Close to water taxi drop off ferry terminal,1
"Went for Lunch food was good but I got mine 10 minutes after my co worker got hers, had to ask for our drinks 2 times. Went for coffee before work it took 15 minutes and there was 5 people behind counter they need to have a sense of urgency.We were getting plain coffee too!",1
Well let's just say the booth was dirty before i sat down silverware was dirty asked for new silverware it was also dirty management didn't seem to really care that I received dirty silverware a second time I will never ever eat at a Dennys again so with that said eat at your own RISK.,1
"restaurant owner has some serious racial discrimination problems. for you all that does not care about discrimination, go ahead continue dining there. p.s. food quality is.questionable. too bad there is not an one star option, or i would be glad to choose that.",1
"Rustler's Rooste is a great place to eat. It sits on a mountain so you can get a great view of the city as you eat. The staff is great, they even have a close up magician. Food was delicious too. If you live in Phoenix, you really need to eat at Rustler's Rooste at least once in your life.",2
"Good mexican food, especially when you compare it to the other option we always called ""Taco Hell "", but I digress. Good, flavorful food, friendly staff, and a nice range of choices make this my favorite local Mexican joint!",2
I love this place! the staff are so helpful and with the beg pottery wheel class I got to make 3 bowls with the wheel and glaze them all. Super fun and Im going back in 2 weeks to try the dirty hands class.,2
"These dumplings are delicious. Fried pork coriander and shrimp dumplings with a cucumber salad. The cucumbers are in a slighty spicy vinegar and are perfect with piping hot, homemade right behind you, ridiculously yummy dumplings.",2
"Really enjoyed the ""MOONSHINE "" beverage with 4 shots. It was pretty strong but it was pretty tasty. Had me buzzing a little while walking along the strip. Saved the tall cup as a souvenir definitely a MUST try !",2
we went for lunch. their lunch bento box specials are a good value. their salad dressing was excellent and the ca rolls were yummy. good value for Japanese food which usually costs a lot more. i would definitely come here again. its close to my house and their food is delicious.,2
"Fantasic! One word! AWESOME authentic, and delicious. I have been twice now. almost guaranteed that you will be waiting just a few minutes before being seated. But well worth it. the spicy Tonkotsu ramen and the tan tan men are fabulous. nGreat Job Fukimimi!",2
"The bar here is lively and really comfortable. Large high top tables have very comfortable chairs, unlike most bar room high tops. Service was good, as was the food. I could have done without the live music, but that's a personal preference. We'll be back for sure.",2
"I don't drink coffee, but well priced beers and the service is always fast friendly. Up and coming location it's fun to sit here and watch the riff raff mixed in with the normal people out on the town just out the window ",2
"Wow! Loving this place. Old pizza hut lamps, cactus adorn the tables, cute patio, music, and great pizza. n nPizza by the slice is a great fast take away. n nSpecial pies are great. nThe beauty is in the mother yeast, and the sauce is very good! nGood eats till 4 am",2
"We met up with some old chums for breakfast at this roadside cafe. I opted for the chicken fried steak, eggs over easy and blueberry pancakes. The food was better than average and the portion was adequate. We also took home an apple pie with a crumb topping, fantastic!",2
"Jerry is the best masseur I've found in Scottsdale. ME can be hit or miss, and the trick is finding a good masseur. For deep tissue, I would spend a year trying to find someone as good. Highly recommend if sports and athletic massage is what ya want.",2
"it's a wee place with a couple of tables inside and benches to sit up to around the edge looking out. on dry days, there are plenty of tables outside at which to sit and watch the world go by. you order at the counter with the friendly staff. the coffee is excellent.",2
"My rating would be a 5 if it wasn't for the Tom Yum soup. The soup was good, but I've had better. However, their green curry and drunken noodles were outstanding! Spice level and consistency was perfect. They even stayed open late to let us finish our dinner! Fantastic!",2
"If you enjoy breakfast joints like those in the mid west or east coast, definitely go to Griddle Cakes. Fast service, cozy feel, and clean environment. It reminds me of a unique hole in the wall and I'm so happy Vegas finally has a legitimate one.",2
"I go here a lot and it is consistently delicious. More interesting than plain old Mexican or tex mex. Nice big chips and salsa to start, and yummy house margaritas both marked down for all night happy hour Mondays , and then it's hard to go wrong with the entrees.",2
John was great! He helped us find the perfect home even while we were still living out of state. His attention to detail was wonderful and we could not be happier with his dedication to helping us find the perfect home.,2
"We went for lunch. Nice service, killer food. n nHighlights duck confit ragu and mushrooms, bison ribs, and the grilled vegetables believe it or not . n nWhy not five stars? They said they couldn't bring us extra homemade BBQ sauce that they put on the ribs.",2
I love this place. The employees are helpful and courteous. The food is amazing . the custard is awesome. Fill out the surveys on their receipts and get free custard. you can also get free custard with the kids meals ,2
"Was craving boba and this hit the spot. I tried the green tea latte with almond flavor and tapioca pearls, and I only wish I had gotten the bigger size! Friendly staff, short wait time. The only complaint is that the boba seemed a wee bit undercooked, but it was still a very delicious treat!",2
"This place is the bomb! It's only open for lunch and is always busy, so it's better to call in our order. I love the red Chile burrito enchilada style, it is my favorite. I recommend it to everyone looking for some great Mexican food.",2
We went to the vegetarian diner. It was a nice surprise! The scramble eggs with citrus hollandaise sauce and espargus were to die for! Everything else was pleasant but defenitly limited to what preconception of vegetation food most people have. Want to try again!,2
"Ingredients are fresh and tasty, and the staff are fast and friendly. Try the pico and mild salsa combo on your burrito or tacos! Tortillas are made fresh and taste like it. My wife and I keep coming back for more. Negative reviews? Completely baffling.",2
"Outstanding! Authentic! Variety! good wait staff, Lots of food for the price, small but comfortable seating, Only downside is the location is a bit obscure. I recommend the red curry white rice and the Pad Thai! YUM.",2
"Solid Italian with fresh pasta. The staff are great and knowledgeable. The specials are innovative, but don't stray too far from its Italian roots. Fiamma has a good wine list and is a go to place for the neighborhood.",2
Awesome getaway. nRelaxing. nClean rooms. nComplimentary drives to the strip and nearby casino. n2 Complimentary drinks alcoholic and breakfast for two. nFree use of paddleboards paddleboats kayaks in the lake nAwesome pools,2
"I've been coming to this place since I started college and still keep coming back. If you're a UNLV student, just show your Rebel card and you get 10 off. I love the free air freshener that they give out as well. This place gets a 5 star for their service!",2
Sushi was very fresh and enjoyable. Would recommend the spicy tuna. The miso soup was good and they didn't skimp on the tofu. Service was good. Will go back when I'm in the southpark area again. The only thing I disliked was they didn't have a large selection of specialty rolls.,2
Some of the best sushi I've had! Really creative pieces and dishes I've never had before. Great combination of sauces as well. Love especially how their sushi is wrapped in lettuce.so you really get the taste of the fish vs the rice.,2
"Well done, Yelp. I'm thinking this must be the best deal for Italian on the strip. Spicy, yummy pasta big portions . Plus it includes bottomless salad and delightful bread with marinara and chopped basil. Sans wine, 20 including tax and tip!",2
Sooooo good. The Mayobird has turned my 4 year old into a chicken salad lover! He seriously gets excited to go every Saturday morning after soccer lessons. The staff here are friendly and accommodating. We will continue to be regulars!,2
"Despite the hustle bustle of a prime student location, this Starbucks manages to serve their clientele very efficiently and without error. They don't show any contempt when people place those complicated orders during the rush and the staff have always been smiling!",2
We've only been here once and it was for take out. When we got home everything was still nice and hot and tasted fresh. The staff was friendly and there was a fun band playing while we waited for our to go order. We'd definitely make our way back here again.,2
"Simply love their vegetarian dishes and chilled ambiance. The service could be faster but their food is worth waiting for. Except for desserts, which would have a greater selection, Shambala is perfect for a group outing!",2
"I ate here for the first time last year. Any place where you can get RED KOOL AID DRANK is okay in my book. I had the chicken and waffles, why try anything else on the first visit? Would be nice if they offered a nap room for the post meal food coma. This will knock you on your ass.",2
"We have been coming here since the days they opened the doors in their first AZ place in Old Town Scottsdale. Best pizza west of the Mississippi. One complaint I'd like to see them bring back the cucumber salad Fulton Street, I think it was called . The salad choices are OK, but not great.",2
"My family and I had lunch at Full House BBQ today and the food was amazing. We tried 2 types of pancit, pork skewers and both types of egg rolls and everything was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",2
If you want some great pizza this place is a must try. I have tried several of their non meat options and I can tell you I have never been disappointed. They are OH SO GOOD! I would definitely check them out if you can afford to splurge a little more then your average pizza place.,2
"Amazing. I have been all over Europe and seen many things, and this ranks up there with anything I have ever seen. There is no way to really describe this, so I would just go see it. It is cheap and South Mountain is nice when it is cool out.",2
"Finally! I found someone who can cut short hair for women, and with a funky edge to it. Michelle is very detailed and knows how to personalize your hair. Also with color she knows what you want right away and is very quick to mix and apply it. Great job! Thanks Michelle.",2
"I had the noodles with chicken broth and the fried rice, the dishes came out quickly and well done despite the dining room being full. The menu is compact the service efficient nI would recommend it to anyone for an informal quick, well cooked and presented meal",2
Simple steel concrete and glass design throughout the building. Could use more art but i think thats the way they like it. Staff is nice. Good place to live if you're looking for a place to stay a while on the strip.,2
Great food and a casual atmosphere. n nThe food is good. I recommend the brisket nachos. They are delicious. n nThere are lots of TV's and it is open to the hotel and casino floor. Great place to grub. I have never had to wait for a table there.,2
My family and I eat here all the time. I would put this food up against any Thai restaurant in town. Every time we go the food is consistently delicious and the owners and waitresses are very personable and friendly. n nGive this place a try you won't regret it. The house noodle dish is fantastic.,2
"I love this place. Pretty big, awesome customer service. And AMAZING food. It was in a little corner and God they definitely deserve more business. nLove that place. I go every once in a whole, the variety on the menu is almost endless. There were a couple mess ups but none the less, great food",2
My friend and I went for the Margaritas. It was nice that our server was so knowledgable in Tequila that he opened our minds to try something new. We ordered food and we definitely could have shared. The portions are worth every penny. We had such a great time we went back the next night.,2
I absolutely loved this place. Took my kids for the first time and they were in heaven! Prices were great and it was kept very clean which is probably hard with all the traffic that goes thru there! Will be back most definitely!,2
"I've had generally very good experiences with both the sales team and the service team. My two year lease expires in two months, and I plan to get another A4 from here again. n nAs far as car buying experiences go, and service experiences go, this is definitely much better than the norm.",2
"It's not the same as South Beach but for the middle of the desert, they're doing a great job. They just had the small stone crab claws when we were in for lunch but between those, a massive order of fried shrimp and two half orders of sides we were more than stuffed.",2
"Been a while since I reviewed this place. It's still good. Their menu still has a variety of tiems, and I still think they are a bit over priced. But being in their email club I get coupons fairly frequently, and they make it a good value.",2
