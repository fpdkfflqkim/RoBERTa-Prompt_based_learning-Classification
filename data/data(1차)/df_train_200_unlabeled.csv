"Great concert venue! I even brought my parents with me once and, even though the mezzanine was closed, they allowed us to sit up there seeing as my mother's mobility is reduced. So A for the staff too!",2
"To me pho in general doesn't make me jump with excitement, it once did when I would eat a bowl once in a great while but now it seems like I've had pho some where every week this past year. Who knows how many large bowls of pho I've gone through in the last 12 months, it's definitely more than all my prior years combined, lots of liquid. n nAnyways Bamboo Bistro has grown on me it's not just a pho place they serve more than pho. Their pho is good though I can't tell the difference between good pho and really good pho. I remember it satisfying my cravings each time. They have a decent selection of items to choose from and add to your pho. I enjoyed the pho rare steak, cooked beef, and meat balls. I also enjoyed the pho rare steak and brisket. I've haven't tried the oxtail or beef stew yet but that's on my list next. The broth was good, usually I need to load my pho with a lot of sriracha and hoisin but I didn't here, just a little. n nFor their non pho, I've had their grilled pork. It was a more than generous portion of food and you could probably split it with another person. It was I think 3 pieces of grilled pork topped with 2 fried eggs, a large scoop of rice, and house salad. I've seen others in the group order the katsu, the tilapia, and the salt and pepper shrimp plates and they were all delicious looking. Their egg rolls are good also. They make various Asian desserts and drinks. n nIt's spacious with a nice flat screen TV on the wall. Clean with good customer service and they're good with getting large groups in and then out with no problems. Most of their items are under 10 which is always good.",2
"I love the all you can sushi here! I stop by this place every time I go to Vegas. n nThe sashimi is pretty fresh and you get two orders of uni and sweet shrimp included in the all you can eat too! I wish they allowed more. They have a huge selection, ranging from nigiri, sushi rolls, hand rolls, to cooked food like yakitori and dynamite which i looove but don't recommend for all you can eat because it's very filling and prevents you from eating more sushi and sashimi . n nOne of my favorite sashimi is salmon, and since it is not one of the limited quantity ones, I tend to order a lot of it. But what I've noticed is that, the first order is always REALLY FATTY and tasty, but as you order more and more, it just gets less and less fatty, to the point where the taste of salmon is gone. I don't know why that happens, but I have noticed that every time I've been there about 5 times . n nIn the end, I still go to this place every time I go to Vegas because it's just such a good deal and it's good quality sushi for the price you pay. Good variety, fresh sushi, great price, can't go wrong with that.",2
"Lark Key is nice little gallery in South End with paintings and a few postcards and small trinkets. The pieces are really beautiful, but definitely pricey. It'd be nice if they had a ""value "" or clearance section for middle class art lovers ",2
Like it!,2
"Holy crap what a disaster. I can only pray that the ones on the east coast are better than this. If this really is Obama's favorite place, I might have to reconsider my support of him. I don't even know where to begin. n nLet me just make a list of WTF items nWicked loud music with no theme or genre nA bin of peanuts that people manhandle while in line nPeanut shells on the floor n ""regular "" burgers have two patties n ""little "" burgers that are 5 n nJust a disaster. Go to Smashburger, please. You'll love it. This place, however, is a joke. Also, if you have a peanut allergy, I REALLY wouldn't recommend going in here.",1
This store used to suck but it looks like recently they've shaped up. Top customer service and the pharmacist is very knowledgable.,2
Im Caf u00e9 sieht es aus wie bei Oma. Die Torten und Kuchen sind allerdings modern. Und schmackhaft. Meinen koffeinfreien Kaffee mochte ich nicht so gerne.insgesamt aber eine gute bis sehr gute Konditorei.,2
This is a place I would skip on your vegas vacation it's a dysfunctional restaurant with what should be the main attraction on the meat side of entr u00e9es lacking any flavor at all and over cooked. I'm talking about the veal osso bucco the risotto what under cooked and no bone marrow left inside the bone. Anyone can do cheap crappy pasta and dress it up but butcher a osso bucco that slow braised that's dry it should let you know it's just a joke for italian food. It also seemed that the manager was more interested in staring at the women employed their then running a restaurant not once did he touch a table while I was there and education of the staff would be ideal so everyone doesn't have a blank stare when asked a question on the food.,1
"Maybe we came on a bad night but that was so not impressive. Some of the worst service I've had in a while. They took forever to take our order in a non crowded restaurant. I barely remember what we got due to starvation messing with my brain that night. nHowever I do remember that we ordered four quail eggs for two people, and they came in one dish. One. Even if that was for one person, four eggs on a little plate? How did you expect us to eat that I wonder. Also the sashimi nigiri is definitely priced above the quality.",1
"After suffering the mediocrity of Agave, the terse life of Dos Caminos, and the overly authentic Toros, I was super excited to dine here. n nUnfortunately I won't get the chance Due to a 'private event' booking the whole restaurant on a Tuesday after work. Nothing like spending millions on renovations and not letting locals access it. n nThanks Mercadito, we're off to a great start.",1
Really fun and educational and interactive. We had a great time here! Loved the large jungle gym in the front!,2
"Probably the worst restaurant that my spouse and I have ever eaten at. This place belongs on an episode of ""Restaurant Impossible. "" I had the souvlaki the pita was literally stale, and the rice dry and undercooked. My spouse had the mushroom Fettuccine Alfredo I tasted it after she had no more than three bites. The dish tasted like undiluted Campbell Cream of Mushroom soup had been poured on top of overcooked pasta. Avoid, for the life of you. Your toilet will thank you.",1
Don't waste your precious buffet dollars here. Go anywhere else on the Strip for a wider selection.,1
"It's always nice to meet people who take pride in their work. I came here for some whiskey after a Pirates game. The bartender Chris, I believe took great pride in his recommendations and service. There should be more places like this in New York. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I would make an effort to get back here.",2
"Love my Sara! I love this place and I am so sad I moved and can't go here anymore. I saw Sara for about 3.5 years and I loved every second of it. n n1. She is great with color.fabulous glorious color. I would tell her what I was thinking and she would execute flawlessly every time. n2. The wash room.oh the washroom. Such a wonderful experience. n3. The vibe.loud, colorful, fun. If you are a big dull dud you might not like here. n4. The entire staff is super sweet. n nTips book your appointments online or checkin online and you get 10 off product. nHighly recommend Sara. I never went to anyone else there but they all seem wonderful. n nEnjoy your time there!",2
"I really hope to see these guys make it. I went by one day too early and one of the guys came out to say hello and let me know when they would open that day. We finally made it down there last night to give them a try. kinda weird to walk into a BBQ place and not smell the BBQ! There were a few families in there, everyone was waiting for food. We gave our order to the 12 or 13 year old behind the counter and she placed it to her side and we sat down to watch her spend the next 10 minutes continuing to take orders. Our slip was still on the counter. Finally the entire stack of slips was sent to the back, we joked with the table next to us that we were probably on the bottom. After quite a wait the last family that walked in got their order and left. then the couple that came in behind us got their order as we sat and waited. by now we had gotten to know them a little and they were from Kansas City. In their words the BBQ was ok. he felt that the meat should pull from the bone, which it defiantly did not do. They completed their meal and offered us some untouched ribs while we were STILL waiting for our food! We declined and finally the food comes out. Hubby takes the cornbread and immediately pushes it to the side of the table. he refused to try it even, ""Its cake, not bread! "" The ribs were ok. we pretty much thought the same, that it should pull from the bone more. The coleslaw was nothing spectacular and the rice beans were pretty much left untouched. Not a place that we would go out of our way to go to by any means. o ",1
"It doesn't matter I already have enough books to start a portable library, I still can't resist the temptation of buying more. n nLocated on the picturesque and historic George Street, this Waterstones has a fantastic fiction department that includes thousands of novels and short story anthologies. Listed in alphabetic order, it includes everyone from great American authors like Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver and Carson McCullers to award winning contemporaries like Toni Morrison, Barbara Kingsolver, Lionel Shriver and Cormac McCarthy. n nAlongside established and emerging American, African, European and Sri Lankian authors, Waterstones usually stocks a strong selection of local poets and authors. The thing I find most endearing however, is the table displays including hand written Staff Recommendations. Other shoppers might ignore these and head straight for the 3 for 2 section but it's thanks to the staff that I've bought and loved books by Margaret Atwood, Aminatta Forna, Dorothy Allison and newcomer Emma Henderson and Deborah Kay Davies.",2
"Last week I bought a 10 pack of Terrific car washes for 159, more than 80 cheaper than buying them individually and they don't charge more for my SUV or my car when it's caked with dirt. These guys are super fast and the best in the business.",2
"Nachdem ich vor ein paar Wochen schon die Werbung im Schaufenster gesehen hatte, konnte ich heute einen Tag nach der Er u00f6ffnung Karlsruhes neue ""Currywurstbude "" ausprobieren. Der Laden befindet sich im Passagehof neben dem El Taquito. n n n Zum probieren habe ich eine Currywurst ""Scharf "" mit Br u00f6tchen bestellt und ich muss sagen das Ding war richtig lecker. Serviert wird es ein wenig untypisch in einem Porzellansch u00e4lchen und Holzpiekser. Mir kommt das allerdings sehr entgegen. Die Wurst selbst war sehr lecker und der mittlere Sch u00e4rfegrad f u00fcr mich genau richtig. Ich glaube aber, dass ich mich das n u00e4chste Mal noch an ""911 "" oder ""Sudden Death "" rantasten werde. Sch u00e4rfegrad ""Au u00dferirdisch "" werde ich wohl eher nicht probieren n n n Curry76 ist komplett auf Currywurst spezialisiert und so finden sich auf der Karte fast nur Men u00fcs mit selbiger plus Beilagen Pommes, Krautsalat, Kartoffelsalat, . n n n Nebenbei wird bei Curry76 auch noch Sky Sport HD u00fcbertragen. Im Au u00dfenbereich gibt es noch gem u00fctliche Sessel und Tische, an denen man seinen Snack genie u00dfen kann. n n n Mit EUR 3,10 ist die Currywurst alleridngs nicht wirklich ein Schn u00e4ppchen. Sie ist meines Erachtens aber von sehr guter Qualit u00e4t, wird nett hergerichtet und zudem ist Curry76 weit weg vom Flair einer ""profanen "" Wurstbude also ist der Preise im Prinzip OK. Bleibt nur zu hoffen, dass Curry76 sich damit durchsetzen kann. n n n Laut Prospekt ist Curry76 ""angetreten, um zu beweisen, dass die Currywurst durchaus eine Delikatesse ist "". Da mich mein erster Test u00fcberzeugt hat, stimme ich dem zu und kann von meiner Seite den Laden nur empfehlen. n n n Ich freue mich auf weitere Meinungen.",2
"Great food and awesome service. Was only open 2 days back everything was great. This is a must for anyone on the strip. Fun, vibrant and upbeat place. Great selection of food and beer. Will be back again soon. I have never seen such great service. Gordon Ramsey knows how to do it right.",2
"This place is amazing, the food is so good and the customer service here is wonderful, they actually care about you and things in your life. Coming here again for sure!",2
Absolutely disgusting. I really do not understand what all the excitement is about. For 20 bucks I got 2 small greasy burgers and 2 orders of fries with a bunch of crap all over them. I walked out feeling robbed of my wallet and my health.,1
"This review is for their propane exchange and overall customer service. Over the past year, their propane exchange kiosk has only worked once. The standard procedure is to go to the outside machine, see if it works, verify that it doesn't and then go stand in line to pay for a propane exchange. Afterwards, a 5 10 minute wait follows for someone to come to the front of the store and unlock the propane cage. Tonight, after going through the first several steps and purchasing my propane I was told, "" Sir it probably doesn't work because all of the propane tanks are empty. "" This is after waiting a few minutes. I went back outside to verify that there are in fact propane tanks and I am now 8 minutes into my wait for a tank. The experience overall is incredibly frustrating and so much so that I no longer wish to give this location one penny of my money for any purchase period.",1
"I love Mexican food, even the ""fake "" kind that other people complain about. Well, I'm not complaining! Tacos, burritos, quesadillas, taco bowls, chips and salsa I love them all! I like how the price doesn't change if you choose steak instead of chicken. Some of the other toppings cost extra, but only get what you want and can afford. I like to add veggies to my tacos for an extra charge, but I know it's worth it for some vegetables in my meal. So I will be returning. many, many times!",2
Disappointing location. The one on Cooper and Baseline is much better. The fries were mealy and salt deprived. The Royal Burger fell apart and the meat didn't have much flavor and was excessively salty.,1
"This is our go to Friday night Pizza , we usually do delivery but an occasional pick up if they are slammed the pizza is always consistently hot fresh with the perfect crunch to the crust lots of Cheese ! Avg time for delivery is about 45 min to 1 hr on Friday nights. The one really cool thing I love is the have a rewards program where if you save 15 box tops from the pizza you get a Lg cheese pizza Free who can beat that ? So if looking for a good New York style pizza these is a great place to try ",2
"We got things STOLEN from our car whiled at valet. Didnt notice it until when we clean out the car half an hour later at the car rental return. n nCalled to file a report with security at Rio but they took it very lightly. Asked what measure would be taken when I called back. The person at the security office refused to help nor give me his name because I wasnt the person who had filed the report originally. n nAlso worth mentioning, the valet guy hustled my bf to give him tips prior to taking our car in valet. claiming the valet section is full on a Monday . he asked for tipping in advance before willing to do his job. n nNever had anything stolen from hotel valets before. I suggest to stay away from Rio valet if you want to keep the thing you bring to Vegas. n nThe saying should be changed to n nWhat you bring to Vegas, nStay in Vegas.",1
"We went here for lunch one day and after hearing so many good things, I was shocked that I didn't have a great experience. We walked in and there was no one at the hostess station, but there was someone who appeared to be a manager playing with one of the televisions who chose not to greet us. So, we waited for a few minutes before someone showed us to a table, where we waited another 5 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter who, to his credit, was swamped with tables . I can understand being busy, but the fact that there were two ""managers "" walking around, and not helping customers was what bugged me. n nWe didn't try the wings, but I had a meatball sandwich, which was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip. Ooooor, maybe the NewYorkers sensed that we were both from CHI TOWN and chose not to take care of us haha",1
I think this place went out of business. I tried to eat here twice and the establishment was closed during their listed hours.,1
Good healthy eats where everything is organic. But if eating organic food is not totally up your alley then it may seem a bit more expensive. I got the tuna sashimi salad which was really to die for. It was a nice size for me because Im not a heavy eater. Boyfriend got some steak tacos which were really good but you pay about 15 for only 2 small tacos.,1
"Went to the P.U.B. for lunch and the food is great! It is a little expensive 15 for a foot long kobe hot dog , but so o worth it. Even the presentation is cute. As people have mentioned, the service is hit or miss, but I did notice the manager hovering around making sure guests were being taken cared of. There is bar seating where you get little pails of peanuts shells go on the floor vs. the little pail of warm popcorn the tables get. There is a large selection of beers and ciders a few imported ie. strongbow and it is even possible to get a flight of samples. Next time I'm in town I'm definitely stopping here before my walk through City Center.",2
"i wouldn't recommend this company to my worse enemies. the owner told his tile guy not to put tile on the sides of my water fall. thank god i happen to show up to see how things were going. i called craig and asked why he isn't putting tile on the sides, he tells me that they don't usually do that. i thought to myself are you kidding me it would look like crap. this was about 4 years ago. now in the last week i've had to have an electrician come out to fix there crap work because when they pulled the wire though the pipe they with know regard for the plastic around the wire , has scraped some of it off and blows the fuse at the main box of the house. these guys are the worst.",1
"We went for Karaoke in the lounge, which is just past the 21 tables and across from the bar. Sun Weds nites at 8 pm. A decent size seating area in front of a stage. There's piped in music overhead which kind of competes with the Karaoke singers. This Karaoke doesn't cut it with me, because, you have to get your song choice from a binder and write down song title singer and catalogue number for the Karaoke dude. Then some idiot singers take a binder to their table and keep it there as if it's their personal binder. And lyric screen is a small screen in front of you. n nPlace is big time smokey. I couldn't believe people were actually staying there in their rooms. However, one thing I liked was a speaker in front on the sidewalk blasting the Karaoke singers singing !",1
"I FREAKIN LOVE this theater! n nFirst of all, electric reclining seats is a no brainer and I cannot believe it has taken this long for a movie theater chain to figure this out. As such, there are very few bad seats, unless you are stuck on the front row. I used to get to the movie 30 minutes before start to sit on the back row so there was no one behind me kicking my seat. But even fully reclined, there is 3 ft of space to walk through the aisle! AND buying my ticket online means I always get to sit where I choose because it is reserved seating. n nSecondly, their policy of ejecting people who, talk, text, or disrupt the movies is fabulous! I have had movie experiences ruined by people who are on their phone the whole movie, talking loudly, or being disruptive. They don't put up with it, and everyone benefits except the rude people. n nThirdly, the bar is a fantastic touch! Why more theaters don't offer this option is beyond me. Most family restaurants also have adult beverages. n nFor all this convenience and comfort, you would think that their ticket prices would be higher, but they are not! Very affordable, very convenient, and beyond comfortable. Our family doesn't want to go to the movies anywhere else!",2
Horrible! The rooms are very old and have a funny smell. We had booked this hotel for 3 nights and only stayed one night because of the room conditions. There was many bugs and the smell was overwhelming. I know for sure I will never stay here again.,1
"this place hosts so many cultural events, shows, etc. Took the wife here for the Nutcracker last week and as usual, it's such an enchanting performance. the acoustics are wonderful. we had the cheap seats and even with those, you could see and hear with complete clarity. n nthe foyer was decorated exquisitely in christmas decor. the bathrooms are plentiful and clean. before the performance and during intermission, there are multiple coffee, snack, and alcohol bars to purchase drinks snacks. n nparking in one of the nearby garages makes for an easy downtown orientation, or you can take the light rail. n noverall a great experience.",2

Showed up at Round Table on Lake Mead and was expecting to get the XL Large pizza Special BUT the guy who took our order said we needed a coupon. I tried to explain that the last 3 times I got this special I didn't need a coupon it was just a Special.but the IDIOT with the tattoo on his right arm on kept on saying I cant give it to you unless you have a coupon.everything has a code everything has a code.bla bla bla.Instead of arguing I decided to suck it up and pay the 60 bucks fo the special that should have costed me 25 or 30 because I always come to the Lake Mead location and the owner was friendly. n nNOTE to the owner.What ever happen to the customer is always right? It was obvious he knew what I was talking about and you've given it to me the past 3 times with out printing anything Ohhhh but he did give us a discount of .27 cents for Seniors Discount on the XL Special. n nDon't post a special if your not going to honor it.business 101 n nHere's the link see for your self nhttp www.roundtablelasvegas.com specials.asp n nto the DUDE with the tattoo on the right arm.there is no coupon codes on any of your other coupons that have the dotted lines.and the XL Special is just a special.it doesn't show that you need to cut it out it's just a Special which the owner told me the last 3 times and I came home to look at the link to prove I was right.Get a new job where customer service isn't involved because you suck at it.

"Even though I read the previous posts about it being too salty I decided to give it a try bad choice.I just wanted Indian food so badly . I went to the website to order takeout and there were no prices listed, just description of the food odd . When I ordered they were very nice. I told them to make the dishes chicken tikka masala and the vegetable korma mild. The dishes were tooooooooo spicy and tooooooo salty, plus the raita is thin and watery. I like spicy and can I tell you it was inedible. I called Paul who said he would take my name down but we won't be going back. Too many have said it's too salty over a long enough period of time that this must be their norm. Needless to say, 30.00 later my husband is eating cereal and I am heating ravioli for my son. I should have listened to the other reviews ",1
"This is quite the experience, it's funny cuz my cousin who lives in CA knew about this place and I live here in Las Vegas! go figure! nThe place is small and cozy.very traditional. There are many things to eat there, it was cool cuz the servings of the dishes were just enough to try it and not a whole plate of it.opens the opportunity to try other dishes with out getting to stuffed Like a buffet but better.it's cooked fresh .I left the ordering to my cuz.I had no idea what he was going to order but, hey he's family and I trusted his recommendations. I had no clue he was about to take me on a journey to a whole new realm of food! We ordered a bunch of dishes, he ordered chicken gizzard which was good but, he just told me it was chicken! he ordered beef tongue, told me it was beef.hmm. he was so vague! and only after I ate it he told me what it was! nNote to self remember to ask the right question! LOL! We had sushi too, a bowl of Ramen, there were many dishes it was all really good. Since then I have brought other people to try their food.although just know they are open for lunch but the menu is down to a few selected items like beef bowls, chicken bowls, curry, a very slim menu. They had told me the full menu is only at dinner time. I was bummed but, the food at lunch is also good! I would totally recommend this spot to grab some grub! nSo dining with Andrew Zimmerman so to speak, LOL! , well that was my cousins aka name that night! It was very cool to go there with him, he taught me a lot about foods and flavors! It was awesome to see the passion he has for foods!

"I had made reservations for 11 00am a few days before we went to Las Vegas to make sure we did not have to wait in line. We arrived at 10 45am in the chance we could get seated early and saw there were quite a few tables open. There were people waiting outside to get in as they were walk ups and had placed their name on the waiting list. We saw table after table fill up with walk ins, even seating a couple that had just walked up to the hostess that moment and were seated before us. After 11 00am, I checked in with the hostess again about our request for seating outside with a view of the strip, and I was told I would be seated sahortly. Five minutes later, we were eventually seated outside with the view, which was very pleasant, along with the weather. From that point on, the experience was great. We ordered the grilled artichoke with remoulade, an order of the pank crusted mac and cheese with truffle oil, sweet potato fries, and the double frozen hot chocolate for two. The food was very good, much better than I expected. The artichokes were seasoned and grilled nicely, with a nice smokey flavor, and plenty of yummy dipping sauce. The macaroni was rich and decadent which the kids said was the best ever. The sweet potato fries came in this cute little ail, and were crispy and well done. The frozen hot chocolate was as good advertised, with whipped cream and pieces of chocolate in the drink. The waitress service was friendly and efficient and provided our family with a great experience after a rough start.",2
"Some friends and I arrive and are greeted promptly by the hostess. We choose to sit at the bar for the conversation with the bartenders and football being shown on television. n Comme u00c7a offers a wide range of pre prohibition cocktails, extensive wine list and limited craft beer on draft. I order a Dogfish Head 90min IPA. Draft beers are served in chilled glasses, which is not always a good option, and a non chilled glass was unavailable. n We started with appetizers, Tarte Flamb u00e9e, Duck Confit, and Escargots. All excellent choices with the Escargots being some of the best I've ever had, and I love the new plating. nI order a Comme u00c7a Burger. Deliciously prepared. The hardest part is trying not devour it to quickly. n There was a mistake and an order of Charred Calamari was offered to us. This was the highlight of the night. Served in Squid ink, it's fantastic. I will be ordering this again and you must try. n Mixologist Lyn and bartender Melissa offer great conversation and knowledge.

"My boyfriend and I booked a trip to Vegas and decided about 2 weeks prior to our trip that we wanted to add a night. Being that it's the Sunday or Memorial Day weekend, we knew a strip hotel was probably out of the question. Not only were the prices through the roof, but everything was sold out. We chose to stay off the strip one night and then transition on to the strip for the rest of our stay. We choose the cannery, and I'm really glad we did. n nConveniently located off of Craig road, it's about a 15 minute drive to and from the strip. The hotel is nice, clean, and the king bed was huge! It is an off strip hotel, so if you want to be in the center of things, you obviously won't, but it is close to the speedway, shops, and dinning. It does have a decent casino if you want to stay in for the night. We will certainly consider this an option when adding nights or even for a short Vegas stay.",2
This place has been spiffed up a lot since last time I went a year ago . The banchan were good mainly different kinds of kimchi . The dol sot bi bim bab was everything you could ask of a bowl of blazing hot rice and veg. The beer was cold. The service was timely and not intrusive. The menu has a lot of interesting things for which I will certainly return. Yay for actual Korean food in Charlotte.,2
"I typically rent my cars through Enterprise, but this experience has me shaking my head. I landed less than 30 minutes early and went to get my rental. When I got to the counter I was told they didn't even have a car the property and would make some phone calls. They told me they had another car, but they wanted to charge me extra. I've always been upgraded at no extra cost in these situations I booked my car through hotwire and was told that by choosing a compact over economy that I would get more features. However, when I got my car it didn't even have cruise and I had to put on about 300 miles. The car didn't drive straight, wasn't that clean front windshield was streaked from the inside and something was spilled in the center cup holder. There were no power seats or adjustable steering wheel. I found a lever, but it didn't seem to do anything broken maybe? I was mostly upset that the car didn't have cruise, you would think that would be a standard feature. When I returned the car and the lady asked me how it was, I told her that I was unhappy, but she didn't seem to really have anything to say except when I told her my biggest complaint was that it didn't have cruise, she did say that the guy who issued the car to me at the airport should have told me that. Come on Enterprise. you can do better than this!",1
"With no outlets in sight and wifi more unreliable than Spring in Waterloo, it's pretty clear Williams doesn't want you to spend all day in their cozy booths. n nWilliams is a great place to have lunch highly recommend the BLT A or a coffee with friends. Yet it's not a coffee shop like Starbucks where you feel comfortable studying or reading all day in. n nOverall, I'm a fan, but think great lunch spot rather than cozy coffee shop.",2
"This place made me ANGRY! nIt's been a while since I've been in, and I remember how delicious it was, but I guess I forgot how expensive it was for what I was getting. I remember the crawfish etouffe was delicious, so I can recommend that, but for 20.00? I skipped it. nMy friend and I ordered the frog legs, 1 dozen gulf oysters the only thing worth coming in for 3.95 and we split the Bay Platter. nMy main gripe here is that EVERYTHING TOOK FOREVER and we even arrived early before the crowds! The people behind us were seated long after us, were served and finished and left before we even got our entree they had a female waiter who seemed totally on it , and meanwhile our waiter's presence was bordering Bigfoot mythical. nThe beers took 10 minutes even with the bar in sight, the frog legs took a while and there weren't many on the plate delicious though , and the oysters came THIRTY MINUTES LATER. n ""I don't know WHY the oysters are taking so long. "" OH COME ON! There's ZERO PREP involved with these, don't play me for a damn fool! I sure wish I could remember the waiter's name so his inattentive chicanery can be fully exposed. I was too angry to remember 2 minutes after walking out the door. nIt was AN HOUR before our entree arrived, and like a previous reviewer said, it was one step above Red Lobster, but how can you screw up lobster and jumbo shrimp? Dirty rice and green beans also on the platter. I scarfed down my half, I was starving after waiting to grow old for so long sitting there. nI am generously giving 2 stars because the food tasted good and was well prepared. No one is getting their value for the money, you're paying for the waitstaff and the overhead. nFancy white linens, high prices and high dollar inattentive waitstaff to serve me Cajun food, that's not what it's about, is it? NO WAY! n nLOOK OUT PAPPADEAUX, there's a new player in town and they are CAJUN SEAFOOD CORNER in Mesa. Casual, not fancy, better value and delicious. Their crawfish etouffe is only 9.99! No longer will I have to feel like I've been extorted by Don Fanucci.",1
"I had new laminate floors installed today and could not have been more pleased with my decision to work with the folks at Empire. From the sales person, Robbie to the installer Jim and Rob everything was absolutely wonderful. The installation was amazing, from moving the furniture like it was their own to removing the old carpet and padding as well as all of the trash. You would have never even known they were there. They took great pride in their work and it showed. I would highly recommend this team for any flooring needs that you might have.I had bids from several other companies and they price met the bid to get my business. I am glad that I went with them as the result was awesome. They know their business and it shows. The Customer service person and the sales rep both stopped by the day of install and I even got a Customer Satisfaction call during the install in case I had any questions. Can't ask for more attention than that. Love my floors it is like I have a brand new house!",2
"I spent the better part of weekend and a lot of my bank account on this spa, so you'd think it would be 5 stars, but here's why not n n1. price, not super expensive, but hey, it's NOT cheap n n2. got a couples massage first day w husband. His was meh, so was mine. Maybe the therapists, not sure. Wasn't awful or anything, but I've had better for the price. n nHowever, I spent the next day got a cocoon OHMYGAWD, you should totally get one! then a facial. Was so relaxed I signed up for a full body massage. Had lunch while waiting in the cafe. nThe facial was AMAZING. I'm not sure how or what she did, but WOW! nBecause of the facial I signed up for another massage which was too rough I usually like them that way the next day. So 4 stars instead of 5. Also LOVED the water area, the different saunas, hot tub, relaxing area the salt grotto was my favorite. nFound the wave room to be odd bird chirping, not wave sounds.wha? ",2
"I stayed at the William Penn for Mathfest 2010 don't judge! and one of my former professors treated me to a birthday lunch here. It is fantastic! nThe service was impeccable as was the hotel stay and the food was lovely. nI had the roasted pear and arugula salad. In a city that puts French fries on their salads this was a breath of fresh air. The salad was amazing, it had a light sherry vinaigrette, bleu cheese crumbles and caramelized walnuts! nMy dinning companion had a pan seared salmon with garlic cream sauce, veggies and bazmatti rice. She raved about it the rest of the trip. nWe shared a HUGE piece of strawberry shortcake which was also amazing. n nIf you are in town this is a great place to go, they also serve High Tea in the afternoons by reservation.",2
I really enjoy shopping at TJ Maxx. It is one of those places I can just wander around. You never know what you will find and that makes shopping fun. The store is clean and pretty organized. Staff seems pretty friendly overall.,2

"How could a resort go so bad so fast. Soiled linen and poor maid service would normally turn me off. However from August 28 to September 3, 2013 the smell of raw sewerage emanating throughout the elevators, lobby and up to our 8th floor was outright disgusting. Throw in my casino host and hotel manager saying they didn't smell it was the last straw. I am out never coming here again ",1
"When in Vegas, splurge a bit because. Vegas. My friends really wanted to try this place out, so here we go. n nThe prices for the burgers aren't too bad, somewhere between 12 16 bucks like any other high end burger joints. The burgers here are pretty bomb. I got the Chanterelle Burger. I liked it a lot and the meat was cooked just right for medium rare. The Truffle Fries were great and the Creme Brulee Oreo Milkshake wasn't all that bad. The shake might have been a bit too sweet for me though personal preferences . n nAnd you could totally try different burgers by cutting and exchanging your burger with friends. Trying different burgers for the price of one. Yay. n nAnyway, great quality of food and wonderful costumer service.",2
"We recently enjoyed a delicious lunch at Arcadia Farms cafe at the Phoenix Art Museum. The leek mushroom goat cheese tart I had was delicious. Similar to a quiche, but so much better, good sized, and having a flaky crust, the tart was served with a nice salad of greens and tomatoes. Coffee was excellent and the service too! n nThe dining experience had one down side and that was the noise level it was so loud that it was difficult to converse. Just sitting through the din was an ordeal. The Cezanne show had just opened so the dining room was very full. The quality of the food made it a worthwhile visit though!",2
"Love the new digs, but really the line to check in. Even being a diamond level hilton honors? Your check really need some improving! Come on Trop!",1
"Went to see Meat Loaf a few days ago. To say that it was terrible would be an insult to truly terrible shows. It was stunningly bad. Uncomfortable to watch. Painful to listen. n nIn fairness, Meat Loaf has always been over the top and goes all in on every song he sings and everything he does. You know that going in. It's either going to be an epic success or a train wreck. There is no middle ground with Mr. Loaf. This particular evening was a train wreck. Not the normal kind where the train derails and a couple cars flip over. This was the kind where someone falls asleep at the switch and six trains collide, with 250 cars in a mangled pile of wreckage. In the rain. n nAs others have acknowledged, the band and the backup singers were quite good. The venue is fine. Had Meat Loaf's vocals not sounded like a bag of cats, it would have been a great evening.",1
"Our super shuttle experience was overwhelmingly positive. We booked the service online when we were almost out of the airport gates, and yet, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes. There were 7 of us, with tons of luggage 20 huge suitcases weighing 50 lbs each, 5 smaller suitcases and lots of laptop bags . The shared ride service just about managed to fit us all in the same vehicle all credit to our wonderful driver, Jason. n nTalking about the driver, he was the reason our experience was so good. Not only did he load all of our luggage without complaint, he provided us with ample information about the city. He also gave us plenty of tips about restaurants and coffee shops in the area where we are going to live. He clearly loves the city, and his enthusiasm rubbed off on us. Many of us were coming to the country the first time and it was a pretty awesome welcome for us!",2
"This is probably my favorite buffet of the ones I've been to in Vegas. It's not cheap by any means but the quality of the food you get is excellent. The staff is friendly and attentive and we always had our drinks full. n nWhat makes them stand out is their ability to do ethnic food well. I had some of their Indian dishes which were superb. Their naan was yummy and filling. But my favorite dish of all was their chicken panang curry which was just as good as any I've had at most Thai restaurants. n nOverall, its a great value for the Wynn. It's even better than some of the other restaurants at the resort ahem Bartolotta ",2
"I had been wanting to try Mi Patio for a long time. But since it's all the way ""in the avenues "" as my husband says, it's taken awhile. n nI have to say I was almost a little disappointed upon arriving to find that it is a fairly nice restaurant, not the hole in wall, don't look under the table, in the window sills, and especially the kitchen, kind of place that we all know have the BEST food. And with a nicer store front usually comes a higher price tag. Mi Patio is no different. Combination plates are in the 10 range. Kind of expensive for Mexican food in my opinion. Perhaps I'm still living in 1978. n nIn spite of that, we were seated and introduced to their chips and salsa. The chips, unfortunately, were cold. Had they been hot, they would have been the thin and crispy tortilla chips I love. But the salsa was really really really good. n nBecause my husband and I have vowed to eat less in 2010, we shared a meal, an appetizer in fact. Unfortunately, it was the 17 appetizer supreme that would have fed half of Mexico. A pizza sized platter filled with mini chimis, flautas, red chile nachos, and gyro slices I thought that was odd, but my husband loved them . We had wonderful service with two people making sure our drinks were kept filled. n nThe sampler had enough variety for me to learn I will happily make the trek back to ""the avenues "" for Mi Patio again.",2
This place is totally cute inside and i guess i expected the food to be just as good as the place looked but ended up being super disappointed. n nBf just the grilled cheese that came with bacon and he was not that impressed. It was more like an overload on cheese and tasting like a goopy quesadilla on soggy bread and my sandwich was all wrong when i got it. I was on a lunch hour and got frustrated and didn't have time to wait so ended up getting my money back for my sandwich. n nwompwompwomp was hoping this would be a new little go to sandwich spot.,1
Well where to start first let me say they have crazy hours are not open past 7 o'clock?so today we finally caught up with them the sushi was not good and the service was even worse. We ordered iced tea and they didn't have any sugar and then didn't even know what sweet and low was. I think owner dug out a couple of sugar packets from her purse I swear no lie we ordered the average sushi California roll etc. etc. and we ordered the crunchy crab roll but guess what there was no crunch on we asked if it was supposed to be crunchy he said yes and walked away we also ordered a A beef teriyaki roll but they had no beef so then we said fine give us a chicken teriyaki roll apparently they had chicken but there wasn't any teriyaki on it at this point we just wanted to leave but we couldn't because their computers were down and they couldn't except debit cards they failed to tell us this before we ordered any food so I had to leave my wife there and tried to find ATM to find cash to pay the bill they should do everyone a favor and stay close more often.,1
"Bleh. The Orleans was never a show stopper. It was never one of those ""great "" casinos in Las Vegas. However, it has stayed alive. Probably because of its location, where there are no close casinos to compete with and its low prices. I'm sure locals are happy to gamble here as well, keeping the money flowing. Not to mention The Orleans stays alive with its large events stadium which hosts numerous events, including the Las Vegas hockey team. n nAs for the casino it is stinky like a rag of chew stuffed in the shirt of a non stop chain smoker. Yes, obviously The Orleans has not updated its ventilation system and prefers its visitors to be enraptured in the smell of cigarettes. n nThe casino at least hosts a decent movie theater removed from the casino floor on a second level. As for the restaurants I cannot comment on them since I've never been in any of them. The only one I am slightly interested in going to is Fuddruckers, which I didn't even know they had until a most recent visit to see a movie. n nI also cannot comment on the rooms, but considering the grungy feel and nasty smell of the casino I would not bother staying here anyway. n nOrleans would be a lot better if they just got a better ventilation system, and they would probably need to tear out their carpet and put new carpet in. Of course, I rarely frequent the casino, so they need not do it just for me. haha.",1
"The Luxor is obviously supposed to be dreary and gloomy since it is imitating a pyramid. But. it just doesn't work for a themed hotel resort casino. It just feels off, especially with everything else The Strip has to offer. Even just walking through here is kind of dreadful so I just avoid the southern part of The Strip all together sorry, Mandalay Bay! . I'd recommend staying at other hotels the room rates may be cheaper here, but I think you can find some comparable prices at much better hotels on The Strip.",1
Who wants to wait an hour for cold food?! Terrible service with a side of burnt bacon is what you can expect here. God forbid you need silverware.,1
The staff was wonderful here. Our waitress Whitney was oustanding. Food was great also. They were very accommodating to a couple of Hawkeyes and Buckeyes fans who were in town for the weekend to have a good time with friends. We will be back.,2
"I'm seriously shocked by some of the poor reviews written about the Men of OG. I had the great pleasure of experiencing this wonderful establishment during the 1st weekend of May for my Bachelorette 30th birthday extravaganza. Prior to this weekend I had never been to a male strip club and was warned by friends to not expect Magic Mike, but more of the cheesy fanfare. Boy, were my friends wrong. All I can say is AH mazing! n nWe walked up to the 2nd floor and I was immediately amazed by the half naked bodies walking around the room and the men performing skits on stage e.g., man dressed up as a fireman lights a match and has my friend blow it out and continues to strip out of his gear. I'm about to faint just thinking about it . The ladies in the audience were pumped and wild, which added to the crazy, intense atmosphere. Most of the male dancers were very handsome and had gorgeous bodies. They were respectable, but yes some of them can be pushy. I don't mind because I work in sales and I get they need to make . All you have to do is say no thank you and they will leave you alone. A lap dance costs 20 and 40 gets you a lap dance on stage. I think these prices are well worth the experience! n nPros n1. Tony aka Spartacus n2. Carlos n3. Jimmy n4. Limo pick up n5. ATM 1.00 surcharge fee n6. The dancers and staff were all very nice and friendly n nCons n1. One of the dancers whipped his penis which was clothed in a banana hammock across my face and I really didn't want it, nor like it. n2. The drinks are pretty weak n3. After the waiter delivers your two drinks he she disappears to never be seen again n nThe pros especially 1.I love you Tony! definitely outweigh the cons, so I will still award OG 5 stars! I had so much fun that I returned a 2nd night and me and two of my bridesmaids shut the place down. I highly recommend this place for any birthday, bachelorette, or girls' night out. n nTips I highly recommend going on Friday and Saturday nights off days no fun , don't violate the men that's just plain rude n nThanks for the fun time OG.I definitely plan to return in the near future!",2
"This was not a great carpet cleaning experience. I'm sure that there are better companies to go through, and I will be using them next time. n nWe chose this company because it was recommended to us by our apartment complex. We called two days ahead of time, and were told someone would be there to clean the carpets between 12 5 on our chosen day. Sort of a big window, but whatever. n nOn the day, we called around 2 to see if they had any idea when someone would be coming. We were told someone would be there by 4. At 4 05, with still not carpet people, we called again, and were told, it will be another 40 minutes. At 4 35, we received a call saying it would actually be another 45 minutes. At this point, we were getting pretty unhappy that we had sat around for the carpet cleaners all day, and they were not not even showing up in the 5 hour window we'd been given. We called the company back to complain, and the woman on the phone snapped at us that ""it isn't even 5 yet "" refused to consider giving us a discount, and basically said she didn't care that we would be relaying this information to our apartment complex. n nAround 5 45, the carpet people finally showed up. Two men came in, quickly assessed the place, and got to work. I will give one star to the man who actually cleaned the carpets. He worked hard, and did a great job. I have no complaints about him. His partner, on the other hand, was literally on the phone the entire time he was at our apartment, and besides briefly spraying the some kind of chemical out of a spray bottle here and there, he basically did nothing, and was not needed for the job. Maybe if those two guys split up, and worked separately, they could been on time. Apparently, two people were not necessary for the job. n nOne other benefit was the price. It was 50 to do an entire two bedroom apartment. I will say it was a good price, and if you are on a super tight budget and can take the entire day to wait for these guys to show up, this might not be a bad choice for you. But overall, with the waiting, the overtly rude treatment on the phone, and watching one hard working guy who something tells me doesn't get paid as much as the dude who spent the whole time on the phone, I have to pass on this place for next time, and try someone else who is a little more professional.",1
"All of the cues are warped and none of the bands were true, but hey, that's Le Skratch. It was fine for what it is. n nWhat bothers me though is that the attendant started the clock on our table before we even presented the ID, let alone got to our table. The extra 0.25 is obviously more important to them than showing the absolute minimum respect to their clients. n nNext time I'm up for pool, it'll be at Shooters across the street.",1
I can see this little gem becoming a regular habit. The service and food were both wonderful and I loved the comfy feel they have inside. n nI tried to finish their specialty a Havarti Roasted Asparagus panini with ham and couldn't do it. It's enough for two. Next time I'll do the 1 2 1 2 option. n nThe sandwich had a little spice to it come to find out they roast the asparagus with some red pepper flakes and they roast their own meats! Add to that the delicious pesto mayo and the fab bread and I'm sold! n nI must come back for a overly indulgent slice of cheesecake! n nThanks Bertha staff!,2
"If you have been looking for a true hole in the wall Mexican restaurant for cheap tasty authentic Mexican cuisine, this is your place. I must have driven by Juan's a thousand times on my way to work without ever noticing it. It is a totally non descript cinder block building with no windows or obvious entrances. It's a little scary looking, especially since it is right next to the 51. Trust me. You need to check it out. Inside is a bustling family run restaurant that feels like home. The food is really good. I have already been back several times since being introduced to Juan's by a friend. It is destined to become a part of my restaurant rotation.",2

"This joint is pretty nice, but completely over rated and PACKED, so much so that it isnt even fun.

Every time I go to the hot new club in vegas its like so packed you cant do anything but feel miserably chlosterphobic. PASS and find a lower key bar.",1
"CheezHeadz is awesome! Their pizza is amazing! Their sandwiches are really good too! I have never had a problem with the meat being overcooked or having a burnt bun. I work near by and so our office orders from them often . They also have this Strawberry Spinach Salad with candied pecans and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing and I add avocado. It is INCREDIBLE! The owner, Craig is very nice and he does remember your order and other helpful things. He is very efficient and remembers to add in a plastic fork and knife to my to go order every time I order I must say it is great knowing that every time I make an order that I know he will add my utensils all because I asked him to add it the first time I ordered . This place is wonderful!",2
I absolutely love this place! The best place in Madison next to The Nile on Odana to get Mediterranean food. One thing that I think would be beneficial to this place is remodeling for a larger capacity. It is pretty teeny. Great local place!,2
"While I am very surprised to be the first to review this fabulous Italian eatery, I also find it to be a pleasure as well! n nNestled in the heart of Carefree's shopping centers and eateries on Easy Street located right next to a nail salon is this quaint, elegant, and sophisticated little restaurant. Inside there are about 15 20 tables. I had made a reservation for our party of 4 not knowing how busy it would be on a Friday evening at 7 in Carefree and I'm glad I did. This joint was hopping! n nWe were given water and a basket of delicious toasted and warm bread with an herb butter. I'm so tired of those ""trendy "" places that think Olive Oil and balsamic is a proper topping on bread. Not so at Giordano's.they offer olive oil but the butter is where it's at. n nWe were greeted promptly by our server who suggested a great wine for us. We ordered calamari as our appetizer. Calamari isn't my favorite because it's usually so overcooked and chewy that it's just not worth the money. Giordano's used panko breading and these calamari were fried perfectly. The accompanying marinara sauce was fantastic as well. Not too sweet and not too tangy. n nOne of my party ordered the chicken and the other veal marsala. I ordered the Giordano's chicken which was chicken parmesan but with a slice of eggplant onto of the chicken before it was breaded. It was fabulous. The veal was fork tender and very flavorful. The chicken marsala was not over cooked like some tend to be and each of us had an accompanying side of vegetables and our choice of penne or spaghetti. We all chose penne and it was perfectly cooked. The vegetables were al dente and had been tossed in a buttery sauce. They weren't dripping in the sauce, but rather, the sauce was just kissing the veggies. It was quite heavenly. n nFor dessert we shared a tiramisu and cheesecake. I am usually not a fan of tiramisu because the ones I've experienced had such a strong coffee flavor that it was off putting. Not so at Giordano's. This was tiramisu with a background flavor of coffee like it's supposed to be. The cheesecake was rich, creamy, and probably the very best i've ever had, and I've had NY cheesecake in some of the finest NY restaurants. n nOur server was friendly and non intrusive. The busboys were equally non intrusive and kept to themselves. It was a bustling place and while these servers and bus people were busy, they never made you feel like you were bothering them. n nI highly recommend Girodano Trattoria Romana in Carefree. It is pricy, but you have to expect that given the location and the local clientle. I am trying to figure out a way to make an excuse to drive up there REAL SOON! ",2
"The only decent thing on the menu is the salmon but even that is average at best. Avoid if you can. The place looks dingy, the staff looks surly, and the edamame is limp. I don't see the point of this place.",1
"Until around a year ago, this was the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas and remains a favorite. On our most recent visit we ordered naan, basmati rice, chicken tika marsala and rata lamb.

"My family ate here the evening of March 29th 2012. After we were done eating I took my 4 year old to the bathroom to wash her hands and saw a live roach on his back wiggling his legs in the air. I asked a female staff member to come to the restroom and showed this to her all she said was ""well we get sprayed for bugs every week so maybe he just crawled up the drain and the bug company says there is no guarantee "" I dont know about everyone else's pest control companys but any that I have ever talked to say that you should not see any bugs between spraying. Needless to say I am disgusted and will be reporting this restaurant to the health dept.",1
"We really enjoyed our dinner at the Gallery restaurant. The service was fantastic and we loved our waiter Billy's suggestions and easy going manner. We opted for the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings also known as the adventure menu. Nothing we were served was currently on the menu. Our first course was amazing. I had the fabulous french onion soup by special request. There is a reason it is the best french onion soup in Charlotte. My husband had a great shrimp and scallop cerviche. This was the best dish of the night! The delightfully warm gruyere popovers were fabulous and it was hard to hold back with all the food to come. Our next two dishes were both a fresh fish. Both were perfectly cooked. One was served over a selection of matchstick vegetables with curry. We thought it had a good balance. n nThe only dish that was a miss was the lamb. Meat didn't have a lot of flavor and the texture was not pleasing. It may not have been a good cut. The mashed potatoes were wonderful. nThe desserts were great! My husband enjoyed a nice piece of cheesecake with a house made sour cherry topping and I had a yummy chocolate pralaine tort with an amazing artesian marshmellow and some chocolate ""art. "" n nDinner was at a nice leisurely pace as we were making an evening out of it. The wine and scotch selections are extensive.",2
"Love this place, best gel manicure ever it last for 3 weeks . People are super friendly, clean nice relaxing looking environment. They have a loyalty program where you get points so far I have had gel nails done several times, pedicure and eyebrows and I have been happy every time!",2
"they should have stayed in Chicago. The worst service and one of the poorest restaurant experiences I have had in years. We never could figure out who our waiter was! They would take orders and disappear for eons. nMy wife's pizza was delivered first and was almost airport quality no sauce, almost no cheese and no flavor. Then 10 minutes later our friends pepper pasta arrived with no discernible pepper taste. Finally nAfter every one else had finished eating my entree arrived about a half hour after the first entree was served. I'd give this place six months before they fold up shop.",1
"Pros qualitty, authenticity, and TASTE! n nCons service, price, atmosphere n nCan't stress the taste points enough it's awesome flavor, but definitely get this to go or eat by yourself the place is clean but the decor is from at least two decades ago you're not going to impress anyone bringing them here. n nQuality is definitely there, this is a mom and pop shop in every way, but it's more like mother and father in law service when it comes to serving and attention. They are in the kitchen a lot if you need anything you have to go to the desk and call in. n nPortions are satisfying but not filling and for the same money you can get more food elsewhere. Still, it's not expensive and is both authentic and tasty.",2
"I had not eaten at this particular Panda until now. The guy behind the counter confused me a little bit because he looked at me like he was ready to take my order, but then started talking to another person behind the counter. Then I started to say what I wanted, but I still didn't have his full attention. Hmph! Had to start giving my order about 3 times before he was ready to listen. The chow mein looked a little sad but I was getting fried rice so it was okay. The mixed veggies were also sad looking but the guy was nice enough to ask my boyfriend if he wanted fresh vegetables he did . A lot of the food actually looked fresh. particularly the honey sesame chicken and sweet fire chicken. But I was getting the teriyaki chicken which is pretty much always fresh. They packed my Panda Bowl with fried rice and teriyaki chicken! Impressive. I noticed the sign saying their ice maker was broken so we made the decision to take our food to go so we could split a large Panda Passion tea and put our own ice cubes in it. My Panda Bowl was still hot when we got home. And it was good! The rice was cooked well and the chicken tasted fresh delicious. Best Panda we've had in awhile. Maybe next time they will have ice and we can dine in. ",2
Bunch of old guys nReally small club nThey open at 10 30 for the record not 10 28 those were the kind of comments some of the door men were saying nOverpriced for a club that will be closed by 2013 for sure n nToo many other options in Vegas to settle for this place,1
"I don't understand all the hype! n nI thought that the stripping was not very sexy but that's ok as it was entertaining. n nThe lead singer was amazing an excellent singer and great hostess! n nI found the comedian to be overly crude and un funny. I am not prudish, but did not appreciate his humor. n nOverall, it was somewhat ok, but I felt like it was WAY overpriced, and a big let down. Without the extensive involvement of the comedian, I would have liked this show more, I think but it is still way too expensive for a rather poor show.",1
"Asthma and respiratory sufferers avoid this place like the plague. It stinks to high heaven of cheap teen cologne. The merchandise is still over priced and staff is dumber than a box of rocks. On the plus side, it's a great place for decent men's sweat pants. Just make sure you don't pay full price. Also wash the clothes when you get them home, they will stink like their cologne.",1
"I get the theme of the restaurant but the service was horrible. I asked for lemon about 5x and didnt get it till I was done with my food. The food was horrible, dry and had no flavor and it was waaaayyyy over priced. You couldnt pay me to go back.",1
"If I could give lower than 1 star I would. A guest and I came in for dinner, it wasn't all that busy. The boy who was serving us was not helpful in the least. We ended up waiting over an hour for our food to come out and I had to remind him . A family of 8 came in after us.and they got their meals served before us. I was furious at this point. The manager comes over in complete defense mode.defending the boy server.he forgot to put our order in. When our food finally comes out. my order is wrong. I proceed to tell the manager.she said that she'd be right back with the correct side. I'm waiting.and waiting. 20 minutes go by and I see her walking around with her staff laughing. Never brought me what I needed. The food was horrific. The staff is inconsistent. The manager is rude.a poor excuse of a manager if you ask me. I will never go back here. And I don't recommend anyone to waist their money here.",1
"This casino may be at the edge of the Strip, but it's my favorite of all of them. n nSo many have a weird smell or a snooty vibe, but this one is perfect for me. It's laid out well I've never gotten lost here , and the parking garage actually makes sense which is rare . I usually get lost in the garages or in the casinos, but this one is easy to navigate. n nI've been here for Shark Reef a couple of times and also for conferences. I've also just gone to hang out with friends visiting from out of town. It's on the classier side without being overly full of itself KWIM? , and it's not cheesy like some of the others Circus, Circus and Harrahs . It's upscale without being pompous. Just classy. Clean. Calm. Love it.",2
My grandma spent her last days here and my mom had a great support system in the staff until I arrived in town. Grandma was treated with dignity and care until she passed. My whole family is grateful for a comfortable place for granny to reach her homecoming.,2
"Personally I enjoy trying new and exciting cuisine. So I figured I'd try the Beef Bulgogi Burger, expecting the chopped up bits like any American style shredded beef brisket. But what I received was a meatloaf style formed patty full of onions, with no other flavors, covered with lettuce, tomato, pickles and basically half of an onion after already being overwhelmed by the onion packed loaf. I hardly smelled anything but my friend and sister were not pleased haha. Said the restaurant should have named the dish Hot Onion Garbage because that's pretty much what I got. Not to mention nine dollars wasted.",1
"Not sure if I came on the wrong day, but my experience wasn't as pleasant compared to the other reviewers. I'll make this quick and painless. My pancakes came out cold. I sent them back, and received a fresh stack. There was a shortage on coffee, so my sister had to wait for more to be brewed. I ordered ice coffee, but couldn't get a refill because they ran out. The server was friendly, but overwhelmed. The taste of the food was on par with all other Ihops that I have dined.",1
"The women were all very attractive, if only it were possible to see them. Nearly every act was in near complete darkness with one light source, but even that was filtered with patterns and stripes, essentially breaking up every lady's lines with camouflage. In the end, is that not what's actually sexy? n nThe production ruined any potential talent. You're paying to see a light show to cheesy music.",1
"Krannert Art Museum is lucky to have a Director that actually believes art should stimulate and provoke thought.and that's exactly what she does with the exhibitions I've seen there so far. This would be the local equivalent to the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco . cool social events and openings for a cross generational and cross cultural crowd. What I love most about KAM is that I've had some great conversations standing around the lobby of a show and there's no snotty art culture where people blather on about ""high art "" and how it's so much better than anything and everyone. They don't play those games here, even though this is the 2nd largest art institute in IL outside of the Chicago Art Institute. Impressive, yes? Pretentious, no.",2
"Really disappointed in this place. The menu is not displayed well, so it's overwhelming to look at. The Hawaii Salad I got was bland, Unappealing looking, was brought out on plate vs a bowl, so made it harder to eat. It took awhile too. Plus, the staff was rather lethargic and didn't have a welcoming personality to them. To be honest, it doesn't appear as if the owners consulted anyone with restaurant experience or knowledge when they decided to open this place. I was really looking forward to another healthy place to eat at, but was sadly underwhelmed and severely disappointed with this place. Unless they make some major changes to their menu better display, more organized, less corn, have a calorie count I doubt I'll try it again.",1
Arrived for a late snack drinks 10 30pm with a small party. Got seated outside and had pretty spotty service. No servers or any help around for 30 mins at a time.,1
"It's obvious the draw for this restaurant is the location. It sits directly across from the Bellagio fountains, which bodes very well. If it didn't I wonder if this restaurant would still be in business with Vegas' stiff restaurant competition. n nMon Ami Gabi is very loud and a fairly small restaurant, so I wouldn't recommend if you plan on having tons of conversations. n nWe came here for celebratory dinner, I had the steak and frittes. The food wasn't bad. It wasn't great. It was just okay.and with the stiff competition in Vegas, that's just not enough particularly for the price . The steak was properly cooked with a decent sauce. n nBottom line is I'd only recommend if you want a stellar view of the fountains and don't mind paying quite a bit for okay food.",1
"if i could give this place a 10 i would! 1 star is way too much for them! worst rental car place ever! they tell you it is at the airport but you have to take a shuttle to the rental car center and then get on another shuttle and go about 10 miles to the rental car place! and when you are hauling around a ton of luggage it is the biggest pain ever! it took over 2 hours picking up the car and returning it! they have 2 people helping 100 people in line at the counter and 1 guy when you return it as well! biggest scam ever! they also give you crappy dirty rental cars and the people that work there and rude and don't know anything! we rented a ""full size "" suv and ended up with a ford edge! they charge you for everything they possibly can too! the shuttle back to the airport also only come about every 1 2 hour! do not ever rent from this place! pay the extra 10 and rent from a decent rental car place!",1
"Very good! I liked the coffee a lot and the ice cream was, of course, amazing. I also thought the employees were very friendly and welcoming. I'll definitely be back.",2
"Wonderful place to view both classical and modern art. The different wings of the building feel like completely different spaces because they contain completely different installments, yet the whole space is cohesive and contemporary. nA little tip go on Wednesday nights.

"We drove to a remote part of Las Vegas because we had a coupon for Buy One Entree, Get One Free this coupon was from the Entertainment Book, sold annually, with hundreds of participating restaurants and other businesses offering great discounts. n nWhen we finally arrived at the restaurant, we were starving we hadn't realized how far away this place was. We entered this hole in the wall Chinese place at first, it seems just like a ""fast food "" style order at the counter restaurant, but they had several tables available, and we were told to take a seat if we were dining in. We were promptly greeted by a young woman, who told us that the coupon we had wasn't going to work, as they didn't have a contract with the Entertainment Book people we had just driven half an hour to try this place out, and they weren't going to honor our coupon! Bleh! They did offer a 10 discount, however, so we decided to stay, as we were really hungry. How disappointing, however, for them not to honor a valid coupon with their name on it, that hadn't expired. Poor business practice! n nOn the plus side, they had good prices, good portion sizes however they offered table service, yet served everything on styrofoam plates. I don't mind eating off of styrofoam, but if you're going to offer table service, go to the dollar store and buy some cheap real plates to serve your customers on! n nThe food would get a 3.75 stars, but their customer service in not accepting the coupon rates them a 1 star we would never go back to a business that does something like this, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody else either.",1
"I have been twice and it hasn't disappointed yet. The service was great. Prices arent to bad. The first time we went in 08 was the best. I will never go to another pool in vegas again, only Bare.",2
"Durst is a family bike shop that's been around forever. They do a good job helping you select the perfect bike for your size and needs, and they'll do the tune ups and other maintenance.

"As you can see I am catching up on my yelping tonight. n nAll i can say about cadillac ranch in tempe is that I had the worst experience here ever. The service was horrible, and so was the manager. n nMy friends and I went there around 8 15 p.m. We just wanted to get a few appetizers and a few drinks. We had this young brunette waitress. We asked her what time they stopped serving food. I don't like to order right before to closing . She said she thinks they stopped serving at 9 30 p.m. but the bar at 1 a.m. We asked for waters to start while look over the menu. 15 minutes later, we get our waters. We tell her we're ready to order so the 5 for us order a beer each. She tells us she'll be back in a min to get our food order. 30 min pass and we still don't get our drinks. We try to flag our server down and she just tells us to wait a second. We finally get our drinks at 9 15. we were being as patient as possible, because we've all worked in the service industry before. We tell her we are ready to order food now. She tells us that they stopped serving food already! By that time I was pretty pissed. I ask to talk to the manager, and she asks WHY? haha. So by then I didn't even want to deal with a little girl who absolutely had no clue what she was doing. n nThe manager approached the table. I told him exactly what had happened. He advises us that they serve food until 1030 p.m. He apologizes about his server and says it wasn't her fault because she was busy, and she is new. By this time it was already passed 10 p.m. n nShe brings the check by and says to us, ""by the way, it only took me 10 minutes to get my drinks, not 45min. But I'm sorry. "" WOW. decide for yourselves everyone! n nHopefully that waitress found a new career, and that manager heavy set, man, with curly red hair found another career as well. How hard is it to get decent service these days?",1
"The portions are huge, and for a great price. I got the Meat Lovers Omelet, and it was purely delightful. The Home Fries were great, and is the perfect side for whatever entree you choose. I'm a visitor from CA, and this has to be one of the best breakfast places I have ever eaten at. If you are traveling, you should consider coming to Ronnie's for breakfast. You will not be disappointed.",2
"Stop! whats the point of this Hotel? Yes, its on the strip and connected to the Mandalay Bay by a tram. but other then that, I don't see any value to it. It is a sad reminder of Vegas' attempts in the 80's and 90's to lure ""families "" to Vegas. I am thankful that era is long gone. why we still have the Luxor, Excalibur and Treasure Island is beyond me. I guess that is why you can get rooms for 49 and enjoy gambling with displaced tourists from the Mid West and Florida.",1
".I don't get the Costco phenomenon.not one bit. n nAdmittedly not one with a huge family, but without a doubt the sort who buys and eats in bulk the prices here simply aren't that much better than those at Super Target or Walmart and with their limited hours 24 hr at Walmart you're almost always guaranteed to hit a crowd.",1
So I went to this Harkins for the first time recently. I was sure to park illegally in a handicapped spot and to leave my dog in the car. It's not like it's hot out and really how many people in wheelchairs go to the movies. n nOK. Sarcasm and current events aside I had big hopes as we strolled into the theatre lobby. Big. Grandiose. Clean. Helpful staff. Then. n nI. Entered. The. Theatre. n nGulp. Um. What the heck? Why are there at least a dozen random seats covered with big black garbage bags? I sat on the edge of my seat the entire movie. And not because it was a cliffhanger. I just felt dirty. Not soft porn dirty. Silkwood dirty. n nJust seemed ghetto and reminded me of the skankhole Harkins on Thomas and 36th Street. n nI may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home!,1
"Monta Ramen was scarily packed, so we came here instead. Delicious cheap ramen. What's not to like? My only complaint is the wait and cash only policy. It's a good away from the strip option.",2
"Love this place, never disappointing. I always get the chicken and waffles because the chicken is always tender and juicy and nobody can beat bacon in waffles. The espresso drinks are always spot on and the biscuit with honey butter is wonderful. I also recommend the pancakes that are literally bigger then your head in which they give you a small pizza box if you have leftovers. Go at night when they give out the biscuit and the staff is friendlier. A MUST GO here in VEGAS.",2
"Get your tickets online in advance. Good seats go quick. I bring my little movie blanket, keeps me warm and comfy. This place is as good as it gets, I wish it's like the ones in San Diego where you have a server that waits on you and seats are by two people, not in a row. The food for these theaters are actually really good. n nSo I am hoping this will upgrade on the food service.",2
"As a token of appreciation for moving in, our apartment complex gave us a menu attached to a box for this place. The purpose of the box? A FREE medium cheese pizza! n nNow, when it comes to ""real "" pizza places I personally put chains like Little Caesars, Pizza Hut and Sbarro in a different category altogether , I tend to be on the weary sides. There's so many places I hear about which allegedly make great pizza in town that I've been to in the past only to leave sorely disappointed. So yeah, I'm kinda afraid of trying new pizza places here. But seeing that it was free, it's not like I had anything to lose. n nI walked in and pretty much automatically fell in love with the place. It really reminded me of the Italian Delis I've seen in my travels to Chicago, NYC and San Francisco! The service was some of the friendliest I've ever encountered, and they offered you free chips which they make in store I should add while you wait. n nThey told me it would be 15 minutes for the pizza but barely even 10 minutes had passed before I was served. Or maybe it was 15 minutes but I was too busy browsing the store and looking at the menu to notice. They had so many different types of pasta, cheese and seasonings on the shelves. In addition to the fact that they make their own bread, cookies and, as stated earlier, potato chips. If there was a produce section you could go grocery shopping here. n nAs for the pizza itself? Delicioso! Thin, but firm slices with a minimal grease factor, a robust sauce and a generous helping of cheese. If the cheese pizza was that good, I can only imagine what it would taste like with toppings. n nThe Final Verdict n nPros nAuthentic Italian American style market nContender for best pie in Vegas nCommunity oriented business nPrompt and fantastic service n nCons nHmmm, I've got nothing n nReturn Factor 10 10. Next time I'm definitely getting me a bag of those chips, a pack of those cookies and a batch of those garlic knots everyone is raving about.",2
"Reviewing ONLY the sushi . this place makes me wonder if ""Ming Fu "" translates to ""Mediocre Food. "" n nIt was hardly the worst sushi I've ever had . but there is no reason to come here for it, either. The seaweed wrap on one of the three rolls I had was so chewy it was difficult to get through. Put it this way I had to intentionally focus on grinding my teeth through that seaweed. I didn't have time to raise my hand about it and send it back for a new one, as I was on a defined timeline that night. I would ordinarily give the chef a second shot at making it right . but then again, should I have to? n nThe fish was fresh enough not fishy . thankfully, because it was a Saturday night, not a Sunday . but it was quite bland. I love spicy tuna in general, but these rolls barely told my tongue that they were there. n nNice ambiance, and I have a number of friends who enjoy their more traditional Chinese dishes. I can't speak to that . just was disappointed to have a weak experience here and can't see much reason to give it another shot.",1
"Extensive sushi menu and extremely friendly and attentive wait staff. The screaming orgasm is to die for, and they have so many different rolls it takes time to figure out what to order. Everything was very fresh and yummy. n nWe've been back several times now and they greet us like old friends. Only drawback is we live in the northwest and they're not close enough for us to go all the time.",2
"Dear Ms. Debbie Gaby, I would like to share with you a recent experience I had at your 2501 N. Scottsdale Rd. Scottsdale, AZ 85257 store on Friday 7 18 14 around 1pm in the afternoon. I walked in with full intentions of leaving there with a lighter wallet and a receipt for a king size bed purchase in my hands, but thanks to a very well dressed salesman Mr. Richard Rico C., that did not happen. He allowed me to answer his two opening questions of how could he help me and how fast do I want it, after that he started talking about government standards, coil counts, bad backs mattress firmness, mattress height and again back to government this and government that, I finally got a chance to speak and said that I was pretty much old school and preferred to purchase something that was more original and did not include the foam rubber memory foam stuff.he began talking a thousand words a minute again and pulled a pillow off a bed, removed a chunk a foam out of a pillow case and told me that all beds were made of foam and there was no way around that, then he asked me what kind of rubber and began naming off different kinds of rubber.at this point I had had enough, I began to walk to the door and said I have to go, this is way too much for me, I will find another mattress store, you have a good day sir.he responded with yelling good luck as I left your store. Is it really that difficult to buy a mattress in one of your stores? I thought your company was top notch and the absolute best place to go for a mattress. I am not sure of the exact dollar amount I would have spent that day.I am guessing a king size mattress with box spring s and possibly a metal bed frame. somewhere in the ball park between 500.00 to 1,000.00? I do know that your store did not make a sale off of me that day and the reason was the salesperson. You can give him credit though, if his intentions were to completely baffle me, make my head spin with useless information and run me out of your store without spending a dime.he certainly did that with great success.",1
 3 practice bucket before a round of golf? n nSold! n nThank you golfnow.com for a 25 twilight tee time! This was a pleasant surprise. I was not expecting this golf course to be this nice for the price I paid. Beautiful course with desert landscapes between the greens. This course was pretty challenging because i lost a nice handful of golf balls. Of course I'm not that good so I could loose a golf balls on the practice green. n nThe one thing I'd have to say is this place gets mighty chilly once the sun goes down so make sure to bring a jacket otherwise your in for a frigid round.,2
"3x is the charm slide in the resturant, good band, and to top it off, view of the valley as a major thunder lighting storm rolled in! n nIts cliche, its goofy and you drink out of mason jars, but if you are looking for a bit of silly, I really enjoy it I've been for drinks, with the family on a date all times were entertaining the staff is friendly!",2
"My wife and I were very excited about the idea of exotic brats, so we went last month. Over all disapointing. We had the chorizo and Morrocan brats, overpriced at 8 with No Fries, extra 4, very limited menu and no wine offered for Happy Hour reductions. Not everybody drinks hand crafted beers. I agree with Howard Seftel, stay to the traditional 6 brat. Good luck with the concept of a 10 brat with fries. nNot a place i would rush back to!",1
"We were there for our rehearsal dinner prior to our wedding. I usually love Oregano's because it reminds me of home. I have never had a problem until that night. Our pizza came out soggy and half cooked. Then when I returned it after trying to lift up a piece that was soggy after sitting in a puddle of juices and water the manager immediately came over, which at first was nice. It was nice until he accused me that it was my fault the pizza was soggy and sitting in a puddle of juices and water because I ordered a veggie stuffed pizza. The man acted like he and the restaurant had no fault in it at all. I was just shocked. What horrible customer service! When he realized what he had done there was no apology for his behavior until over 30 minutes had gone by and my soon to be husband had spoken with him several times. By then I was in tears because my night not to mention my dinner had been ruined. n I would avoid this location, if you can. I would go to the one off of Shea and Scottsdale Road or on Camelback or any other location. The only thing that gave this place one star was are wonderful and amazing waiter Mike. He was so helpful and so concerned that we had been treated so poorly. I love Oregano's but I will not be returning to this location.",1
"Very good tapas. We went with the Tuna Tartare, Stuffed Dates, Patatas Brevas, Mushroom Tart, Fried Calamari, Grilled Scallops, Albondigas, Ham and Cheese Croquetas, and Serrano Sliders. It was a great meal that my wife and I shared. My favorite was the tuna tartare, my wifes favorite was the mushroom tart. All the food was great, aside from the calamari which was overcooked. The service was great and the staff was all very attentive to our needs. We really wanted to try some dessert but as you can see we went all out for our main meal s. I definitely will come back to this place next time I am in Vegas.",2
"I was in the mood for Panda, so I ran over to pick up some food for dinner. I ordered honey walnut shrimp and shanghai steak along with fried rice. Both items are considered specialty, so there is 1.25 up charge for each item which I am ok with. I am not ok with paying extra and receiving crap. I got there an hour and a half before close, and everything looked ok. The lady said that the food was made recently. Well she lied. The shrimp was luke warm and the breading was mushy. It was literally falling off without me even touching it. The fried rice tasted old. The shanghai steak was ok but the temperature was off for sure. I think it is totally unacceptable to be serving food that is mushy and not fresh. Isn't there some kind of time frame when these items have to be tossed? Do these employees need more training on food safety procedures? Surely the food I was served tonight was not at the proper temperature and not cooked recently. So disappointed.",1

"Whoever named this company was absolutely spot on, because the last 6 phone calls I have made to these people have connected me to giant cockbagdoucheyasshats. n nLets talk about customer service for a minute. more specifically how there is no absolute definition but rather that it is often seen as an activity, performance measurement and a philosophy.

"Out of all the dine in theaters we have in the Phoenix Scottsdale area I do take preference to this one due to price and service. iPic is awesome but extremely overpriced, and the rest are a dud. n nI love having the cinema suites with 21 only to avoid children and crying babies which is often the culprit of a ruined movie experience. The drinks are a little expensive, but I wouldn't expect any less at a dine in theater. I've definitely paid more for a cocktail in Old Town, The food is served in fair portions, but as stated in other reviews the menu is like a Chili's. Their Parmesan fries are ridiculously good! Service is always fast and attentive, staff overall is great. n nWe will be back for other movies!",2
"We ordered the ny style pizza mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, pepperoni with a tomato sauce. It has a thin crust and crunchy. Very delicious and i would come back again! nThe service was great.

I've been there three times, and each time, this has been the slowest restaurant I've been to in the entire city. n nMy guess at why they always look busy is that everyone's been stuck there for two hours, and that tends to keep it full.

"This store is AWESOME! I had a terrible experience at another specialty running store, so when I walked in here I was pretty frustrated and apprehensive, but I couldn't be happier with the level of service I received. They took the time to ask me all kinds of questions about my running style, watched me walk, then had me try several different shoes on the treadmill with the video monitor to show how my feet move. I found a fantastic pair of shoes at a really good price. I will definitely be going back here for all of my running shoes, and will highly recommend them to everyone.",2

"Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over 5 years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. those are usually the best nWhenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different. But not always. nOK. n1. Thai tea. the best in the valley! n2. Pad thai with chicken. level 5 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy. you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and it'll still be just as good. n3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots, pineapple. level 5 again. my fave n4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried. Kind of like a chow fun but better! n nOh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service. n nIf you like Thai, check this place out!",2
"No doubt, this place is definitely poppin'. I've gone to this place a few times now, and every single time, line is out the door. Is it worth the wait? Well that would a for sure ""Yes! "", but I guess you can be the judge of that. n nThis last trip to Vegas, I actually had it twice. One time my friends went and brought the food back to the hotel room. The other was a dine in experience. This review will be based on the dine in experience considering those are the kinds that actually really matter. n nAs mentioned before, line was out the door. They did get a star docked for not making the line move faster. I was hungry, and just the smell of the food was making my tummy do a little grumble mumble. n nFinally ordered and got the Loco Moco and Spam Masubi. Girl like me loves my spam masubi. Spam Seaweed Rice YUM. The Loco Moco was good too. Two runny eggs, hamburger patty, and gravy, all over a bed of rice? Can't really go wrong with that! And who doesn't like using their egg yoke for sauce for their rice? Or maybe that's just a filipino thing! I also tried the soup off my friend's saimin. The small order looks like a large, and could probably feed 2 3 people at least, people who eat like me . The broth was delicious, and I honestly would consider seeing if I can just order the broth next time! n nNote to all first timers, Cash only! Yeah, any place that doesn't accept card is a disadvantage, but the food is just too good to pass up. Not to mention, the prices aren't too bad either!",2

"I came here one night for dinner, and the next day for some desserts since we were too full the night before. n nFirst the service here is not really that great overall. The first night we came here we were sat and placed our order, the person that delivered the entrees took one of our dishes to the wrong table next to us, then he went away to try to figure out where the food went. He took forever and the people at the other table ended up handing our food to us, and finally our waitress came with the rest of the food. We also ordered an appetizer and that did not come out until after the main dishes were almost gone. n nThe second day we came during happy hour and told we had to sit at the bar to get those prices. So we moved to the bar and two bartenders told us they would be right with us, which apparently meant more then 20 minutes, there was very few people in the place at the time too. Finally we got tired of it and went back to our table and skipped the happy hour pricing. I also noticed that two fairly attractive women came to the bar after we went back to our table, they were helped right away and they even finished and left before us. Great to know they value all the customers equally. n nAs far as the food, the regular food was average nothing special, not bad and not great. The desserts were actually pretty good, we had a shake and a waffle banana split. I might consider returning just for the dessert, but on the other hand with so many choices in Vegas especially in the way of food why bother coming back to a place with such bad service.",1

Senor I don't think this even meets health code. n nDinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito. "" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights. n nI like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.",1

I have only been in here once so this may not be a fair review. Came in around 4 PM and asked about happy hour specials and was told they didn't have any. Ordered a Bud Light longneck and they charged me 4. I commented that was pretty steep especially for a bar so far from downtown and was told i should have ordered a draft that it was a better deal. I guess i could have been told that from the beginning but oh well. Nothing exciting about the inside. Just a typical dark smokey bar trying to pass itself off as an Irish pub. I didnt try the food but the menu was typical pub fare with nothing really standing out. I dont see myself ever coming back to even rate it or give it a second chance.,1
"DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE. The employees have no idea what they are talking about, are extremely arrogant and rude. I wanted my computer to be fixed, however was told I spilled liquid on the computer, which is false. I tried to explain I did no such thing. Instead of doing diagnostics on my computer, the employee by the name of Justin, short man, with an elitist attitude, with really dumb mustache tattoo on his finger told me my computer was broken. He quickly assumed there was no hope. This made me extremely upset, afteral, my expensive machine was beyond repair. in his opinion which actually means nothing.I'll get to that soon. I returned to speak with another employee by the name of RT who was extremely helpful and friendly. He told me the issue could be fixed with a replaced battery. Well, the battery was replaced, however it still did not work. I returned to replace my charger. After standing in line, the man in charge of check ins did not take me next, instead chose the man who clearly came after me.can you say, sexist?

"I am very much over ""Tusca "". I first visited here over a year ago and have been here aboout a dozen times since and I've never had a good experience. The only reason I go here is because it is convenient and they have outdoor seating. Yesterday's experience was the impetus to finally document and update my distaste for this place. We get there about 130 PM prior to going to seeing the new mike judge movie. We enter and head towards the bar. It is very muggy inside of this place, how they manage that I just don't know. It's a relatively mild humidity day outside and feels like a costa rican airport inside. There also is an off putting smell to the place that is a cross between some kind of industrial cleaner and something else I can't quite place.maybe the smell of broken dreams. The bartender is so obviously uninterested and apathetic that you can feel the contempt he obviously has for the customers and the disappointment in where he finds himself. I ask for a guinness and they don't have one nor do they suggest a suitable alternative. Annie gets a pretty awful vodka tonic and I settle on a shiraz,maybe the worst glass of wine I've ever had in a restaurant. It was just gross. Annie orders a pizza, which truthfully was edible. I mean it was cheese, marinara and soggy crust. I had the hot tapas steak and fries,which took close to an hour to receive with no apology. The steak was okay, the fries were edible, but again I was so turned off by the atmosphere that even if the food was really good, which it wasn't I wouldn't be back.",1

I walked out without making a purchase. n nI realize it costs money to process card transactions, but just a few cents on small transactions.

And the sad looking girl charged me for drinks when I had money in the machine, which should have been comped cause i was playing. That goes to show how desperate they are for money. n nAll in all I wont be coming back thanks for ruining my neighborhood bar by firing all the dope bartenders for your wack a wife to bartender who sucks and is too busy flirting with the customers over pool to serve us. n nYall ruined a good neighborhood bar!

"How good this place is really depends when you go I've had some great nights here but these have been balanced out by some really awful ones! n nWhat's great about WhistleBinkies is that it's the only place in Edinburgh I know that has live music on every night. However this music is different every day, so you could get everything from traditional scottish folk through to ska through to heavy metal. My advice would be to do your homework check their website to see who's playing every day, or play it safe and go on a monday for their Open Mic night. n nWhat's bad about it is the drinks prices. You can expect to pay u00a33.50 u00a35.50 per drink, which would be ok if there was ever anywhere to sit. Although the quirky alcoves, various nooks and crannies, sofas and upturned barrels for tables do give the place a certain rustic charm, there are simply not enough of them. n nIf live music is the most important thing for your night out, this is probably your place. If you want loo roll in the bathrooms, ice in your drinks and somewhere to sit. then it's probably not.",1

I'm a bit unnerved when the original issue I came in for is not addressed by the doctor and instead I am herded into other treatments. I get a little frustrated when I have to jump through hoops to get a refill on my sublingual meds. I get upset when I get charged a co pay for a ""check in "" visit for the previously mentioned at home self administered medication every 3 months. I get angry when I am charged a 100 fee for rescheduling an appointment. Had I been dishonest regarding my situation and kept the appointment instead of informing the office who did not mention the fee during the reschedule , I would have only been charged my normal co pay. However, I get REALLY angry when I am condescended to by the staff. I agree with the other reviewers regarding the staff being snippy, unaccommodating, argumentative and downright RUDE. They will not listen to explanations, instead they will site ""notes "" that were written by their incompetent co workers.

"It's places like these that make me realize Yelp is full shit. I've been here twice, first I went vegetarian simply because I don't trust the meat at a lot of places, I got a rice bowl, with beans, some weird mushroom mixture, rice, salsa and lettuce. It was flavorless and stomach churning. Got chips and guacamole, again flavorless. I decided, it's just another shitty mexican joint that I will drive past and ignore, like most. n nA couple months go by, I hear they are opening multiple locations, I decided I must have missed something, so I went back for lunch this last weekend. My wife and I got 2 Street corn on the cobs with ""butter "", chili powder and lime. Butter has quotes around it cause what they use, that shit is not butter. I got a pastor burrito and my wife got a rice bowl. We also got chips and guacamole and I got a coke. n nFirst, the corn was forgettable, makes you appreciate the dude selling it on the street. My burrito was God awful, the pork tastes like it's seasoned with kool aid packets, I took 2 bite and lost 100 of my appetite. One of the worst meals I had ever had. Chips were stale and guacamole taste like it was left over from last time I was there. No salsa bar. My wife's bowl was nothing more than OK. My coke was spectacular. n nAs I said, my food was terrible, but also, their ordering system is terrible, welcome to America, learn our procedures. With a normal ordering system you might be able to cut down on the 3 extra employees standing around checking their Facebook. n nDid I mention the temperature, oh ya, it was unbelievable hot in the dining area, my wife actually stood up and lowered the thermostat, it didn't help. We both left dripping with sweat and our clothes stretched out, my wife considered taking her pants off for the ride home to air out. It was disgusting. The temperature, not my wife taking her pants off. n nLastly, this place clearly has a corrupted Yelp, don't believe any of the reviews. I wish you could give zero stars.",1
"Carnevino is a fabulous albeit really expensive meal, especially if you make some good selections. My brother the hard core foodie knew that the best steak, the reservo, is not on the menu. It had been hanging since late June almost nine months , and our server Jim did a fabulous job of explaining the taste profile. He also suggested pairing it with a more traditional cut, both to provide a contrast and to cut the gamey taste of the older meat. For my two cents, the old stuff is great and has an element of ham in its taste.but that's just me. The appetizers and sides were fine but utterly uneventful, though the steak tartar was a touch better than that. Our first round of cocktails was solid but nothing special, but after the first round the bartender, Cooper, came to check up on us. He offered to make me something off menu if I gave him a taste profile. He came back with an A concoction of amaro, orange bitters, orange vodka, ginger, and lemon. Highly recommended! n nMy only complaint would be about pacing. For 200 person, I expect pacing for a 2 hour meal. As the appetizers were coming, I expressed this concern to Jim, and a 2 hour meal did, in fact, occur. Without intervention, though, I'm guessing 1 hr 15 30 minutes, which is too quick for a restaurant of this caliber.",2
"Wow, this was the WORST stay at the Homewood Suites that we've ever had! n nWe have stayed, and recommend staying at other Homewood suite locations from San Diego to Bakersfield, we even had a family reunion at another location. But THIS location FAIL. n nWe checked in about 11pm after having reserved the room via telephone the week prior. We explicitly requested a ONE BEDROOM suite, as we had our children with us. Upon checking in, of course as hotel staff's default statement goes, ""Sorry, we had you booked with a ""suite "" and not a one bedroom suite, and we are all booked "" Right. Of course the consumer knows this means ""screw you, we gave your room away to someone that got here with the loot earlier.

Oh, by the way, this isn't the first time we've stayed at the Homewood Suites, so come up with something better than that! n nLong story short, we found the room to appear like a ""Crash Pad "" for God knows who? maybe employees?

We ended up calling them 5 times that night to remedy all the issues including the heating system.

I successfully avoided the ""join the masssage club "" sales pitch and checked out. Walked next store to grab some vitamens and realized I did not have my phone. Walked back over to Massage Envy and let the receptionists know I left it in the room. They were very quick to tell me that the next appt was already checked in and that I could wait.and, oh by the way, the appt was a 90 min massage. I was not planning on barging into the room and interrupting the massage .but I told them exactly where I left my phone. They wouldn't budge. I left and called back 90 min later and they told me that the phone wasn't in there. Go figure. I have no idea what happened to it stolen, tossed in the trash, etc . But it's gone. So.my free massage is going to cost me 200 in a new cell phone. They do not have personal lockers.so be sure you have all of your belongings when you leave.as you will be SOL if you've left something behind.wallet, keys, jewlery, etc.",1
"It's now "" 3.49 Cleaners "". They do a decent job but I finally realized they're the ones stapling the return ticket to the garment itself. And I don't like little holes appearing on the fronts of my dress shirts.",1
Went on a wednesday at 2 30 pm and I was the only person in line. 3 cars were there when I left. This is the place to go. I went to the N. Scottsdale location the day before and all 4 bays had at least 7 cars in line. I turned around left. Go to the washington location.,2

"It's funny how much people love this place now. considering the battle and war it took to get this thing built. The arena went up without voter consent and boy am I glad it did. n nI've been to a wide range of events here. Concerts, Checkers, Bobcats, major tournaments, the circus. Always fun and there's not really a bad seat in the place. n nThe new craft beer garden is an awesome addition this year. It features local brews. I waited in line for a long time the other night at Pearl Jam, but it was worth it. Pricing is just a little bit more than your concession stand Bud Miller Coors. n nOne of my favorite things about TWC Arena is what it does for our local businesses. I saw this first hand as a bartender moment of silence for Dixie's Tavern . The amount of people each event brings to uptown is a welcome sight for any business owner and worker. We were on a mission to grab food before Pearl Jam. Every restaurant was packed. packed on a Wednesday night when normally there would be little to no one out. n nParking advice if you plan on pre or post event drinks or food. go somewhere that validates parking. It will save you big time. The decks and lots can charge 10 or more. Fitzgerald's is the closest to the arena. It validates the Wake Forest garage next to it. Queen City Q validates for 7th Street Station. A few blocks down. Cowbell validates the Fifth Third deck.",2
"THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED! nGo to the one on 68th St. Thomas. Well its actually inbetween Thomas and Osborn on the west side of 68th street. nHidden, yes, but this is the last Tacos Jalisco standing and their food will blow your brain to the wall. nDont judge it by its shitty appearance.",1
"I went to Von's only to get a gallon of milk. I detest this store. Oh, it's clean and the employees are friendly. But they have nothing and the produce is awful and expensive. n nNo supermarket here is as good as the worst ones back east, but Von's is my least favorite. It's the closest to my house, though, so I'm usually passing by when I need milk or tuna salad. n nEven the parking lot sucks!",1
"I called to make an appointment and have been apprehensive for months today because I couldn't take the pain in my back anymore. I had an AWFUL experience at massage envy a while back and wouldn't ever go back there. They said they could take me today, and I went over about an hour later. I filled out the packet and was taken into the room right away. I must note that in the form I filled out it asked if I liked chit chat, or silence, if I liked light medium or heavy pressure, if I liked music or silence, etc. Please explain to me why this guy talked non stop he was nice though and put so much pressure on me that I was brought to tears. Do they ever READ these forms? Ugh. I pre paid up front for an hour and a half, but wanted it to be over so badly that I said he could just do an hour and then keep the rest as his tip. Do I think he deserved a 20 tip? No way. But did I want it over with so bad that I was willing to forego 30 minutes to get the hell out of there? Yes! I do not like massages that cause pain. This guy was telling me it is supposed to hurt. What?! If I have a kink somewhere, I'd rather it take 5 sessions with you being gentle, than trying to force it out in one session. It has been 4 hours now, and I still can not sit down. I work from home and design all day. I am staring at a computer and unknowingly at times do not sit properly which I am sure is causing the pain. However, I can afford to come back more than once. Like I said. They guy seemed nice, and I was glad they took me right away well I suppose until I started crying . Because the guy I had specializes in injuries, so I'm sure it's hard for him not to force pressure. I will go back again, this time making an appointment for someone who focuses on therapeutic massages and re review. But for now, my 2 stars stand. Like me. Who can't sit. ",1
"So most of us do not like dealing with Car dealerships, and I normally always call the internet department as you seem to get better service and are not subjected to the salesperson who swoops in as you walk from parking your car! n nWe were in the final stage of deciding WHICH car my wife wanted and wanted to test drive one last model as she had a day off and we were running Errands. We stopped to test drive one more model and decided that was the one. We were working with another dealership, but they had very little stock. n nSo before we walked out the door, they asked what they could do, with very low pressure. We told them and they surprised us by responding positively. nAfter some back and forth, we ended up getting that car that day they had one in the color we wanted with just 4 miles on it . n nSo not a bad experience! Ask for Daisha Doolittle. Not only is she a salesperson, she actually is a Mazda zealot! LOL!",2
"I really don't get all of the 5 star reviews. This place has good food but their prices are astronomical. I had a 35 dollar lunch with my son. I had a lamb shank and he had a chicken wrap and we had some hummus. n nThe lamb was good but very puny as far the meat goes. So if 17 lunches per person are in your comfort zone, then party on!",1
"Only giving some stars because they actually changed my oil without problems. n nBut the experience was not good! I asked for my brakes to be checked. When they were done with my oil, they started to send me out on my way until I asked about my brakes. I overheard the attendant ask the tech about my brakes and he replied ""Oh sh t I forgot! Tell her she needs her front brakes replaced "". I walked out ! ! ! Take note that I had just had the front brake pads replaced just 3 months prior, but it was my rear brakes that were almost shot. I had SunCare Auto fix them for me at a great deal. If I had minded Purrfect, I would have had new brakes replaced again and the rear brakes would have never been taken care of and God knows what could have happened then. n nI can understand an honest mistake, but to blatantly LIE about something as they did, and possibly cause me more problems down the road. they don't deserve to be in business",1
"I live for Thriftys ice cream! From double malt crunch to black cherry and yes the occasional bubble gum or pecan praline. n nAnd I love a good cookie sandwich, a good chocolate chip cookie stuffed with Vanilla ice cream from the ice cream truck was always my first pick. But I'm sad to say that the cookies here are not for me. they are really tasty and good quality cookies but there not good cookies for an ice cream sandwich. n nThere to soft, to chewy for a cookie sandwich, when you bite in to them they just crumble and smush into the ice cream. theres no foundation, it would help if they froze the cookies first or uses a batter that made them less soft.",1

"Marianne does a great job with Brazilians. She is located with in the Satsum Wellness center and has her own specific room there. She does a great job of making you feel comfortable while she's ripping the hair out. If you've never had one than I won't lie. it does hurt. I can tell you that Marianne does her best to ensure that she doesn't cause too much pain and talks you through the process. She uses different waxes and uses a more sensitive wax for the more delicate areas. She does her best to make sure that she gets every last hair. Great job, clean shop and a good experience. I will definitely go back to her! Cost is average at about 65 plus tip. n nOne last note. it is very easy to book appointments with Marianne. She takes appointment online via her website and is very accommodating. Also works Sundays and is open late.",2
Disappointed to order carne asada nachos to get home with no carne asada. I'm not sure how it happened when there were six people working and I was the only customer! This location is the same distance as the one on rainbow so that's where I'll be going from now on.,1
"Cool place. Hit or miss on the food. We had some duck that was off the charts good and some risotto that was horrible. I've literally never had bad risotto before, but this was completely tasteless.

We went on a whim for my wife's 40th birthday with friends. Coolest dive bar I've been to since San Diego. Owner is one of the female bartenders. Staff was friendly and all the patrons were from a different walk of life and everyone was welcoming like they were all family and everyone belonged there. They have this thing with Pabst Blue Ribbon bottles where if you guess the correct suit under the cap you get that bottle free! They have karaoke and pool tables!,2

"Came here last week me and the BF craving custard and Italian Ice. The location is nice and convenient, service was great everyone was nice, but the Italian Ice was way too sweet and same with the custard we had only a couple bites and threw it out. Kind of waste of money. I wanted to enjoy it ",1

First and last time coming here. nUncle lives just up the street so I figured we stop by for some tacos. Food was okay. No complaints there. Now the cashier taking our order was absolutely rude. I'm sorry if you dislike your job but don't take your frustration out on others .,1
"This place is a great place to cool off and people watch. Fantastic idea, really. Who else serves jungle juice by the pitcher? My problem came when I tabbed out and got the wrong card back. Lots of cards back there fine, but when I got mine back it had a guys name on it. I was fine with that, both our last names started with the same letter and it was the same blue card. I was fine with not only them thinking I was a guy, but also giving me then wrong one. It happens. But when I pointed it out that it was not me they claimed to give me my card back. Really? But the card in my bill is not me. The were still positive they gave me my card back. Finally I gave up and they told me to call back later to see if my card was returned. If you gave me my card back, why would I return it, I'm so confused? Blah, blah, they didn't give or even a ""hey we are sorry "". Which stinks. I would suggest going, but would just not pay buy card!",1
"Horrible dark dirty place, bad service, totally in authentic food. Anyone who thinks this is good Med food was born, raised and lived in Apache Junction their entire life",1
"I've had multiple things repaired here when desperate. Once was a dress that just needed the unfinished hem cut, which she took on in a hurry and did a decent job with. She did fine with having jeans hemmed shorter too. Another time I gave her an expensive winter coat to have the sleeves shortened, and I got the coat back with the sleeves so short it's laughable. I don't blame her for the shoddy job as clearly I should have complained when it happened, but I definitely won't take anything back here that is expensive.",1
"They've been here less than 2 years and have raised most prices of their spirits by 2 4 dollars in this brief period. In this economy and with gas prices falling, they must be insane!",1
"This place can be summed up in one word awful. In a search to find a good sushi spot in Las Vegas, I came upon Sumo. Walking in, I took a look at the menu and decided to give it a shot. Looking at the AYCE menu, I decided to go with a la carte. Thank god I did. n nOrdering a few simple rolls, they came out promptly but were warm and soggy the opposite of fresh. All rolls were chewy should have ordered soy paper for the extra charge and the Philly roll had enough cream cheese to choke a horse. Add to this the fact that the waters came out in dirty glasses with no ice and that gives a full snapshot of the meal. n nOnce I stomach down a few pieces, I looked down to find my napkin and unfortunately saw the sides of the ""white "" table cloth. These resembled a scene out of CSI. n nImmediately asking for the check, we walked out with no intent on returning and very thankful we steered clear of the AYCE option. The only reason this review has 2 stars is because the staff is very friendly, constantly smiling and always prompt when refilling our tap water.",1
"Haha.just got a call from Lifetime asking me if I want to reactivate my membership with their ""special "" offer.um, NO, thank you!",1
"I like Rhumbar, tasty drinks, nice waitstaff, good music and a phenomenal location.unfortunately I won't go back. They have started charging a 3.75 CSF, a fee for no reason other than to make more money. Our waitress told us it was called a Concession Service Fee, and that it was a way for them to make more money without raising their drink prices. This fee is ridiculous! The CSF wasn't even listed on our menu, it just showed up on our final bill. Charge me what the drink cost and don't tack on a fee at the end. I'm more than willing to pay the current cost of the drink and would even pay a dollar more, their prices are competitive with other speciality bars on the strip. In all fairness, we did a little investigating and after looking through a couple of menus we found one with the fee list, also our fee was waived when we asked to speak with the manager he never talked to us just told the waitress to take it off the bill . I would love to go back to Rhumbar but until they get rid of the fee I won't be back. Lesson for anybody that does choose to go to Rhumbar, asked to speak with a manager about the CSF and they will waive it rather than have to justify their shoddy business practices to you.",1
"Imperial Garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years. The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low. n nBut none of these things can save the mediocre to bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take out. I now double check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet and sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart loves the three delicacies sizzling rice. n nI did discover one saving grace if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead.",1
"This is my favorite place to go to get caffeined up before going to Church in Henderson. Ridiculously low price unlike the other chain coffee shops we see everywhere.

"Yelp 100 Challenge 62 100 n nOur art teacher had our class meet here on Friday to do some landscape drawing. When we got to the gardens, I was instantly drawn to the cute chickadees hopping from tree to tree and the buff lizards that liked to do push ups. So much so that I was so ready to just let go of the sketchbook and do some exploration. But of course, we had to pick a spot and draw away. n nSoon enough, I guess all of us agreed that spending our 6 hour art class solely to draw wasn't going to happen. Our professor joined us for a nice picnic and we proceeded to check out the fruit trees that surrounded our bench namely peach trees and grape vines. There were rose bushes, daisies and fig trees as well. We felt like little kids, scuttling all over the place and chasing lizards. n nIn the afternoon, it started to get hot and our professor had class dismissed by about 1pm. My galpal and I didn't get enough of the place earlier and decided to stay and check out what else was there. We headed for the gallery where there were interactive areas to learn about green living, energy and water conservation. Mind you, all these were free. Getting to the museums would cost you about 9 for residents and 8 for students. If you'd like to save up on the cash, take the family and the kids to the gift shop library or the nature exchange, where, according to the website, the nature exchange program is based on the concept ""trading items found in nature, which encourages curiosity, discovery and respect of the natural world. Visitors collect, preserve and research items found in nature, from which they earn points based on the item's condition, size and rarity. Best of all, they can earn points for the information they share, either verbally or in the form of reports, journals or photographs. "" n nWe have yet to try out the cafe or slip in on events but I'm seeing to it that it will happen soon. Honestly, I was a surprised why it took me 4 whole years before I came here. Gardeners and nature lovers alike will adore this place, no doubt.",2
"Personally, I didn't like it. It's considered the number 2 steakhouse in Vegas. I ordered the ribeye and shared sides with our party creamed spinach, mushrooms and mac and cheese. Honestly, none of it was memorable. Felt that the steak was too heavy and lacking flavor. I didn't even finish an eighth of my steak. ",1
"I never find myself in Mesa, strictly out of principle D, but I was headed to the Mesa Arts Center for a concert and found this gem using my Yelp app. n nThe waitress was very attentive and actually apologized for asking me a question right after I took a bite I swear they must teach that timing in the training videos at every restaurant . I had the El Capitan the Cubana empanadas as part of the platter for dinner. Both were excellent. There was a surprisingly decent assortment of craft beer bottles to choose from as well. I was easily convinced to look at the sweet empanadas for dessert, and the waitress was quick to point out all her favorites essentially the whole menu . I settled on the Ruiz's Pieces, because obviously I'm a sucker for a clever name. n nI suppose I'll have to find an excuse to be in Mesa again soon. It will be an easy walk from the light rail as well once it's finished being built out that far.",2

"I see a theme here. They completely mess up, then send someone ELSE back to fix the problem. I was told that I would receive a call before the tech's arrival. I did not. When the tech finally arrived, late, I asked him to wait 5 minutes while I finished a phone call. The Tech was aggressive, refused to wait. After I agreed to open the garage door the tech insisted that I move the vehicle there in. I said that I would. About a minute later the Tech knocked loudly on my inner garage door. As I answered the Tech became belligerent angry when I informed him that I needed 3 more minutes on the phone. The Tech very rudely informed me that my request for a few minutes was unacceptable. I asked the Tech to leave. The tech approached me, I began to shut the garage door, he stopped, turned around began to pick up his tools stating that I would still be billed. I told the Tech that there was no way that I would pay for this. He left. Good thing I didn't have to shoot him. My experience on the phone with them wasn't so great either. RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! even if the owners or have some good employee s , the fact that they would hire such a person speaks volumes.

"As a travel agent, I was completely appalled at how they handled one of my clients booking for a Grand Canyon Tour. Firstly they couldn't find his reservation that I had made when he called to reconfirm 24hrs prior. After I called and gave a little bit of hell the agent proceeded to tell me the tour was booked for the date that I booked my client on and that he would have to change his dates! Hello! My client was only in Vegas for 2 nights! nAll and all, after going back with Showtime tours, the agent there pretty much told me the tours were cancelled and my client was screwed SO I told them to cancel and process a refund, in which the agent said ""FINE "" and hung up on me. nNeedless to say, teh next 4 Grand Canyon Tours I've booked all have gone to another local company. n nI would give them ZERO stars if I could but STAY away from Showtime Tours they are not worth the time.",1

The server saw us, as he was sucking up to the table next to us. I asked if he was supposed to be our server he was , and if he knew we had been sitting there for nearly 10 minutes he didn't . n nBears has always been good, so I thought maybe this Jimmy Fallon wannabe was just an oblivious d bag. So, I called the restaurant after we left.

"Just got done hiking toms thumb trail a few hours ago for the first time. So beautiful, but challenging! Takes around two hours for the whole thing round trip, but definitely rewarding once you get to the top. Clearly marked trails, which was nice too.

Being one of the very few reptile stores on the west side of town, it's not bad, but the reptile experience and the customer service experience that I have had both times are lacking the luster that I can get from even Petsmart. For being only a short drive away from Exotic Predators and Prey, I would spend the extra bit of gas.",1
"The price has gone up to 4 for six pieces and they only take cash. It is also easy to pass by, my husband and I searched for a while before we realized we had passed it up. But that is where my whining ends, the process they use to make the candy is so fascinating and unique, and it really is so delicious! I love how the outer coating melts in your mouth and the inside is so chewy. My husband hit the nail on the head when he said they taste like aba zabas but really fresh ones . They also sell boba there, we didn't try it though.",2
"I've stayed at this resort twice. My visits were in April of 2012 and April of 2013. The Links Resort is a nice, clean, quiet place with a condo type atmosphere. The rooms are nicely appointed with modern flat screen tv's in the living room and master bedroom. Both units I stayed in had full kitchens and accessories to do your own cooking if you wanted. nThere are 2 pools. One is their Tranquility pool which is the smaller, more private of the two. The large pool is huge. Plenty of lounge chairs, tables, and cabanas. There is also a very large hot tub, and a neat water fountain feature for the kids. The restrooms in the pool area are big, clean, and modern as well. nThe reception area is staffed 24 hours a day and has fresh coffee on hand that is free for guests who stay there. There is a handy mini conveinient store inside the reception area that sells beer, soda, milk, juice, snacks, water, and some basic household necessities. nThis place is a timeshare and we ran into many ""owners "" who were very friendly and didn't seem to be bothered by us ""renting "" for the weekend. The resort staff were extremely polite and efficient. The rates are comparable to a stay at nearby hotels which makes the Links Resort an even better value. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Scottsdale near the Airport or West World Event Center. I noticed that my phone connected automatically to the Wifi at the resort without having to do anything. I use AT T so perhaps they have a new system.not sure.",2

"This restaurant by far has the worst service I have ever experienced! I will NEVER go back! Not only do they have bad service, but their manager and owner failed to even see the problem that an hour and a half wait time to receive our food was. The manager and owner were very rude, disrespectful, condescending, and unprofessional. They proceeded to tell our party that they accommodated us in seating our party of 12 because we took up table space in their patio. Not only this, but after hearing our complaints of our service the manager said that we had great service that our food only took 45 mins to get to our table. Basically calling all 12 of us liars. I cannot give this place a bad enough review. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially if you are visiting Chandler. If you go despite this review with a group larger than 8, make sure that you all take cash. They have a restaurant policy that they will NOT divide up the check, and you can only pay with one credit card or with cash. Apparently this policy is written in fine print on their menu. Therefore, the server did not disclose this information to our party. When it came time to pay we all had credit cards. It took us over 2 hours to speak with management and the owner about these issues. Nothing was resolved. In the end the server separated our bill and the manager and owner acted as though they did us a favor. Again I CANNOT give this restaurant a low enough rating! n nEl Zocalo is El Suckalo!",1
"Seeing as how I was staying at PH it was only right I came here. Granted I didn't dine here, but I sure did use the walk up bar to get some yummy drinks. I got a mix, of what I really dont remember because I drank so much out there, lol, but it was strawberry and reg margaritas i think mixed in the tall 12 dollar glass. With an extra shot of course. Yes. I know. 12 bucks. for a drink. a few more bucks for a shot. How stupid, right? Wrong. I'm an out of towner, typical tourist, taking in the sights and Cabo Wabo was actually one of my fav places to drink on the strip. Prob because of the convenience of coming downstairs in the middle of the night getting an alcoholic beverage. Either way, by the time my week long vegas trip was over I brought home about a good 4 Cabo Wabo cups. Looking forward to doing it all over again when I come back in October. I'll give a better review then since my Vegas cherry has been popped.",2
"How do you say ""this place sucks "" in Spanish? ""Muy mala "" seems too nice. First, their service is all about sales. ""Want to start with our most overpriced and unsatisfying menu items? Because if not we'll judge you. "" That sort of thing. I did enjoy the well margarita, but for 9 more than five sips over ice would be nice. n nAnd the food. Puta madre. La comida was beyond bad. It is actually MEAN to serve food this dull and charge this much for it. The carnita tacos were dry, flavorless, and lazy. The mole was a one note paste over dry chicken enchiladas. Both astoundingly overpriced. Funny how often fancy Mexican places make you nostalgic for cheap ones. This place is all style, no substance.",1
"Excellent spot in great area! The Food was very good and the prices were moderate. Service was good as well. Try to Fried Chicken Breast entree, delicious. Hanger Steak left a little to be desired though, but overall good choice. I would recommend.",2
"My mom and I decided to stay at the Valley Ho while we were in town for a quick trip to AZ for a birthday party. We loved our hotel room and overall we had great experience. I called to see if they had any extra blankets and guest services said they would check and have someone drop it off or call us back to let us know. n nI used my card to hold the reservation however, my mom was the person paying the bill. I checked in without my mom and the next day I was informed I need to submit full payment for the room asap. My mom was paying but wasn't going to be around Scottsdale until later that evening.we were there for a bday party so, they ran my card for partial payment after telling me they couldn't and wouldn't do this because payment had to be submitted in full . When we arrived later that evening we were locked out of our room and had to go to the front desk to submit full payment. The partial payment is still pending on my account 2 days later. n nOther than that, the room was spacious and I loved the soaking tub, separate shower and large vanity so there was plenty of space to get ready. We didn't really get to check out the amenities because we weren't in our hotel too much however, we stopped by the pool on our last day and it was busy but not too crowded. The music was great and the waitresses were very friendly. Perfect location.close to airport,short drive to Fashion Square and walking distance to boutiques and restaurants.",2
I went when they first opened and did not like it. i had a crepe with spinach and goat cheese it was super bland and not good. we also had the mussels and they were just ok. I will say that there sandwiches looked great and if I find myself over there I will try it again,1

"My family stayed the TI for the New Year. We first tried the buffet and everyone seemed to be satisfied. The next day, we decided to follow the crowd and tried the Coffee Shop at the hotel. What's a disaster! We were seated fairly quickly. My wife ordered a club sandwich, seared Salmon for daughter, pasta for the boy and Pho for me. I took more than 30 minutes for the foods to make it to our table. After a long day on the strip, we were ready to eat. However, the foods were awful. The best thing was the Pho I ordered but it was definitely the worst PHO I had ever had. Club sandwich was cold like it was made in the morning with soggy fries, pasta like it came out of canned food, salmon and Pho were tasteless. The final straw was the bill for 80 plus tip. Take my advice, save your money and have real food elsewhere. You'll thank me for that.",1

"Do not waste your money! n nWe purchased a Groupon for this ice cream, thankfully! It was just terrible. We had never been before, but love Cold Stone so we thought we'd try it since we were in the area. The ice cream looked old, and after trying it, tasted like nothing. n nIt is also very expensive 4.99 for a small . Above all, it was incredibly dirty in there! Both restrooms and the drinking fountain were out of order. n nWe will not be back. Not even worth a Groupon! ",1
"The best buffet in Vegas hands down! On the weekends it costs about 30, but this last time I went it was 2 for 1 if you have a Rewards Card. and you better believe I brought mine! Wooohoooo! n nThey have a nice selection to choose from and the quality of the food is top notch. Some of my favorite dishes there are the tri tip steak, prime rib, fried chicken, kalua pig, lomi salmon, and kalbi ribs. Trust me when I say everything is good! They also have crab legs that are piled up pretty high and never seem to run out. I don't like crab, but if you do then you'll be in heaven! n nThey also have an all you can drink beer and wine station as well as a pretty good dessert station across from it. At the dessert place they got a good sized gelato selection. I usually get the oreo or vanilla. n nWhen ever I am in Vegas it is a must for me and my group to eat at a buffet, and Studio B Buffet is the winner! Winner, winner, chicken dinner!",2
"The apartments themselves, as far as the one i am in is ok. When i moved in there were problems with 3 faucets malfunctioning. That was three months ago. I am now getting them fixed. Shortly after moving in i had a leak under kitchen sinked that water logged everythng i had stored including an electric appliance. The communication between management and maintenance is horrible. Setting up an appointment to get a repair is a bit of a fiasco. No one wants to take blame for miscommunication. I was just told on the phone that maintenance is on there way, 25 minutes later, i walk to the office and no one knows what i am talking about. Other poor communication such as me stating to management, ""tell maintenance to go in i am leaving so they can get the job done without my dog barking during the whole repair "". I come back two hours later figuring they would be finished. No one came in because i normally do not let them in. But specific instructions were given to tell them to go in. I watched the maintenance crew walk out the front door as i was pulling in to complex. So i knew they were right there with management. I really cannot belive that i can speak with someone and give specific instructions, walk away and it is as if the conversation never happened. To be fair to maintenance i do not believe it is there fault. It is there office staff and there are only two that i know of. I get upset after waiting to get a repair and due to miscommunication, i am asked when a good time to fix the repair is? The only real answer without wasting more time is ""right now "". I moved here because they allow large breed dogs. I can honestly say i am sorry i moved here, but hoping it will get better. The grounds are well kept and clean for having dogs everywhere. I probably would not have written this review but this last incident took me over the top and felt like these people do not take customer concerns seriously enough. Overall if you are desperate for a place that allows large breed dogs, you could try, but i would not pick this place if i had it to do over. It is just difficult finding places on the westside that allow large breeds.",1
"I had the most horrible service possible! The drive thru person Brandon was so rude! After each item I ordered he asked "" is that it "" you never say that ask if my order is complete or suggest something. Then he didn't verify my order on screen. The total on screen showed 10.78 to pay I get to the window and was asked to pay 13.36?! I am pretty sure that is why you are supposed to verify the order! I didn't get a thank you or come again my food was shoved in my face and then he shut the window! I will not return to this jack because of this or any for that matter. Rude employees should be dealt with if I am a bother to you then find another job don't work in the industry that requires hospitality!",1
"I've previously been a customer of Anna's Alterations in University City, but as I don't need go to that part of town anymore it was time I tried the location closer to home. I'd ordered some clothes online and while the paints were the correct inseam they sold all their paints the same length. So in I walked with 4 pairs of paints, a shirt, and the pair of shoes I intended to wear with them all. n nOne of the clerks showed me to the small stable of dressing rooms they have and I got changed. We talked about how much break to have to the jeans and the seamtress, rolled and pinned my paints accordingly. As all the pants were the same length I expected to try one pair and they would mark them all the same. Such was their attention to detail that they had me try on each pair of jeans and slacks even the ones that were the same style from teh same manufacturer in different colors so that they were all properly marked to be hemmed. Having the shirt tailored was easy exprience, just pull it on, stand in front of the mirrors and ask the seamtress to take in the shape so the shirt fit more V shaped. n nThe only reason I hold back a star is their no display of prices for services. I walked in with my clothes, said what I needed done, and once all the adjustments were marked, was handed a ticket to come back in a week it was mid June they were busy . When I came back with a claim ticket they just told me how much to pay, so I have no idea what I paid for each service or how that compares to others.",2
Definitely one of our favorite lunch places. We have not had a lunch that we haven't really liked. This is turning into one of our regular spots.,2
"I've had a soft spot for Lava Lounge for years. It's a great bar club that's a bit off beat. The punk alternative crowd dominates the clientele here, but anyone outside of that demographic need not feel intimidated. I've been here in ratty jeans and a t shirt as well as in business casual attire and was treated the same. If you want to just drink and or spend your time however you please then you'll be treated fairly it's a pretty cool crowd. Thumbs down for the smoking.",2
"I wondered for a year if this place would ever get up to speed. It seemed like the conversion from Cub Foods to Metcalfe's took forever and every time I went, I left disappointed because it wasn't even close to the fabulousness that is their Hilldale store . n nWell, glory hallelujah it's finally finished! It's much larger than the Hilldale store in fact, it feels almost cavernous by comparison. But that's not a dig there's nothing I hate more than an overcrowded grocery store. The lighting is interesting spotlit in the fresh food areas and deli, with standard overhead lighting in the supermarket aisles. n nNow, I have to say, I haven't done a ""full shop "" at Metcalfe's and probably won't. Their prices on standard grocery items are MUCH higher than those at other stores in the area Woodman's, most notably . But frankly, I don't think that's why one shops at Metcalfe's. It's for the lovely produce, great bakery and top notch specialty items, as well as the terrific deli and ready to eat foods soups, salad bar, etc . One of my very favorite things is that they always have chopped or shredded rotisserie chicken on their salad bar. Sometimes I by pass the salad and just get a container of chicken a welcome short cut to a homemade frittata, risotto, or gumbo. Of course, I probably shouldn't have mentioned that because now everybody will do as I do, leaving me SOL when I need chicken. n nIn fact, I've developed a little Sunday ritual grabbing a latte at a nearby coffee shop, then stopping into Metcalfe's for a little ""coffee and "" from their wonderful selection of local, artisanal pastries. It's a lovely moment of tranquility before I dive back into the work week.",2

"This place used to be really good, but I don't know what happened. The staff didn't even know what I meant when I ordered a tekka maki. When the rolls finally came out, they were horrible. The tekka maki looked like crap although the fish quality was ok and was served on an old, dirty looking plate. The eel on the dragon roll had a bad texture, and the roll itself had an unappealing taste. The only positive thing that happened was that our server was nice and kept checking on us. I'll never come back here again. Sticking to sushimon.",1
"I can't seem to order anything but the matzo ball chicken soup.I try and try to order something different but end up getting the same thing!

The matzo ball soup has always been great, but sometimes two or three times out of the many times I have eaten there the soup tastes old and the matzo is mushy. Most of the time it's great. Maybe because I usually go late in the day.I sometimes find myself scared to eat there after lunch as I hate the taste of old chicken. I do love lunch there.",2
"What a ride! Looking for something to do one morning in Vegas, we considered Hoover dam, zip lines, dune buggies, and then the idea of a Segway tour came up.

That was the biggest lie ever. We didn't get seated for an hour and a half. The manager, who did offer to pay for drinks and appetizers, was rude and insulting the whole time. He even squelched on paying for the drinks. This is not the place to go if you don't want to wait outside forever. The worst part is there was no handicap parking and my husband had to walk a long way to the restaurant. The hostesses kept telling us ten minutes, but it was obvious they didn't care if we sat or not. The food was adequate. It took us a half an hour to get breadsticks because they didn't have any ready. Overall, I would never go back to this location.",1

But, the fast part for this location has struggled for a while. I mainly visit this location for weekday work time lunch breaks 12 or 1 pm. n nMaybe I should give them some slack because most places are slammed around this same time, but I feel they could step it up a bit and decrease the wait time a little. n nAlthough, I do really have zero complaints on the food. After all it is Taco Bell.",1
"Yuck. First, the fish was stale and definitely not safe. Second, both sushi chefs were SO drunk they couldn't keep it together.

The gobs of different cheeses that they use are just too delicious. Pepperoni and sausage is a close second! They use thick slices of sausage that just complement the rich tomato sauce perfectly. Their crust is chewy and crispy at the same damn time. n nIf you come here you have to order an entire pizza regardless of how many people are in your party. Nothing beats a freshly baked pizza! Just be careful to wait a second so you don't burn the roof of your mouth. n nNow excuse me while I go reheat a leftover slice of white pizza in my kitchen.",2
I think this is named Cambridge Cleaners now. And it is 2.50 an item. But.having been a dry cleaners daughter I am not impressed. At all. Yes.you get what you pay for but they are not able to get a simple salad dressing spot out of my husband's polo shirts. It has not been washed or thrown in the dryer which sets stains. It is not laundered it is supposedly pre spotted and then dry cleaned. 5 of the 7 had to be returned. I know it can come out. I have taken the very same shirts to another cleaners and voila not a problem. SO why can't they get it out? I do not recommend and I won't go back.,1

Had a god experience dining here food was good and service was pleasant,2
"Fantastic sweet pastries and crepes! I think that's how you translate their name, anyway. I don't know Japanese. n nTheir immense reputation certainly precedes them, and I've probably even tried one of their creations at Goyemon a long time ago. But even knowing I would almost certainly enjoy Suzuya, I wasn't motivated to make the drive out until a timely UYE that followed the nearby monthly Chaiya Food Fair today. I'm so, so glad that I finally went. n nI ordered the B.A.T. bourbon bacon, arugula, tomatoes, avocado, house made mayo, balsamic vinaigrette, all wrapped in a great, almost spongy crepe. This is by far the best savory crepe I've had, and I'd recommend it as a ""meal "" to precede all your desserts. In terms of sweets, I had a banana hazelnut cream tart, which I almost absent mindedly started eating before realizing how good it was. And my other dessert order, a mango mousse, was topped with diced mango and a coconut dang it what's the word Nelson used? and was heavenly all the way through. n nI was also lucky enough to try what Michael K. ordered. I actually started off on those, first taste being a nice piece of apple pie that he requested to be topped with green tea ice cream. To make this delight, they use puff pastry and fuji apple, two of my favorites, and it's quite possibly the best apple pie you'll find around Vegas. I believe that I described this as ""really, really good. "" n nI also tasted a bit of a custard atop a thing layer of sponge cake, which was also very good, and practically half a cannoli crepe, which was not overly sweet but still a treat with the ricotta cheese, crunchy pistachio bits and semi sweet chocolate pieces. Finally, I tried a green tea eclair with a white chocolate topping, and I almost could have had the white chocolate with that touch of green tea powder by itself. n nI have a few more treats in my fridge waiting for me to recover from the food coma, and I'm confident that I'll enjoy those as well. UPDATE 4 30 14 custard pudding awesome, yuzu panna cotta relatively restrained on yuzu flavor. I won't qualify my recommendation with ""sweets "" or whatever Suzuya is a must try, period.",2

Very high quality and amazing tapenades to accompany the selections we made. Nice start. n nWe each ordered something different and mine was delicious the arugula beet goat cheese salad. It was exceptionally fresh and the dressing was mild but perfect to highlight the other elements in the salad. My friends were equally impressed with their dishes.

I did have a few names to check for but needed help on where to find them. As I walk in, the first thing I do is ask for help. Again, I like to get in and out as quickly as possible, lol. The guy told me that there should be someone back there that could help. Shockingly, no one ever did come to help me n nI found the record section although was still pretty lost as to what I was trying to find. I didn't know whether I was in the new section or the used.

"Went on a Thursday night and the place wasn't too crowded. We were able to get a table pretty quick, but the service was not very good at all. The waitress barely came over to our group to check on us and the bartender needs a lesson in customer service. I told him my drink was lacking in vodka and his response was ""we put the most vodka of any bar on the strip. "" And said I can pay extra to get another shot of vodka if I wanted to. Seriously? Why would I pay extra for something I should have gotten in the first place. Needless to say my friends and I will not be going back. There are way better bars elsewhere. Don't waste your time here.",1
"I've used this florist for the last few years because the flowers are of good quality. Unfortunately, they have a problem counting. Last year I ordered 2 dozen roses for delivery and my wife received only 1 dozen. They refunded the difference so I decided to try them again this year. Well, I was disappointed again. They delivered 23 roses. I just can't use them any more.",1
"Rediculous! Was told there would be a 25 min wait, which was hard with our special need twins, but instead we waited over 45 minutes, meanwhile 2 tops were walking in being seated, spoke to the ""manager "" who was rude wasn't willing to put 2 tops together! Needless to say their food might be good but who cares with that wait attitude, you can get breakfast anywhere!",1
"the best things they had were there dumplings. after that the fried pork was decently cooked but no flavoring what so ever. nas for the main stuff. nthe sushi rolls were OK but not good, the teriyaki chicken was downright nasty. imagine someone grilling a piece of chicken whenever taking it out of the fridge cutting it in small pieces then putting cold teriyaki sauce over it and youve got there version of chicken teriyaki. gross and cold. nthere beef teriyaki was slightly better than that if you consider that it was hot. other than that not much. the meat was really tough and tasted more like shoe leather than beef. n nover all the high light of the entire meal was the white rice. i wont be going back.",1
The stinky tofu was OK but I have had much better. It wasn't stinky enough and inside had the texture of a sponge The kimchi that came with the tofu was downright wimpy. n nI had a noodle dish that was way too oily. There was very little meat on it. n nService wasn't that friendly or helpful. n nThere are many other Chinese restaurants that offer better values and better food so I see no reason to recommend this one. Except for a few items this restaurant is ordinary Chinese food and bears little resemblance to real Taiwanese.,1
We thought that we would give this place a shot considering the positive reviews. However our visit was all but positive. First of all I don't believe that the air conditioning was working. I know that in the past some places do this to encourage the beer consumption. I don't necessarily have a problem with this but if thats the case at least make sure that the beer is cold. I spoke to someone up at bar and she basically said that because the beer is brewed there its not served cold but just slightly colder than room temperature. If I wanted a warm pint of bitter I'll go to the U.K. Needless to say we won't be back.,1
"Worst customer service ever. Every time I go to this salon there is a LONG WAIT. I'm talking like hours. It's not because their service is good, it's because they have 2 people working all the time and they always tell you it will be 15 minutes and you end up waiting an hour and a half. I just left for the last time I will never go back to NV nails.",1
"This review is specifically for the All American Bar and Grille in the Rio Hotel. n nWe came on Thanksgiving night and it was our worst meal and service we had during our week long stay in Vegas. n nI get that the servers probably were loathing the fact they were working on Thanksgiving night. However, you don't need to show your customers your anguish and lack of manners. n nFood was mediocre at best, which was surprising considering the Rio buffet has such a good rep. n nOur server though avoided us for most of the night, was non social, and could have cared less about our experience. n nNot a good way to treat your customers.",1
"I went to cheddars with my mother while I was in town visiting. She had up talked this place so much and convinced me to go. We went around 2pm on a Tuesday well after the lunch rush. We were sat pretty quickly. It took a while for our server to even take our drink orders. As we were sitting there I noticed multiple ants on the table. My mother nodded it off that they probably had just sprayed for bugs and came out. At this point I wasn't really feeling eating there. Out server finally came and took our drink orders, we already knew what we wanted because that's how long it took for her to come over. I ordered their loaded baked potato soup which was delicious and the monte cristo sandwich, also delicious. Low and behold I came down with a very unpleasant bout of food poisoning. I will not be going back during any of my future visits.",1
"Good food service but there are flies flying all over the place, totally gross if you ask me.",1
"They have a great menu, but if you can't get what you order, it sucks! Bartender Leanne says I can get hash browns instead of fries and then brings fries. Disappointed. She was telling her patrons about all the shots she had last night",1
"This nail salon used to have much better service. Stopped going here, then decided to give them another chance. Boy was I disappointed. Water was cold, then the girl stabbed me twice while cleaning and trimming my cuticles.",1
"We stopped in here to play a little and it is beautiful. They really pay attention to details to a tee! Even the ashtrays were stenciled with their signature ""B "" every one of them. n nWe mainly wanted to come by to watch the water show outside, at night. We saw 2 of them. And they were spectacular!",2
"Really enjoyed Le Majestique. The food was really good even though I am not the biggest fan of tapas and the drinks were delicious. n nI really like the atmosphere here, and the staff are amazing. Will definitely go back again.",2
"Nice location in Chinatown and very spacious. Tons of parking in the large lot shared with other businesses. Doesn't seem too hole in the wallish. n nMy main complaint is that the service seems to be somewhat lacking. Once seated, it took awhile for our server to come by and take our orders for drinks or to even serve us water. When we were seated, there wasn't even a whole lot of people in the restaurant. Maybe a large family group of 10 and another couple. Once given the waters, we placed our orders. What should have been a 2 5 minute wait took about 10 minutes before our pho was served. It was way too long for pho plus given that there wasn't a whole lot of people in the restaurant anyways. n nThe combination pho was pretty good. Soup was flavored well and on par with most other pho restaurants I've tried. The quantity of meat and bean sprouts basil was on par. Not too generous but not too skimpy. n nAt the end of the meal, again it took awhile for us to get our check. By then, I decided to just walk up to the register and pay for it up there rather than waiting for the server. n nOverall, the quality of food is good but it's the service that really irked me.",2
Shitty drive thru service! Asked for a Chicken quesadilla and got a burnt quesadilla with onions in it! Employees need more training.,1
"A very nice place to go for lunch especially. The food here is very good and in the warmer month sitting outside on the Vegas Strip is quite an experience. Try the scallops! It's a bit pricy, but the location when you sit outside is very nice!",2
A non red meat eater walked into The Keg.that's how my story starts! I am not known for making trips to a steakhouses but I have to say I like this place. The staff are super friendly and are eager in helping you make a selection of drinks or food. I highly recommend the Strawberry Lemonade! Supposedly there's Gin in this drink but I did not taste a drop! I tried the Teriyaki Chicken with a yummy pineapple cilantro salsa! I chose the Twice Bake Potato as my side.omg there's bacon it! This was amazing and I need the recipe! They don't have a bad happy hour menu. I won't change my non red meat eating ways but I will continue to visit the Keg. n n n Side note Yes I eat bacon. I don't eat Red Meat by choice and not for a cause.,2
"The shoes section is not an extravagant, the rack area between the clothes is cramped I wear a size 2 in jeans , the purses are over priced but other than that everything is a good deal. What inventory they do have is in pretty good quality. Their staff is so rude and incompetent which is mainly the reason I stay away, some of the worst employees a store could hire.",1
Food is simply fabulous as is the service. Everything was super fresh and of the finest quality. n nI was given a Groupon coupon. Groupon messed up and did not print the promotional menu with the offer. When I arrived I'd already decided what I wanted to try off the regular menu. Upon being seated found the set menu I immediately brought to the server's attention that the coupon did not state a preset menu. He explained how they'd provided the menu and it was Groupon's error but he would do his utmost to accommodate me he did. We ended up half off the preset and regular menu. n nWe spent a comfortable and leisurely 2.5 hours to eat our meal and were thoroughly impressed. Everything was delicious and the amount of food was more than sufficient. The service was attentive without being sticky. n nWe left a 20 tip and vowed we'd return. n nA bit pricey.,2
"Pretty disappointed in my experience here. First of all I called to get my car diagnosed. The guy quoted me 163. My car guy friend called them to get a price for my car to be diagnosed and he got 148. That was pretty messed. We specifically asked them if they had the software to code parts for newer mecedes, they said yes. Then I had my car towed there. They told me I would get a diagnosis and quote the next day. I didn't. When I called them the following day, they quoted me all my work. I looked over the invoice and called the guy back a couple hours later to tell him what I wanted to do and he didn't tell me when the car would be ready. I called the next day to see when it would be ready, they said tomorrow. They called me today to say actually we need 3 more days because they have to send out the part to be coded. They blatantly lied about this. They said they could code it when in fact they couldn't. If I'm spending over 2 grand at your store, underpromise and overdeliver. These guys are more overpromise and underdeliver. If you are looking for a Mercedes shop who can code their parts, this is NOT the place to go. Very disappointed in my experience.",1
"We made the trip to The Auld Dubliner on a Saturday late afternoon to have some drinks and a snack before the hockey game. We were all hungry and everything on the menu sounded delicious. First off drinks . . . Guinness please! As they say, ""when in rome, "" or in this case ""when in an Irish Pub. "" n nNow time to decide on food. So many choices! I ended up going with a grilled veggie sandwich called Ploughman's Sandwich. My friend got the Chicken Pesto Sandwich and the boys both got a boxty Shepards Pie and Cornned Beef. Right as the server was leaving, we added an order of the Spicy Potatoes, I had to try them! n nWhile we were waiting to get our food, which didn't take too long, there was plenty of fun stuff on the walls to keep us busy for our first visit anyway. When the Spicy Potatoes arrived, we couldn't wait to jump in. Small, new potatoes, fried and tossed in wing sauce, sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles and served with ranch. These were by far the star of the meal! The Dubliner had a perfectly tangy wing sauce that I wanted to put on everything! n nOnce we finished those off, which did not take long at all, our food arrived and we were all pleased with that as well. On my veggie sandwich, the ciabata was perfect very soft, which isn't always the case with ciabata. The sandwich was great, and also helped to clear my sinuses with all of the horseradish. I love horseradish, however if you don't, I would suggest asking for it without the sauce. n nThe boxtys were good sized, not too big which is a plus when none of us wanted to get tired, we had a hockey game to go to! They were served almost like a crepe, folded in quarters, with the filling oozing out of the side and scattered on top. Very tasty! n nI can't wait to attend another sporting event in Glendale so I have a reason to return to The Auld Dubliner.",2
"The food was decent, after we waited 51 minutes to get it. 51minutes! We weren't offered a refill even once, when all 4 of our drinks were empty. Our server brought meals to 4 other groups after us, before finally realizing that we hadn't gotten ours. She blamed it on the printer, and slapped us in the face with a 25 discount offer. We will never come back.this is the 2nd time we've eaten here and had similar problems. It's just not worth all the crap.",1
"I participated in their ""Engineer for an Hour "" program. For 250 they teach you how to drive one of four diesel locomotives in their collection. I choose the huge Union Pacific GP 30. An engineer and a brakeman ride along with you. The engineer told me how to work the controls and the brakeman acts as your eyes when you go backwards through the railway crossing. The guys were great and made the experience a lot of fun. n nIt took two hours each way to get there and back on the bus from my Las Vegas Strip hotel but it was definitely worth it. I will do this again to try out another one of their locomotives. n n 8 train rides are also available on weekends.",2
Dam Hot Now Light! I swear there is a Krispy Kreme low jack device in my truck! Everytime that light is glowing there goes my truck! I fight it but no use. Customer Service is hit or miss. Mostly a hit.,2
The tikka masala is to die for. Love the food here. The staff is also super patient about explaining the menu. This is far from home but I'll still make the journey. I hav dreams about the tikka masala.,2
"No food does it for me quite like a bone in ribeye so when we saw it on the menu it became a ""must order. "" And clearly this decision was among the best we've made in a town full of.well.let's just say ""not so great ones. "" The waiter instructed us to order it medium, if we normally were medium rare guys, as they under cook their steaks and he was right. I've actually never ordered a steak above medium rare but this one came out just to my liking. Now what made this steak perfection was simple perfect amount of salt, pepper, rosemary to season, which allowed it to be nicely charred and then they drizzle it with great olive oil at the table. WOW is the right word to describe it as I not only helped finish the steak with my two buddies but I got the bone and tore it apart there are pictures to prove that I sat there and ate every piece of steak off the bone like some sort of dog . Ok my apologies for the novel on just the steak but I had to share the love I've developed for Vegas via this ribeye. nOther amazing highlights the bread with the two spreads. The only negative I have about the pork fat spread is just the name a rebranding of such is in need to soften what sounds like ""heart attack in a bowl! "" Maybe call it something like ""pork infused butter! "" nIt's quite amazing, especially when you mix it with the normal butter at the table. nFor the sides we got a truffle pasta honestly I don't remember this dish much, as I was in heavenly bliss with my steak while it occupied space on our table , which tasted pretty damn great. We also got the mash potatoes, which I did sample at the end and they were quite epic. We ended dinner with a chocolate and peanut butter torte for my buddy's birthday and that also was fantastic! Just perfect ending to a perfect meal with great friends, food and vino! Mr. Batali you've outdone yourself again and the name is perfect, as it truly sums it all up!",2
Been going here for 20 years. Really enjoy the atmosphere in the store. Only complaint is that price is higher than usual Fry's Food and Drug. Their baked goods are very good. Nice experience!,2
Great donut selection and price! Be prepared with cash as they don't take credit or debit!,2
I had to get a rental while my car was getting some repairs finished 2 doors down. The body shop called these guys while I was standing there when I got there about 10 minutes later they acted like they had no idea what was going on. Tyler kept trying to shove their additional insurance down my throat despite me repeatedly telling him that I did NOT need it they would have the car back by the end of the day. It was obvious what I was saying was going in one ear out the other they really didn't give a crap about what I told them. I would NEVER recommend this Enterprise location to ANYONE!,1
"My husband is a professional Bass player and he gets everything he needs from Sam Ash. Today, we traveled 2 hours from Asheville NC to come here. We like this place! Decent customer service and they are willing to match prices!",2
"So, we got some croquetas, chicharrones, and some ropa vieja. The chicharrones seemed like the kind you get from a bag. Very disappointing. The croquetas were okay. The ropa vieja was average. The best thing was the rice ans beans that came with the plate. I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend. I won't waste my money at this place again.",1
"I've come here a couple times and I really enjoy the atmosphere. The honey toast is delicious and their lattes are consistently made well and look great. Lattes cost about 4.50 and the honey toast costs about 8.50. The wait time isn't too long and it's a great place to come and chill. A lot of people come to socialize, read, or just do homework. I wish the tables here were a little bigger though. I usually come with a group of 5 or 6 and the tiny circular tables aren't the best. n nThe bottom line Serenade is a great place if you want to relax and enjoy a good cup or tea or coffee, but just don't expect it to be cheap.",2
"I have nothing against Capezio products, however regardless of location the prices are always over the top. This store is always disorganized with products sliding off the racks and exceedingly snotty and arrogant customer service. Rude. Bad selection. Discount Dance is by far a better choice. 1 star is generous.",1
"This review is for my fellow moms and dads! Some of us are not a holes like Mr. Wynn and have our children carried by nannies everywhere. We were roaming around Vegas with our 3 month old and decided to hit up the Wynn buffet. As soon as we get in, a man stops us and tells us that ""Mr. Wynn does not allow strollers because it is a safety hazard "". Right. and if everyone pushed around a Gucci stroller would it still be as dangerous? That's some BS baby discrimination, so we left! I think those with families should not support this place. You're an a hole ""Mr. Wynn ""!",1
Best place ever! The meats delicious! Great service! Best thing to get is one of each!,2
"The pizza is great and the location is fun. I would recommend trying to find a slower time as it is not worth a 2 hour wait, unless you have plenty of time to enjoy the bar next door for a glass of wine or beer. Having said that, the pizza really is very good.",2
"As an Arizona native I was excited to try the Phoenix location on central as I had already tried the Mesa location and was a bit underwhelmed. I was hoping that the Phoenix location would impress me and live up to the rumors I had heard. The server was fast and reasonable polite, and after ordering two combo platters beef burro and chicken burror the food was out in under ten minutes. This was surprising, as I expected a longer wait do to the self proclamation of all food made to order. Unfortunately, this was the last pleasant experience here. n I would like to claim that the food was just ok, but in truth it was pretty awful. The chicken was dry and had a slightly rotten taste to it as if it been sitting around for a few days. the beans were undercooked, crunchy in fact. The rice was okay but it seems very dry and tasteless, even after dumping half of the salsa on top of it. My father's beef burro faired none better as he referred to it as ""mushed up cat food "". n As an active man of large stature 6'4 240lbs , it is rare for me to leave a meal unfinished, but in this instance, I found myself abandoning the plate and retreating hungry and unhappy. If this was a bargain priced restaurant I would be more understanding, but for 12 dollars I expect more than boiled chicken, undercooked beans, and tasteless rice. Oh, and they unknowingly charge you 1 per small chip bowl which you find on your bill when you pay.for shame! Save your time and visit one of the many glorious Mexican restaurants in the area, just not here. But if you do, worry not on seeing me as I shall never return!",1
"As the other reviewers have mentioned, SemiChem is a less exciting alternative to Boots and Superdrug. This one is particularly hectic and it's usually a struggle to find what you're looking for with most of the shelves overflowing with stuff. n nThey do have some good deals on perfumes now and again but they're usually ones that are pretty old school. n nI guess it's worth a browse to check out the offers and it's particularly good for picking up face wipes and make up remover but apart from that I'll stick to Boots and Superdrug.",1
I miss the reuben dog. Do they still do this?,2
"We went for lunch. We've been to Rula Bula in Tempe and Auld Dubliner in Peoria.both were much better than Lis Doon Varna. nI ordered corned beef melt.very salty, on a chabatta roll no less.not very irish. nHusband ordered bangers and mashed.he said the bangers tasted like a bratwurst not british bangers. nThe atmosphere was nice.may be a good drinking place.not happy with the food.",1
"Great place to heal old childhood trauma and get that Cabbage Patch doll you never got as a kid. n nI love you Bookman's. If you consider a bookstore to be your saving salvation then you will love it here. When you walk in it usually smells like bacon or panini's or whatever the heck they are cooking up in the cafe. You can sit in the cafe area and get a lemon bar but they also have many other baked goods and sandwiches to choose from. n nThey have old records and a bunch of old crazy crap in the back that you will love. The kids section has a cute little entry way just for kids and they sell toys, puzzles and games. They also have old vintage action figures from movies and shows. Pretty much any book you could be looking for they probably have which is all categorized so it is easy to find. If you cannot find it though they will be happy to help you in your quest. n nThey have a manga section and located just off of the cafe section, they have magazines and comics! I found old Creep comics that were 5 that are really worth 15. They have a porno collection in an armoire but everyone can see you look into it so most guys look awkwardly into it for a minute before walking away. n nBooks are reasonably priced and the price can be found penciled in the book on the first page on the upper right hand corner. They have a gaming section where you can buy games and old gaming systems like the original Nintendo. Make sure you make time to look near the registers, that is where they have the really interesting stuff.",2
"Finally tried this place I had the pork broth my wife had the miso broth. you could barely tell them apart. Both were totally bland, the pork was tasteless, the egg way overcooked, even the gyoza was overdone and plain. Plus the place was dirty. at least the beer was cold.",1
"The restaurant itself smelled like sewer probably why there is a patio. Husband and I were ignored by the female behind the bar for several minutes, after seating ourselves,while she talked on the phone. A girl who came on shift actually helped us before bar lady hung up.but they proceeded to gossip, loudly, and serve themselves drinks before us. I had to get up to ask for service and to check on our food that I had watched sit there for at least 10 minutes. We were the only couple there, and they acted like we were a chore. Service was so bad, the food got cold. Suprised the place is still in business. Never going back, don't recommend. I'd give negative stars if I could.",1
Awesome service! The Geico Rep was great and helped me out and even brought my ncar to the service department to check my tires and air pressure. When he brought it back they had given my car a quick wash! Great first impression that's for sure,2
"As Pho goes, this place is the real deal. From broth being made from marrow to the sauces that accompany each dish, this place has Lao written all over it. n nA hidden gem west of town, do not be dissuaded by its appearance from affar. Spring rolls with tasty chunky peanut sauce traditional Pho will more than satisfy your craving.",2
Excellent food on all our visits. Went with a friend on a gluten free diet. The gluten free pasta w pomodoro sauce is worth another visit.,2
"Like other reviewers have said, I expected a more intimate setting and was surprised to see something so large and bustling. Not a bad thing, just a mismatched expectation reality thing. n nWe started with some bruschettas. All good! Especially loved the mozzarella and apple caponata ones. For my main I had the big eye tuna gorgeously done. Nice big chunks of meat that were seared nicely, on a bed of couscous and yumminess. I tried a bit of my dad's spicy pasta. SO spicy. Impressively spicy, really. n nThe desserts were also great, and I have a hard time picking my favorite. Perhaps the coconut cakes in that soupy coconut sauce. I didn't get to try the chocolate cake but it looked really good. n nWe were in the back room which offered us some respite from the noise of the restaurant a great thing when they bring in an actual DJ and you're just trying to eat dinner! , but it also offered a blast of cold air each time a server went outside to help one of the diners sitting under a heatlamp. Oh well.",2
"They only get 2 stars because the owner needs to learn some serious people skills! I have eaten there twice, the first time was on a week night and there were only about 8 tables seated. Everyone bent over backwards for us, which I expected because they had the time to do it. We liked it so much that we decided to book their New Year's Eve Party. We were 5 minutes late to our 10 30pm reservation and then stood for almost 10 minutes waiting to check in because a large party was standing in the entryway. The hostess turned out to be the owner saw us standing there and ignored us. When we finally got to check in she told us that they had given our table away so we now had to wait. After waiting 10 minutes I asked how much longer it was going to be because we had been told the food service stopped at midnight. I couldn't understand her answer because the DJ music was so loud. When I told her this she started screaming at me that I could stop yelling at her and that if we didn't like it we could walk out because she didn't need people like us. When I tried to explain that I was speaking loudly because of the music she cut me off and screamed at me some more. The other hostesses and guests were in shock. So I decided to ask her name. Her answer was that she was the owner and I could call her the owner or I could get out. Since there were no other options for dinner at that point I asked how long it was going to be and she said she had to find somewhere to ""put us "". We were finally seated last after she seated 6 groups that came in after us. We reached our table at 11 05 and then sat for another 5 minutes before anyone came to the table. There were at least 5 open tables in the section we were in so it was pretty clear there shouldn't have been a problem ""finding somewhere to put us "". The hostess who did seat us apologized repeatedly for her behavior and said she was sorry there was nothing she could do. It was clear from our conversation with her and other staff during the night that outbursts like this are a regular occurrence and the staff are used to trying to make it up to guests who do stay and eat. I guess it should have been a warning when I saw her grabbing party favors out of a guest's hand and yelling at the woman that she could only have 1 item per person. nOur server was wonderful once he realized we were his table. However it was clear the staff bringing the meat around had no idea how to navigate a full restaurant. My plate was constantly empty and we spent half the night craning our necks trying to find the closest meat server. The salad bar was the usual which surprised me for a party that they were charging so much extra for. It is tiny compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses we have been to and both times they have hit a big pet peeve of mine. They put the salad dressing in front of the tray of salad so lettuce drops into it during the night. By the time we got to the salad bar the dressing was full of lettuce, which is a health code violation. It has happened both times we have eaten there, so it is clearly not something they care to keep neat. The meats were so salty that I had to ask for center cuts. And after being promised they were serving food until 1am, they stopped bringing meat around at midnight. They put out a dessert buffet at midnight. By 12 20 there were about 20 items left and they were all stale like they had sat out all day before being served. The worse part was they didn't have any more so several people didn't even get dessert which was included in the higher price for the party. We finally had to ask for more fried bananas. Once the server realized we hadn't gotten any dessert he brought us something from their regular menu. nThe last thing that bothered me was on the check. The check had been rung up under a different server's name. When I asked about it we were told that our server was the ""second "" on a team and the name was the ""leader "" of the team. I asked where the leader was, and was told she had already left the floor for the night. I thought it was tacky that I was expected to tip a ""team "" of servers when only one person had spoken to us all night. I am not talking about leaving the bussers and such out. I don't think someone who never even spoke to me should get a tip from me. Especially someone who has already gone home even though we are still seated. nWe won't be going back unless someone else is buying for certain. If you do go, make sure it is on a slow night so you get good service and pray you don't cross paths with the owner.",1

"Copper Star Coffee is one of my favorite local, central Phoenix, coffee houses in addition to Hob Nobs and Lux . Copper Star Coffee is located in a converted, vintage, automotive service and gas station right along a growing 7th Avenue corridor. What sets Copper Star apart from some of the other local coffee houses is their car hop service. There are times when I find myself in a hurry and a drive through is convenient. Although there is a Starbucks equipped with a drive through a mile north, I prefer to keep my dollars local and the fact that Copper Star has a drive through help me do just that. Each time I visit Copper Star, there is always something different in the way of pastries or muffins. On one visit in November they had scratch made pumpkin and raisin muffins. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin in any form other than pie, but I over heard someone there mention they were really good. Being in a festive mood that day I bought one and was very pleased. As far as I know, everything is made in house or is local. The Batista's pull a mean shot. When it's 110 degrees out, nothing tastes better than an iced double americano no cream . I'm not sure where they get their coffee from exactly, but it full flavored without being over roasted. Free WiFi is a great perk as I've gone there several times to read my morning digital news. The staff is always friendly and the service prompt.",2
"Always wanted ot go to Vegas just to go and see Wayne Newton. Not really a gambler, although my husband is, I was wan't really sure what I would find to do and where I should look to stay. Honestly all we needed was a clean room, with internet, a clean and functional bathroom, and a comfortable clean bed from sleeping. We never travel with the intention on spending a lot of time in our hotel rooms so we don t need a lot of perks or special ammenities. n nOh, and did I mention we always travel on a low budget to ensure we get to do a lot of things throughout the year. Because I found a great deal for the Luxor which provided us free buffet breakfast with each night so we were sold on staying here. n nThe hotel itself looked spectacular on the outside.but when you entered the first floor casino level it was a little dark and dated looking. The trip to our room was a little interesting too the elevators move sideways going up because of the pyrimid shape and apparently not all of the elevators go to every floor. n nOur room was clean, but needed some serious TLC and a remake a dimley lit room with cracks in walls, wired internet with a hiden cable behind the television, and a bathroom that was a little questionable. However, for the price we paid it was a good room. n nIf you don't mind not having a more modern room and you're looking for a place to sleep on a budget, this is the place to go while in Vegas.",1
"I love the patio, so it saddens me to give Park on Fremont such a low rating. n nWe came here for lunch in the middle of the week at about 11 30, so It wasn't overly busy. We were seated immediately. After about five minutes, our waitress took our orders for drinks I ordered a water, my friend ordered a coke. It took at least fifteen minutes to get our drinks. Thanks to checking in shortly after placing our drink order, I know I'm not exaggerating. When our waitress brought our drinks, she brought my friend the wrong drink. We sat another ten minutes and without her coke. We saw the waitress walk by with an empty tray and didn't acknowledge us or come back to take our food orders. Since we were on limited time, we had to leave. n nI suggest sitting at the bar if you're in a hurry or on a limited time, maybe the service will be faster and better.",1
"In all honesty, this place has become my go to coffee shop. Whenever I'm too lazy late to make coffee at home, this is where I go. The staff is unbelievably friendly, the coffee is made to the T, and their baked goods are always deliciously satisfying not to mention, vegan friendly if you're into that . Copper Star pays close attention to the quality of service an goods they provide, which is hard not to notice. There's more than one reason why I keep coming back here, and when you give this place a shot you'll see why. n nOverall, Copper Star owns the coffee biz West of Central. There's no reason to go anywhere else.",2
"I've lived in Pittsburgh for what feels like forever and in all of that time, I guess I've never been to the Strip District on a Monday. We didn't realize most of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. Tried Thin Man, closed. Luke Wholey's, closed. We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for 14.99. Ok, we were game. n nWe've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight! n nThat couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule? n nThe upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar. I may give this place another shot based on that but, never again on their lobster roll.",1
"I was here during the day and it's not all that it's hyped up to be. If you want decent seating you have to be there basically from the night before . j k n nBut seriously it's really crowded. It was hard to find seating. My cousins found some space and as soon as we got comfy a host came over and said they sold this table. There was no reserve sign or anything. We told the host that we had just ordered a pitcher of sangria and what should we do, cancel the order, what?!? The host said don't worry she'll come find you. As soon as he said that our waitress comes over tells us to sit at a neighboring table and just as my cousins about to sit down security tells us that it's reserved. By now it's super embarrassing because it looks like we're getting kicked out but really the staff is just bouncing us around. My cousin Kim and I are over this whole scene and just leave. Sucks to be that waitress o n nAside from the few eye candy, it's not worth your time. You can still hear the music and there's plenty of room and sun by the regular pool. You don't really get that much sun at Tao Beach because the building and partitions block most of the rays.",1
"We just had our wedding in the Silver Chapel this past weekend and it went perfectly. Our wedding planner kept in touch and told us everything we needed to complete prior to our arrival in Vegas. We paid 60 for the pianist to play 15 minutes as our 40 guests were being seated and I had multiple people comment on how wonderful the music was. The spring mix of flowers were also beautiful and a medium bouquet was the perfect size. n nThe pictures turned out great, we had so many to choose from, and the photographer was excellent. I wish purchasing extra photos, other than the 20 included, was not so expensive. The extra 2 8x10's were 105 after shipping and tax, but I understand photographers are always pricey. n nThe Opal Shores package was perfect for us and I love that it included 20 4x6's, 6 5x7's and a DVD of the ceremony. For the reception we used a Media Suite in Mandalay and ordered our food from an outside vendor, Masterpice Cuisine. We ordered food for 35 people and had leftovers, and the food was delicious! n nMuch cheaper and more fun than a 300 person wedding in the Midwest. It was a wonderful day for us!",2
"In the mall and decided to get some Thai tea from Yoyo. Tea was not ready and took 20 min to make. Upon receiving our Thai tea it was not sweet at all made wrong . If something is on the menu staff really should know how to make it right. Ended up throwing it away after a couple sips. Yes, I should have know better then to buy Thai tea from a non Thai restaurant.",1
Had the red velvet cake ice cream it was awesome!,2
Did a great job. I have a barber down in old town Scottsdale and have been going to him for years. Now that I moved I had to get someone closer. Being very particular about my hair I was worried however at the end they did a great job and well priced! Coming back for more cuts!,2
"So we are staying at a local resort and called for a delivery. Of course they knew they were delivering to a resort maybe some plates or napkins at the very least some plastic forks ect. would have been nice. Now let's move on to the food TERRIBLE! No sweet and sour sauce for dipping for the egg rolls or sweet and sour chicken that was ordered. Seen on here biggest egg rolls around, panda has bigger then this crap. Pork fried rice bland. Even my 9 year old says why is there hardly any filling in the egg roll and she never complains about anything. Portions from Chinese food places are for the most part generous well not at this place. And the prices for the quality and portions is a joke. Could continue with more but think you get the picture. Don't waste your money on this place!",1
"I discovered this place on the recommendation of one of my coworkers about 4 months ago, and it has become my definite favorite hole in the wall mexican place, with very flavorful, smooth, red enchilada sauce and very fresh, large portions. This is a lunch stop for me you won't catch me in this area at night. , there is a beef quesadilla that is excellent or the mucho macho burrito will definitely fill you up, both for under 7. The service can be brusque, but to be honest for this type of place I really don't want to interact with the servers any more than to give my order and ask for more of their salsa.",2
"An example of one of their stupid idiotic ""rules "" is this. At the gate next to us, a flight for Al Paso was posted to leave at 6 50 but it was delayed for 1 hour. A couple left to get some food and arrived back in about 20 minutes . but their plane had left. The rule is that even if we post a delay your flight might leave R Amy time without you . So, if the airline is late they can fool you I to leaving and then take off without you WTH again?",1
"I had a deep cleaning done there and have gone to a few other dentist in the valley before finding this one. I chipped a tooth when I was young and it stayed on for about 10 years. I broke it off here and after going to a few dentist it fell off about 4 more times in 6 months. I went to east valley and they fixed a prevous dentist's bad work for free. I ended up breaking it off 2 more times and they did a veneer for me. I admittedly had some issue with the temporary but this office was helpful in getting through it and rushed my permanent one. I had to go in about 5 times to get help but in the end now I have a perfect looking and feeling tooth. n nPercilia in the front office is VERY peppy and happy and helpful. She also is a skilled assistant I found out she helped me on a day there was no one in the office on fixing a tooth. n nGood dentist are hard to find and I highly recommend them, they do a good job and care about their patiants.",2
"Brought my department here to celebrate a record sales month. Had a great time, service was wonderful. Would definitely come back.",2
"Checked this place out during a quick visit to Vegas. Stayed next door at the Blue Green hotel. These guys have an awesome wood fired oven at their disposal. Producing decent pizza should be a no brainer. Ordered one two top 16 "", one 14 "" two top and a 2lt coke, 30. nGot back to the hotel and realized they left off one of the toppings. Should not be hard to make a two topping pizza? n nOne bite and realized I was eating a wood fired Totino's pizza. They use very cheap ingredients and do a mediocre job with the cooking. The crust was actually okay. What a waste of a pizza oven.",1
"My complaint is with the UPS service that I received when I shipped at this store. I spoke to a business in another state and they asked me to ship a package by FEDEX. I decided out of convenience to go to the UPS Store near my home. The staff was very nice and they said that UPS would guarantee to deliver the package the next day. I paid the rate because it was called NEXT DAY AIR and it was ""GUARENTEED "" to arrive in 24 hours. n nThe package was not delivered in 24 hours. The staff was very apologetic but the result was that a package that was guaranteed to be delivered in 24 hours was delivered in 48 hours. n nThey quickly processed a refund, but I would rather have had the package delivered on time. n nI learned my lesson. I will NEVER ship with UPS again.",1
"I hate writing bad reviews and I usually don't but after seeing all of these 5 stars I'm suspicious. I went in recently for lunch. The salsa was bland. Thick, hard chips. I ordered a cheese enchilada and chicken flautas. Boring. Bland. And my stomach hurt after. I don't know what people see here but I won't be back. If they can't wow me with a few basic items I am not wasting any time or money to try anything else. Plus the service was eh. I had to go up front to pay after sitting there for 10 minutes.",1
"I eat at a different Village Inn often. I've even ordered catering for work events. I was in the area and decided to stop by this store. Unfortunately they fell very short on providing acceptable service. I should have known there may be a problem when I walked in. There were 12 people waiting in line to pay and leave. There was one woman complaining about something to the assistant manager. I'm not sure about what, but I heard the assistant manager sarcastically and loudly say in front of everyone in the lobby, ""Oh! I assure you ma'am I did. "" She was obviously pissed off and she stormed out. n nAs for me, I waited 15 minutes at the table without a beverage. In the meantime two other tables after me were seated and had theirs. I went to the front to complain, but there were no employees at the register or podium. Someone finally came up. I asked to speak with the manager. She said he was in the kitchen but would get him for me. It was the assistant manager I saw before. I told him about the slow service. All he did was tuck in his shirt while saying to me ""I am so sorry. "" He made no offer to rectify the problem, so I walked out.",1
"This is a terrific homewares store! Great selections of many categories of merchandise. It ain't cheap, but it's all quality stuff. n nMost of the people are knowledgeable happily helpful. n nAlmost everything I've bought here is completely satisfying. On a rare occasion I've taken something back they simply replaced it or refunded my money. No big deal about it. n nWhenever I need something along their line, BB B is where I go first. Then I don't have to go anywhere else second.",2
"Fat Head's is a great local establishment and I'll forgive them that they opened a store in Cleveland instead of a second Pittsburgh location. They have an excellent beer selection and of course, delicious and unique burgers. However, I still can't believe they DON'T HAVE A VEGGIE BURGER! That's the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5.",2
"Love our server, Ruan spelt with a R . He was incredible and so fun! He earned the extra star! My Cobb salad that he recommended was one of the best ever once he suggested their house blue cheese dressing. The dressing that was on it originally lacked a bit in flavor. My other half had the soup, and it was a bit salty. Ruan could tell he wasn't crazy about it and brought him another without us even asking! The other soup was also a bit salty. Delicious bread brought to our table. 2 on the soups, 4 on the salads. Would come back again!",2
"Yellow cab in Pittsburgh is a total joke. They're never on time. Good luck getting one after 12 AM. They don't show up, when they do they act like they don't know how to process a credit card, they're shady, and they're just downright unprofessional. This city needs a public transportation overhaul. The fact that you can't get a cab after having a night out with your friends is absolutely ridiculous.",1
"Worst experience ever! They have printed that polish change is 10, then they charge my card 12! Owner starts yelling at me when I questioned charge but it is printed on the wall, told me to never come back, very unprofessional completely wrong how they treated me for questioning, this treatment made me go off on them! Plus the nail tech paint on French manicure is horrible! Less than 1 STAR! I paid the 12 but will never go back, don't waste your time money!",1
"Can you say Ghost town? Hated it. None of the reviews explain how I feel about this place. Someone commented clean restrooms? That was clearly a joke. Good service, even funnier! I can agree that the drinks are cheap, but I didn't even know that until I was already there. n nThe first time I went was on a Thursday. My friend and I went together, there were 4 couples there and a guy playing pool by himself. The bartender must have know the couples at the bar because my friend and I could barely get service when we walked up throughout the night. The place was empty! n nI decided maybe Thursday night wasn't their thing and went back on a Friday. There were lots more people, but mostly people watchers like in other reviews. I'm sorry, but if I have to be 21 to get in, I'm pretty sure you can keep ""shit "" in the song and not bleep it out. Also, maybe it's because I just moved from a military town, but our favorite thing is to yell ""FUCK THE ARMY "" at the top of our lungs during Copper Head Road. Is this foreign to everyone here? n nGet it together. This place is for old fogies.",1
Best NY style pizza in the valley. You can order it by the slice with any toppings. n nThis is the only place I eat chicken wings at because they are crispy and aren't those extra large chicken legs you get elsewhere. n nGet a Buffalo Chicken Calzone with no ricotta. It's my favorite.,2
"WHY DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 3.5 STARS? n nWHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TERRIBLE LIE? n nSandwiches were BLAND, as in, NO FLAVOR on the meat, NONE! We both experienced this at different times, so pretty accurate. At least the meat was tender and served hot although microwaved . n nOn another day. I tried the strawberry shortcake, which was lacking strawberries. I finally found one and it tasted like over ripe, almost rotten, squishy strawberries taste when they should be thrown out! I returned the huge slice and got yelled at then had money basically thrown at me, haha, How is it MY FAULT that you chose to use old strawberries and my taste buds caught you? Oh well. To the wrinkled, bleach blonde, Aqua Net Queen Sorry I ruined your day.",1
Had a great stay! Best housekeeping staff! Carol is great. Lady at c I could have been nicer but everyone else made up for it! Love the views. Room service was fast and tasty. Will come back,2
This place has the best pizza! And there customer service is amazing! I would hands down recommend this place if you love NY pizza!,2
2.5 hour wait for a burger is ridiculous. The owners own uncle SAMs next door by now they should have fugues out they aren't getting over flow they should figure out away to use part of uncle dams for burgatory on weekend nights to increase table capacity and finally have the landlord give them permanent outdoor dining. JJ gumberg is too cheap to permanently make their outdoor dining area permanent. If they left this space JJ could never replace them! Although the food is good a 2 hour wait is obscene I have found many replacements,1
"I very rarely write reviews on Yelp, but I have been completely disappointed in the service and care of Banfield Pet Hospital. After moving here in January, I took my dog here on 3 occasions two comprehensive exam appointments and one follow up for a vaccine. All 3 were scheduled in advance. The first appointment I waited over 45 minutes before being seen. The second appointment, which was a simple vaccine that they told me would take 10 minutes, I waited almost an hour. For the third appointment, a comprehensive exam, I was told that I could drop her off and pick her up 2 3 hours later. We scheduled a drop off time for 9 00 am, which I discovered was a joke they scheduled everyone for a drop off time at 9 00 am, and there was only one person present to check in numerous people. I waited over 20 minutes just to check her in. When I left they told me they would call me when she was ready. At 3 00 pm 3 hours past what they said pick up would be , I called. They said that she was still not ready. They did not call me until 4 00, when they told me that she was ready and I could pick her up between 4 15 and 5. Trying to prevent yet another extended wait, I arrived at 4 30. Upon arrival, I was told that she was still not ready. I waited another 15 20 minutes before they finally brought her out. n nIf I felt as though my pet was getting outstanding treatment it might be one thing, but the care my dog has received there has been average at best, and the utter lack of respect they have for their customers' time has been beyond frustrating. They are always trying to sell you something without listening to what the actual, practical needs of your pet are. I will not be returning to Banfield Pet Hospital.",1
"So I took my son into this shop earlier it's a really nice shop a lot of excellent parts very quick estimates for fixing my son's bike at a very fair price, all though I did have 2 major problems with one of the young mechanics named Glen who was working on my son's bike. First he looked stoned out of his mind, 2nd he was very rude and impolite to my son when he was just asking for advice and asking what kind of ""set up "" the young man has on his bike, he had the audacity of calling him a few names and telling him that what he was talking about was gay and stupid, my son is 14 years old and very polite and well mannered and does not deserve to be talked down at all. My son and I will not be returning to this store due to the poor management of employee moral values. That is not how you treat a customer, let alone a child! Very disappointed in this shop.",1
"I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND everyone to go to Stand Up Scottsdale. The comedians were AMAZING and in my opinion, the owner was hilarious. I literally cried because I was laughing so hard. We both fell in love with a comedian by the name of Chris Franjola when we attended our first ever show on 04 27 12. We also visited Stand up Scottsdale this past Friday 05 04 12 and I have to say that both times we had atteneded a show, the place had a very sparse crowd more people NEED to go to this place so Stand Up Scottsdale can stay in business! The servers were very attentive and friendly and the food was pretty good. Overall I would highly recommend this comedy club! A must see! Remember that there is a two drink minimum though, so be prepared to spend a little money. nPros Amazing Comedians n Friendly owner n Good Food for a comedy club n Intimate Setting n Attentive Friendly Service n nCons The crowd was super small.more people need to go!",2
"I don't know what it is about this location, but it's not as good as the others. I come here because a friend of mine comes here regularly, but I wouldn't come to this BWW otherwise. n nMy last visit was this past Thursday evening. I was waiting for my friend in the bar and wanted to order a Ranger IPA. I was told they didn't carry IPA on tap or bottled.WTH? The other location on North Durango 215 has two IPA's on tap.I was there 2 weeks ago, so I know they carry it. I asked the waiter if they recently stopped selling IPA's and he said he didn't know and didn't even know what an IPA beer was! I settled on a 24 oz Newcastle and put away 4 or 5 before the night was over. n nWow, I thought that BWW's were suppose to be consistent with their product. I guess I was wrong.whatever. n nWill I come back? Only when I come to visit my friend, otherwise I wouldn't come to this location. There are better BWW's in Vegas.",1
"No tacos here! n nCozy corner spot with a little terrace decorated in ranch style. n nDishes are served ""casserole "" style, where each diner picks a few small plates and shares with the table. I sampled the nopales, chille relleno, an excellent pork dish with pineapple and the black beans with cheese. The menu included a selection of at least 15 different casseroles ranging from chiles to chicken, steak and even shrimp. Also a selection of starters and a table d'h u00f4te offering. Chips, salsa, tortillas and toppings included. And of course, margaritas, beer and wine. n nWas a fun dunning experience and the food was tasty but it doesn't come cheap. Each dish runs 6 9 , two dishes per person plus a tecate.don't expect to leave for less than 30 a head. That being said, worth a try if you've been searching for that elusive Montreal Mexican food fix!",2
" hic n nThe bartendress was beautiful and liberal with the booze. I'm coming back! n nOh, and the food was excellent. I had the fish tacos.",2
"I love my security door. It was such an easy process, it looks good, and didn't take long to get the door put on. Thank you!",2
Love this place! Best Mexican food I've found in Mesa.,2
"hmmm, we were stuck between shows at MGM so tried the buffet. i wonder how they stay in business? Very hard to find anything good to eat! price is quite high for what you get. do gamblers get comp ed to reduce the 25 cost. if you must eat at MGM, find something else. but, hey, there was no line!",1
"Great staff, but extremely overpriced. The three tacos came out to about 12.00, with no sides. The quality of the taco didn't warrant their price nothing extraordinary or exotic. We Ordered a side of beans and a side of chips with salsa another 5.00. The tortillas were not cooked, just warmed, and the tacos themselves were cold. Also, our salsa was freezing! Chilled I assumed. Our chips were room temperature. The atmosphere and staff are great, but I won't be returning.",1
"A classic tradition of my friends and family and I is to go to Sensi at the Bellagio. n nThe truth is that it is always a warm and emotional experience. What a flavor and technique these guys employ! n nThe menu changes seasonally, but they always find space for the octopus. If anyone knows anything about octopus, they should know that it takes talent to get them to be tender and flavorful. SENSI's octopii are stunning. Once, my girlfriend and I were on our way to dinner, and she had to stop here first and eat a dish of octopus. n nI must mention that the bartenders are ""born to be "" bartendersl. They are classy, attentive, and can talk to you about anything while still managing to fire out the most complex, incredible drinks. Osval is one of my favorites. Truly a good man, if there are any. n nThe bathroom is all black! I do not know why I am attracted to this bathroom, but it definately is on my top 10 best bathroom list. The Mandarin Oriental, The montage Hotel beverly hills, and the Encore hotel are also in my top ten. n nSensi. Never jammed packed. It is in a sweet spot of the Bellagio, away from the hustle and bustle of masses. n nGo get em'!",2
"To preface this review I am from Chicago, and snobbishly so. I've lived in Madison for 5 months and most of the food doesn't really satiate my palate. I've had Full Of Bull twice, and they make excellent sandwiches. I ordered online and have had both the burger and the italian beef. Both were incredible and satisfied my arrogant taste. n nThe curly fries make the restaurant that much better. They are delicious. n nDelivery is a bit long.",2
"Meh. I've experienced better could not better describe my stay at the PH hotel and casino. Other features like PF Changs, Earl of sando, the miracle mile shops, and their location makes this place okay to stay at and deserve 5 stars. n nThis hotel and casino on the other hand kinda sucks. And let me say I am no prude and a young man whos used to not so great circumstances. I go to vegas and drop money to have a nice experience. The room is so dark you cant see anything, the girl at the desk could not have been any ruder and really pissed me off. n nIs there any security anywhere in this hotel at all? Black bums asking me and my girlfriend if we need any blow or if they can have a cigerette or 5 dollars. GTFOH. Not to mention no one checks your room key going up to the room so anyone who wants to go up to your floor and rob you after they see you get a hand pay can have at it. n nIve also never seen machines so tight in any casino anywhere. But thats my bad luck, table games to, it just wasnt happening. n nIm very glad I only paid 55 a night. I will stay elsewhere unless they offer me a free room. n nSome things we did enjoy were earl of sandwich, pf changs happy hour for a late lunch, spice market buffet, the hottie dealers, miracle mile, pbr rock bar and grill.",1
"Best wood burning gourmet pizza ever! We loved it and our kids loved it! Fresh ingredient and the crust is cooked to perfection, not too thin and too deep. We spoke to the chef and he is super nice and friendly and it was really quick! Love the little restaurant but it is small and it gets packed during dinner time. Lunch was great and their lunch prices can't be beat!",2
"I bought a Livingsocial deal for Mert's. The place is crowed for brunch on Sat. We were quickly seated. The cornbreads were very delicious and warm. Don't take the cornbread to go because it isn't that good when it is a take out. I got the salmon cake with two sides mac and cheese and mash potatoe with gravy. The side orders were good sizes. They weren't stingy on the gravy enough for your mash potatoe. My dad had the catfish and the beef ribs. The beef ribs were good but catfish was more on the fishy side. Overall, we enjoyed Mert's. The staffs were all very friendly.The quarter leg was also good. The nice young lady who waited on us was fast and nice. It was a busy day and she even remembered to refill my drink. If you work at downtown, give Mert's a try.",2
"Meh. this place used to be JJ's Top of the Swamp and has since been recently remodeled. My sister and I thought we would check it out for lunch. nAtmosphere. typical bar. nothing really noteworthy. Seems like maybe they are still in midst of the remodel. sister noticed the floor near the ladies restroom seemed a bit suspect and in need of some repair. The food prices seemed reasonable, However once again. nothing really too noticeable about the menu typical deep fry bar fare. My sister got the blackened chicken melt. which she said was pretty good. I ordered the Yeti burger. yes that is correct.Yeti. It could be pretty good. The waitress asked how I would like it prepared. I am at a loss as to why she asked when the burger came out over well done and dry. It also comes with a fried egg. well. a solid fried egg. Our waitress was nice and seemed amiable. Maybe they are still working stuff out with the menu or the cook was having an off day. nHonestly, I probably won't go back as there really wasn't anything to make this place a destination. I hope your experience is a bit better than ours.",1
"I heart this place! The Fitness Spa facility is amazing! n nI took a spin class in the morning and made a massage appointment for the afternoon. n nMy masseuse was great! She didn't entirely get rid of my knots it will take MANY appointments to get rid of them , but I did feel relaxed and pampered. I have the urge to come back here after my marathon . hmm, we'll see. n nOne thing I absolutely loved was this room called the Crystal Room. It's similar to a regular sauna, but much, much, much more HOTTER. I believe I read that the humidity is at 95 . While sitting in there, I hear a hissing sound and it heats up the room. Within 2 minutes you are perspiring! I wonder how much weight I can lose sitting in that room?! n nTo rinse off, their products are wonderful too. I recommend this place to anyone who loves to pampered. OR if you're like me who doesn't gamble in the casino, the Canyon Ranch Spa is the place to be for hours and hours! n nBTW, they accept SpaFinder gift cards!",2
Great food! Got pad see ew and the portion was so generous. Friends got panang curry and tom yum soup and loved the powerful flavor of their dishes. Would come again.,2

"Though I generally don't put much stock in Yelp reviews, I may need to reconsider after my trip to Champaign Dental Group. n nBackground information I have severe anxiety when it comes to going to the dentist and, as such, am unlikely to book an appointment unless I am in a considerable amount of pain hence my booking this appointment, despite being terrified . n nEverything started off well I called and was given a same day appointment, and one of the dental hygienists even called me back and told me I could come in early if I so chose. When I got there, the receptionists and hygienists were polite and professional I explained my dental related issues, and they seemed both empathic and understanding. n nThen, Dr. Colin came in. Upon seeing that I was noticeably anxious upset and struggling to articulate myself, he immediately said ""okay, refer her to Dr. Escobar. "" I was flabbergasted. Never before have I been treated so poorly by someone who was supposed to HELP me. If you're unable or unwilling to at least feign empathy with your patients who are extremely anxious terrified to go to the dentist in the first place, you should probably rethink your occupation. It would greatly behoove Dr. Colin to learn an iota of compassion and understanding. Like I said, I have never been treated so poorly by someone who is ostensibly a professional. Shame on you, Dr. Colin!",1
"The food is edible, but that's about it. The prices are also typical for the strip, 15 for an omelet or scramble at breakfast.",1
probably one of the worst pedis. she cut my big toe nail too short. it bled a little,1
"Chompies is always a nice treat for me, any time of the day. I finally made it over to this location and carried out a sandwich on Sunday. I thought the service was a little slow here, and I don't know if its always that way, or just the fact that I was in there on a Sunday night. So, they lost a point for making me wait, and wait, and wait some more. n nI'll say this. I like Chompies. I don't think thier bad. But, for some reason, I don't think thier all that and a bag of chips. I think thier the best Arizona can do for good traditional Jewish food. I would take my parents here in a heartbeat, being the Jewish girl that I am. And belive me, I grew up eating all this stuff and more, so I can tell you that I am a pretty good judge. I think this is the best the Valley has to offer so far, for being close to Jew food. I just know its not the BEST Jew food I have sunk my teeth into.",2
What a joke this is a strip club? It's close to the worst strip club I've ever been to. I'm pretty sure I would have had a better time thrown money at hookers for nothing on Van Buern and driving off and watching them fight over the money. The Great Alaskan Bush Company is the only place I'll try or go to next time I'm in the Phx area! This place is way over crowded and I have no Idea why.,1
"I have to agree with most. Fly another airline. This sucks. n ncrummy seating, delays, they nickel and dime you. n nfly southwest if their is an option.",1
"I loved this place. it was moderately priced, very cute and perfect for a place to crash after a night of drinking in Scottsdale for my birthday. We were able to walk back to a very well lit hotel that was adorable and comfortable. The use of Aveda products was a plus and the bath robe the most important part was extremely comfortable. The staff pleasant and check in check out was quick and easy. I would definitely stay there again.",2
"Very friendly staff. I had a Mai Tai. which was very good. sometimes they are too sweet but this one was perfect! For appetizers we ordered the ahi sashimi and spicy seaweed salad. The salad had a nice kick and the ahi was awesome. so good we had another order of it. It was better than any I have had at a sushi place recently. nFor dinner we had the butterfish pan fried with a mushroom sauce, rice and subsituted sauteed spinach for slaw. very yummy and not over cooked. also had the ribs. pretty good too. nThe patio had a nice atmosphere and misters nGreat experience all the way around.",2
"dont know what all the hype is about. very underwhelmed with this place. having no place to get some fresh air felt very claustrophobic. felt like a carbon copy of xs but with no outdoor area. and drinks are stupiddddd expensive, sorry ladies.",1
"Sisig on a truck. OMG Yum ! nWas heading home the other day and saw them parked at the Pawn Shop on Rancho and Bonanza. Read somewhere that they had Sisig and I had to stop in and give it a try. nI always love the look I get when I order sisig from somewhere because culturally it's not mainstream but honestly everyone should give it a try at least once! nWe got an order of Lumpia which were meaty and not overly greasy with the perfect amount of crunch to the rolls. nTwo orders of the sizzling sisig that had the perfect amount of heat, cheeky crunch and lemon. nThe owner brought us out a few of his Shumai to try too and WOW. Those were spot on. nI have tried the Sisig at almost all of the Filipino places in town and even though I am a die hard Cafe Moda fan this place rocks, plus I don't have to listen to the crappy Karaoke to get a decent plate of food. Looking forward to you guys taking off, your doing a great job so far and I look forward to catching you guys on a street again soon.",2
"I can't comment on any of the regular menu food. I came for a specific purpose frozen hot chocolate! I was not disappointed. We got it to go and drank it on the nice, warm patio outside. It was fantastic. The place seems like it could get fairly busy. The outside line that we were in moved fairly quickly. The staff wasn't terribly friendly, but I think their main focus was efficiency. I will definitely be back.",2
"Amazing food. The vegetarian mini tacos are to live for! And if you aren't vegetarian, the buttermilk chicken melts in your mouth. n nGreat service depends on what server you get. 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service the best server works at the bar most nights, I can't recall his name, sorry! ",2
I love coming here for brunch they have the best protein pancakes and you can add fruit to them. yum heaven! They have a huge menu so sometimes it takes a while to decide I think that's my only issue is there are so many choices. but I'm really not complaining. The prices are very fair and the food is really good as well as the service. If coming here on weekends be prepared to wait but totally worth it in my opinion!,2

"Came here for lunch today. Nice sports bar with lots of TV's. Tables that are ""meal "" or ""restaurant "" friendly so it's great even if you aren't a sports fan. Service was good from the hostess to the waitresses. Menu had lots of choices almost too many. n nThe big score was the food! I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the blackens chicken Alfredo and it was awesome! It came with thin cheese toast that was amazing. I had a late breakfast so I was full half way through but just couldn't stop eating it. The waitress went to get me a to go box and by the time she returned I finished it. My friend ordered the pastrami slides and fries both were great! Sliders where choc full o meat and cheese and the fries where slightly larger than regular fries but not steal fries. They were cooked to perfection. n nLike I said I was pleasantly surprised. If they can kill it on every dish in their menu I'd have to say ""hats off "" to the cooks chefs!",2
The best Five Guys Burgers I have ever been too! The crew is alive and the store is very clean. I recommend Five Guys to everyone! By far the best burger in town. The fries are delicious I love that extra scoop! The all the way bacon burger is so good! You must try this place!,2
"Good prices, low key atmosphere. Homemade chips are very addicting! Try the Jordan burger, it's absolutely my fav. Great for lunch. Overall the best bar food in Madison. Can be really crowded for games and the parking is mostly street. Also great Friday fish fry.",2
"UGH. snore. i felt like i was in someone's poorly post modern decorated living room. really nothing to see here. crowd is blah and there was NO LINE at all, not even guys. bad sign. the palms needs to reevaluate their clubs lounges bars because at this point the competition has way too much on them.",1
"Don't be fooled by the location in a strip mall. Go there. It's some of the best food I've had in Phoenix. We showed up with 6 people and no reservation. No problem! It's clearly a place with a solid base of regulars, as evidenced by the gregarious interaction between the staff and patrons. Two of the people in our party had not been to the new location since they moved from Bell Rd., and so were hoping it was still as good as it used to be, and it did not disappoint! My father ordered veal can't remember honestly if it was parm or marsala , and said it was some of the best he had ever tasted. Three of us ordered the Pollo Piemontese and LOVED it. Reasonably priced, beautifully presented, and the staff is top notch. We were so full from dinner that we declined dessert, and as a treat the owner sent over an after dinner aperitif on the house. You don't get treated like that every day, now do you? I'll be back next time i'm in Phoenix, you can count on that.",2
"The martini was waterly. I orderd ""up "", I had to pay 2.50 extra for ""up "". nI give 2 stars for nice atmosphere only. The location is not good sitting in the back of a shopping center.",1
"This place is cheaper than other theaters, and that is the only positive thing. Every time I have been here there is an issue with the sound. The sound is either very very low or not present at all during the previews. This really irks the crap out of me. I really like to see what new movies are coming out. Every time I have complained I am told that the sound will be fine once the movie starts, not OK, and because of it I would rather spend a little more somewhere else!",1
"Awesome! Friendly, accommodating, and professional. Not only got us right in the club, but stayed close by all night in case we needed something to ensure a great time. Thanks for a fun night!",2
This is the worst property management company ever. Dont deal with any of them! they will take your money and take advanatage. I have been cheated of my money and this company needs to be reported to the POLICE. They are running a scam by inflicting wrongful claims. I have had 4 of my friends cheated by this business as well. my advice STAY AWAY!.,1
"This dining experience was absolutely atrocious due to the service and ambiance. Definitely not a destination dining spot. If your next stop after Grotto is within walking distance, fine, but it's certainly not worth getting in a cab and driving downtown from the LV strip. n nIt literally took 35 minutes to receive our fried calamari appetizer unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait since the dish was overcooked rubbery and extremely salty. n nFor my entree, I ordered the Veal Kickerillo. The menu description read Parmesan crusted scaloppine with mushrooms a touch of lemon served with fettuccine Alfredo. What I received was 4 small and paper thin medallions all the exact same size with 1 slice of a mushroom on top. I honestly believe there was more breading than veal. n nThe highlight of the evening was when a homeless women approached our table for money. Right in the middle of the dining room.",1
So done with this place! Just has progressively got worse and worse! Since when do you put sauce on a pizza that's made for pasta? Chunky sauce? Wings were dry and over cooked almost chocked on them! Got two pizzas one had a ton of cheese on it compared to the other one. That was my issues with this place never know what your gonna get! After tonight I know they will never get another dime of my money and thank god I won't get awful food from this place!,1
"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The rooms are awesome, my views from high floors and lowers floors are always stunning. The rooms are always clean, they don't smell of smoke at all except when you start smoking in the smoking rooms of course. The regular rooms are so spacious and comfortable even with a regular room, sleeps 4 comfortably with a king bed and pull out sofabed, a room with 2 beds sleeps 6! They have a tv in the bathroom, one in front of the bed and another in the sitting area. I love the decor and colors used in this hotel. I can't seem to stay anywhere else when it comes to hotel choice.",2
"I didn't have a drink at the bar, but one look around told me I would love this place as a bar. It's just the kind of dusty , down to earth, sparsely filled place I like getting my drink on at and I will surely be back to sit at the bar and slow life down for awhile and have a brew. It should be also be noted that I have now found a new location to procure 16oz cans! n nI stopped in on my half hour lunch break and ordered a roast beef sandwich. n nThe roast beef was warmed which I wasn't expecting. For me I like my roast beef served with cheddar cheese.cheddar cheese isn't exotic.but for some reason Sammy's doesn't have cheddar frown.and I requested brown mustard none of that either. n nSo what I got was meat, lettuce and tomato with a large drink the total for my sammich and drink 8.00. That makes for an expensive lunch. Way more then the 4.85 I'm use to spending on my 6in Italian BMT. n nI'll be updating this once I see how the bartenders get down.but for now 3 stars the sandwich was way to expensive for what it was. No cheddar no 5 stars.",1
"WOW wow WOWwwwww! At first I expected this place to be a grocery store and was a little disappointed at first, but man was I in for a pleasant surprise. This place actually has books! Tons of them! I'm from Bosnia and wasn't familiar with the whole library rent a book concept and at first I was offended that they wouldn't take cash for the books I had chosen! I fought a bit .especially when the worker said to bring them back in 3 weeks! However we worked things out! It's an amazing concept! You get to read a book for free and then take it back and choose a new book! America is so great",2
"Amazing nightclub that everyone wants to be at to the point where you fill like a sardine packed into a can. Drinks are ridiculously expensive and it takes a hour just to get to the bartender. I do have to say that it's a beautiful venue that has multiple levels, but not the best if you just want to go and dance without worrying about being shoved, pushed, or getting into a fight with the girl in front of you.",1
"This place I have wanted to try for weeks.well months.well years. My girlfriend and I went and love a good strip club. The dancers were very friendly and hot. Drinks were a bit overpriced, but it is a strip club so expected. n nHad to work to get a lapdance as nobody approached the couple.that was weird. Usually the dancers at clubs are very friendly, so they should work on that. n nLots of diversity, didn't try the private VIP but it looked worth it.",2
"Let's start off by saying that the name of this restaurant is very befitting of the owner.he is quite greasy looking. If you expect to sit at a normal table on a normal chair, this place is NOT for you. They only have oversized bar tables and 100 pound oversized stools to sit on. These tables and stools are so crammed into this tiny hole of a restaurant honestly, I think the terrace is bigger than the restaurant , that you will probably have to get up every single time the low class asshole of a person at the table next to you goes out to smoke, which in my experience was about 4 times in the course of an hour . If you object as well you should , and don't get up, as was the case, the greasy owner will stare you down for the rest of your meal and talk shit about you in French to the other patrons and waiters. I'm sorry sir, but this is no way to run a restaurant. n nThe food here is actually pretty good, but the atmosphere and owner explain why this place is constantly offering half price deals on Living Social. They probably wont be around much longer. It's almost impossible to hear the person people you are there with, because you're practically sitting at the same table as the people next to you.",1
"Came here on Christmas eve because of all the hype. The price is an upsale restaurant, but the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is like a musty old sports bar. I didnt think anything was great about the place. Reminded me of a cafeteria. There are far better restaurants in the valley for the price.",1
"Best customer service, these days you don't find a company like Smart Security. If you are looking for an alarm for your home, office, or business I wouldn't trust anyone else but Steve Richardson with Smart Security.",2
"Had a craving for pad see ew, surprisingly wasn't on the menu. Had pad thai instead and some soup with shrimp and mushrooms. Food was pretty good and staff was very attentive and friendly , would definately come back again",2
I do not eat sushi but all the ladies I was with wanted it I ordered the teriyaki chicken and a side of rice and a drink.the price was outrageous! 52 The chicken was good but not that good!,1
"Just moved here and got their flyer in the mail. Called for delivery and staff was really curt and rude. said they didn't even have the ingredients for one of their specialty pizzas, and then hung up on me.

Worst service u can ever imagine and what type of Mexican restaurant can't make guacamole because they ran out of tomatos?!?,1
"As far as Jason's Deli goes, it's pretty decent. I would say compared to other deli style restaurants, it's 3 stars. You can enjoy their salad buffet, order a huge spud or they have a variety of sandwiches. Nice place to get something simple and yummy.",2
"What is the point of having a drive thru if it takes 45 minutes to get through a line of 5 cars. At this point I don't even care if the food is AMAZING. If I wanted to spend this much time waiting for my food, I would have gone to a sit down restaurant. The girl at the window did apologize for the wait. But even after I paid I waited another five minutes to get my food. The worst drive through experience I've ever had.",1
"We went to Jasper's Peak courtesy of a Groupon my companion picked up. I'm fairly glad we didn't pay full price considering how disappointed I was with our experience this evening. n nWe ordered the crab dip, the voodoo chicken with added shrimp , and the jambalaya. n nThe crab dip 9 had a nice texture not too wet , but didn't have a distinctive flavor. We doused this liberally with hot sauce, which was a significant improvement. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips, which provided a good contrast with our spiced up version. n nThe voodoo chicken 16 had a delicious smokiness to it, and the shrimp 4 for an additional 4.50 were a nice complement. The jambalaya 16 was weak, thin and not terribly filling. The rice was the best part of the jambalaya as it had time to soak up the sauce, which brings me to my next point. n nThe meats were all nicely done, but it was obvious that they were cooked separately outside of their sauces and assembled later. They were a bit bland unless you were certain that you rolled them about in your sauce. n nThe service could have been significantly better. Our water glasses were often empty for long stretches, and our waitress Rebecca's friendliness seemed forced and artificial. The place was fairly dead, but we weren't checked on until our meals were almost finished. She asked how our food was at that point but didn't even wait for my answer before she walked away. Service was fairly slow throughout the meal, even though I could see our plates waiting on the service counter. n nI wanted to love this place as it is far closer to me than Baby Kay's, but I'm not going to settle for such poor service at this price. n nAlso, the bartender seemed very friendly, guiding the gentleman at the table next to us through a tasting in order for him to make a wine selection. We didn't drink tonight, but I was impressed. n nPros n Quiet. n Large patio area. n Clean. n nCons n No reservation for parties fewer than six. n Service can be spotty.",1

I travel alot and usually enjoy Sticky Fingers. I stopped to take my wife out for lunch and boy were we disappointed. It took a while to get our food. When we did my wife dug into the cup of collards and they were a funky taste like burnt with a hint of kale. Everything seemed overcooked and dry. Even the cole slaw wasnt that good sweet taste. Beans and mac cheeae were pretty good. Very disappointed. because of all the choices we had we picked Sticky Fingers.but probably not next time.,1
"I stopped in for a drink while killing time between some of the other attractions in Star Trek The Experience. n nRomulan Ale is just blue beer. I'd hoped they'd come up with an interesting flavor. Given that the characters in the show defy the law to drink it, you'd think it must taste pretty amazing, but no, it tastes like popular cheap brand name beer you can buy anywhere. n nThe decor isn't pleasant. I'm not sure why anyone would want to sit around with a bunch of lumenglasses everywhere, in a darkish, noisy environment. And it's not like there's a big party all the time either. n nI personally found the guys wandering around in alien costumes pretending to be real aliens to be cheezy.",1
"I took this shuttle again today coming home to Phoenix from San Jose, CA. My car was parked 5 days. Fast pickup at terminal 4, courtesous GOOD driving not trying to text and talk on the phone like other shuttle company drivers think SuperShuttle . No reckless driving thank you. I feel safe. Most parking spaces are covered you can ALWAYS get covered without a reservation or being a special person or pre paid like some lots here. They are wide and big enough for my mini SUV even if a 4x4 parks next to me unlike most of the parking shuttle lots where they're so tiny you hardly have room to park a compact. Service is courteous and efficient. They honor AAA discounts and have a program for free days after so many paid days. But mostly I love the service and the lot. You can get uncovered parking too if you want, but this is AZ and I want covered. I changed after trying others, and parking for 20 years in Deer Valley Parking, changed to Sky Harbor Parking, and it just got terrible. Plus I wanted covered when I wanted it, not when they might have a spare space for me next to Hummer in half my space. I have parked at Blue Sky every time I travel ever since it opened and I love it. Keep doing what you do RIGHT EVERY TIME! nI just came home tonight after 5 days, and I'm leaving again in the morning going to Blue Sky again for 6 days this time.

"This lounge is very comfortable, but it does not have quality food or drinks, so there is no value to the customers. n nIf you are Platinum, it is free to enter, and a nice place to relax. If you are a different level of American Express member, there is a 50 fee. I promise this lounge is not worth that price. n nThere is one dish of salad, and one main course. The main course when I was there was lamb pie, and it looked like it had been sitting there longer than Tom Hanks in The Terminal. Dry, tasteless and inedible. The salad was sitting out so long, I didn't try it. The potatoes were under cooked. n nThe liquor selection is nice for a fraternity house. Bulleit Rye and Red Label Scotch. Yeesh! American Express serves a mixing scotch, not fit for consumption. n nI actually left to use the airport bathroom because it was so dirty when I visited the lounge. There were no magazines or newspapers. n nThese reviews make me think I came at a bad time. But I also felt like I wasted my time and appetite at this lounge. I was quite hungry during my flight, and I'm just a bit surprised American Express puts their name on this.",1
"Enjoyable dinner. It was pretty quiet. I do like that they have the dinning separated from the bar area. The atmosphere was very relaxing and comfortable. It was clean and very nice, definitely not what you would expect when you drive up. n nOur waitress was very attentive. She was never far away and did keep our glasses full. n nThe meal was very tasty. We had the Tips and they were very good. I'm not a huge fan of fries, so I opted for the Lyonnaise Potatoes when were tasty but perhaps a little too mushy for my personal taste. The flavor was good. n nWe may not be a frequent visitor but I'm sure we will return.",2
Rude owners! Wouldn't recommend as they made their paying guest feel uncomfortable and unwelcome!,1
"This location just opened,2nd visit and I give it five stars.The pizza was great, the pretzels have no rival. The Greek salad was loaded with veggies. I know if this kind of quality food continues this place will be a huge hit at Noterra.The service was good my only critique would be don't apologize for a 20 minute wait for pizza what good pizza doesn't take sometime.We look forword to more yummy food.",2
Beers! Holy cow what a selection. Had a Thai chicken pizza and a couple great beers to wash it down. Told the bar tender the things I liked in beer and brought great selections. I might go back tomorrow.,2
"So I will be the first to admit that I am not usually a big barbeque fan. A few years ago I was in Kansas City and even then I was ""Meh "" about the whole thing. Maybe my palate has expanded since then who knows. Either way, when I had a hankering for barbeque today it was a little unexpected to say the least. n nTo be fair, I had been meaning to try Honey Bears since I moved close to it. I had heard how amazing it was, but just had never really been in the mood. Today I gave in and went and I am so glad I did! n nThe service was nice and super fast. I was really surprised by how quickly my food came out. I ordered the 3 sliders, figuring I would have an assortment of tastes in case I picked the wrong thing. All three were really good, but the pork slider was absolutely my favorite. I don't normally like barbeque sauce, because it usually seems too sweet to me. It seemed to me like there might be a little bit of a kick thrown in that kept it from being overly sweet. The sauce paired with the tender juiciness of the pork was completely delectable. Now I know what I will get when I get a barbeque craving and this time it won't be a surprise! ",2
"I just got back to work after eating at Little Hong Kong and I am so happy I found this place. I have worked in the are for 3 years and there are not many places to eat for lunch. n nI enjoyed the Orange Chicken and my friend had the Chicken Chow Mein. Both dishes were big enough to split and very good. We both had enough to take home for lunch tomorrow. Each dish came with Egg Roll, fried wonton, vegetable fried rice and the choice of salad bar or Egg Drop Soup. You can not beat the prices 6.50 each. Also, we were in and out in less then an hour. n nIf you are looking for a clean, friendly enviornment and good food I recommend Little Hong Kong!",2

"My husband and I were looking to bring a friend here yesterday from out of town. I've always been happy with everything I've ordered from Pita Jungle so I knew our friend would enjoy it. We started off with the cilantro jalapeno hummus which was amazing, and they brought us extra pitas as well since there were three of us. nI went for the falafel pita, which had a wonderful crunch and was conveniently wrapped in tinfoil so as not to fall apart while eating. I would have loved a bit more tahini sauce as it was a little dry. My husband ordered the fatoosh salad which was enough for two huge servings and had wonderful crunchy pita chips alongside. Our friend ordered the chicken tiki masala and he finished his whole plate in no time. nOur server kept our waters filled, the vibe is always cool, no nonsense, healthy, good food. I also like how you can just go casual sometimes it's nice to just stop your weekend yardwork or housekeeping and grab a good, healthy meal without having to get all dressed up. Most casual, convenient fast food is not stuff I want to eat!",2
"I have been wanting to eat at Olives for longer than I can recall. Having finally tried it, I was disappointed to say the least. You can't argue with the great location and view. The service was good, food and drinks were alright, but the main course was awful. I ordered the Sweet Pea Agnotti, it sounded fabulous from the menu, but when it arrived it was not at all what I was expecting. It was covered in mushrooms, and I am not a fan. The flavor itself was not good and very very salty. I ate about 2 bites, paid my bill and left quickly. I would go back for drinks only. I did not have dessert so I cannot comment on that part of the meal. n nSorry guys, not worth it.",1
"This restaurant serves Szechwan and Mandarin cuisine. We each started off with a cup of corn and chicken soup that turned out to be egg drop soup with a few kernels of corn tossed in for good measure. We shared entrees of shrimp lo mein and spicy chicken with peppers. Neither dish scaled any culinary heights, but at least I was able to use a 20 off coupon printed off the LVRJ website to ease my disappointmen",1
"I'm happy that I got a promo price on these tickets as my hubby and I left far less than pleased. This is the final cirque show that we wanted to see in Vegas have been to Ka, Zumanity and Mystere. Have no interest in Love or Criss Angel and since I was told that it was the best of all the cirque shows I was excited to leave this one for last. n nWell. I didn't get it. I know that the story lines of the cirque shows can be complicated but not my husband, nor myself could makes heads or tails of this one. Besides the lack of storyline, my husband told me afterward that he actually nodded off twice! I was a bit relieved because I thought it was just me who was having trouble staying awake. n nThe diving was the best part of the show. The weird French Canadian clowns were the worst part. If you haven't seen KA yet, go there instead of this one.",1
Met my friend for lunch on a weekday around noon. Hostess was attentive and friendly sat me where I could see my friend arriving. We both order the soup and salad all you can eat and overall the service was okay. When we asked for more soup she seemed as if we were bothering her. At end of lunch she actually put our mints on top of the check presenter and tossed the mints on to the table. I was very surprised and shocked. nI will say the food as usual is very good and truly enjoyed the food. However service was lacking.,1
"The ""Chinese "" food at Manchu Wok is disgusting. If I could give zero stars, I would. This swill General Tso's chicken was soft and reminded me of GLUTEN was so absurdly bad that I couldn't finish it, and my friends know I can eat ANYTHING. The lo mein was tasteless. It was ""Panda Express "" expensive, but not remotely as tasty. n nI ate here when I was semi stranded at the Charlotte Douglas airport overnight the only positive was that the meal was comped by the airline. n nEverytime you eat there, God kills a kitten. Oh, and Manchu Wok profits. Avoid this place.",1
"RIP CLOSED FOREVER! n nThe cool illuminated disco floor was destroyed by a flying keg after the fire marshall showed up at 1 30 and shut it down a half hour before closing time. n nYes, I have a photo. Added to the gallery above n nFaux Show is supposedly moving to a new location.",2
"Service is very slow. nThe menu doesn't explain any of the items and out waitress didn't know any of the ingredients. The salad. Only. Had 3 ingredients. All of which were not worth 15 n nWe ended up leaving after there was no good vegaterian options and no solution was offered. n nWhen we said we're were going to leave our server did Zero to change our minds. n nI give it one star because we did get chips and Salsa and the Salsa was good. The chips were not so great. n nI would definitely never recommend this over priced place to anyone. Walk down the road to The yard house for a great menu, healthy options and 150 beer selection. And better prices.",1
"Modern Warfair 3 Launch. they took care of everyone in line and there were 600 people there. Kudos GameStop. Kudos. n nAnd there was this awesome guy named Brett, I'm pretty sure? He was really helpful and friendly. n n5 stars.",2

"I stayed at the Clarendon from Thursday, February 4th to Monday, February 8th. Although my reservations had been made through a large travel firm, I was booked by the large firm into an incorrect type of room. The staff at the Clarendon, both the desk clerks and the maids, were extremely helpful and friendly. They moved me to the room of my choice with no problem. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the rooms had comfy and hip furnishings. nI spent a lot of time by the gorgeous pool LOVE that waterwall! and at the rooftop bar. The restaurant in the hotel is fabulous! nI will definitely stay there again but I'll book directly next time since the Clarendon will match any on line offers.",2
"I hate this place so much I am standing in their great wall of china length line as I am writing this review. I am totally hating on myself for not reading the reviews before but I never knew this kind of shit existed. I mean COME ON how do you have 3 people behind the counter when nearly all the people inside the building are standing in front of dollar?!?!? I literally moved up about five feet it the past forty five minutes.that's about a foot a minute. Everyone looks SO miserable but i still feel more sorry for myself. n nDollar express is seriously ruining my trip and I can't even cancel it because I booked them through hotwire.com. To conclude, this place sucks!",1
Best Pho in Begas! Far better than the one in Chinatown! The broth is soo comforting! We always get the combo meat on he outside! The owner and the wait staff are sooo gracious! It's quite a drive out but it is soo worth it! A must to get your pho craving fixed!,2
"I LOVE the BJ's in Desert Ridge, where I used to live, but the service at this location is not super awesome. There is one server here I like who transfered from the Desert Ridge location, I believe her name is Julia, but other than that I have not been impressed. I seem to get the same server every time I go there and she just always seems annoyed to serve me. She and the bartender didn't know what a cadillac margarita was? Just seemed weird to me.",1
"I'm not one that treats myself to get my hair done as much as I should. n nHaving said that, since I'm incapable to do anything with my own hair except throw it in a ponytail, I really wanted something 'fancy' to go to the AFAN Black White party that night. I just so happened to look at Groupon NOW and there was an option for a wash and blowout. Perfect, as I don't even own a functional blow dryer. n nAnyway, I got there and Aimee was the gal that was going to work her magic. She asked if I'd like a trim to my ends as well, which was great because I needed one badly but didn't want to put her behind schedule she had a wedding to go to that evening. She happily did a trim to my nasty split ends before asking what the occasion was in which I needed a blow out. I told her about the AFAN party that night at the Hard Rock, and she immediately asked if I'd like to have curls instead. Fantastic! Once again, if she had the time to do so. n nShe worked her magic and my hair looked great! The haircut and curls were just at 50 which is a great deal in my opinion. Because I did not end up using my Groupon NOW! deal, Groupon refunded me. Seriously though 12 bucks on Groupon for a wash and blowout is amazing! I may have to look again 'just because'. n nMy curls held all night, and I was mostly outdoors in 90 degree weather next to a pool. For this price and for the friendly service, I am definitely going to treat myself more often, and will definitely be back.",2
Yes folks! This is the place to go for the alcohol when you are in Vegas Baby! Its cheap.strong.tasty and lots and lots of choices. n nThey serve margaritas.8 or so flavors .all pretty tasty.12 oz is about 8 bucks.long yard stick is about 17 bucks.lasted me all night! The Strawberry flavor and bellini is sweet and good. For a stronger.bit more sour drink.try the 190 octane cat 5 hurricane. You could even add a small shot they call it a shot but my curious self went home and measured.its only filled about 1 3 of a shot glass for a buck! Great deal. nJell O shots are 1.Refills are discounted if you have one of their special cups. n nTo get drunk with friends.have a good time walking on the strip.this place is great. I found this one in MGM near self parking to be strong.the one in Planet hollywood Near Earl's of sandwich which is close to the entrance off of the strip.you just have to walk a little further in and ask someone isn't as strong but good.and Imperial palace to be really strong. n nDrink away!,2
"ARCHIES IS NOT A JEWISH DELI. Anyone who thinks it is has never been to a real Jewish deli.period. I have been to Archies a handful of times. I can honestly say it has gone severely down hill. The food was ummmm.not good. Service was so so at best. Archies sucks and that is down from ugggh. The matzoh ball soup is a crime to matzoh ball soup. The pastrami and corned beef was really bland.and tasteless. it would be the laughing stock of ""delis "" for about 4 days until it closed in a Jewish neighborhood. Do not kid yourself.",1
"We came in on a Thursday night as DJs in a suite. Pulled in to valet and we were unloading our equipment. Valet gave us a ticket and bellhop came over and asked if we need help up to a room. We accepted and gave him a 10 tip for helping us out. He responded by saying ""I charge 20 "". We have performed DJ services in almost every casino on the strip and utilized this service and never once did a bellhop say ""I charge 20 "" as they work on tips. After we are done in the suite the bellhop comes back and WE LOAD our equipment and he different bellhop says ""I charge 20 "". At that point we are beyond livid. I go down to the front desk and ask to talk to a manager. The guy behind the counter asks if there is anything he can help me with and I asked again to speak with a manager. He said he needed to know what it was pertaining to in order to fulfill that request so I told him. I also let him know that neither bellhop would provide me with a receipt. He left the counter came back in 3 minutes and explained that it is their policy to charge 20. I asked him for a receipt and again to talk to a manager. He was unable to give me a receipt and he would not go back and grab the manager. At that time another bellhop came over and the man behind the desk told him the situation. He asked the bellhop to give me a receipt and the bellhop said that they couldn't. At that point I wanted to go home, it was late. We left and as we were waiting for valet I decided to try again and ask the bellhop for a receipt. He said he could write something down on a piece of paper but that was the best they could do. SERIOUSLY? If this is a legitimate charge then it would be in your system and you could give me a receipt. What if I used a credit or debit card? How would you charge it? I called the next day to speak to a manager. Again, I get a girl at the front desk and I had to provide all the information AGAIN before she would let me speak to a manager. She then puts me on hold and comes back on and said it was infact their policy. STILL NO MANAGER! I direct message the Palms on their facebook asking why I am unable to speak to a manager. 3 days later.THEY HAVEN'T ANSWERED ME, I STILL HAVE NOT SPOKE TO A MANAGER AND WE STILL HAVE NO RECEIPT. Outcome is simple, we were hustled and the customer service was horrific. I will never step foot in this place again or spend another dollar there. No wonder all your clubs are closing and your casino was empty. Poor customer service from your staff, no acknowledgment from management but your bellhops are 40 richer.",1
"Went here for a quick bite with family before a play at Phoenix Theater. I was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food, but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try. On the way to our booth, we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the not busy at all waitstaff hadn't cleaned it up yet. The food was on the high side of ""just OK. "" The malt, ice cream soda, and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic. But, before the final curtain of the show, the cramping began for what would be a 24 hour bout of food poisoning traced back by process of elimination to McAlpines chicken salad. I suppose if you want a delicious soda fountain treat, this is your place. If you want to eat diner food without getting sick, go somewhere else.",1
Love this place. Never have I ever went in their once and not been satisfied. Great service. Amazing food. Amazing prices. Especially their happy hour,2
"The food tasted the same as Chipotle back in my home state, so it was consistent. This Chipotle also shares the same establishment with Panda Express and pizza place. It's very popular can get loud but the service is quick. You may have to wait a little to find a seat because you're sharing with the other restaurant patrons too. They don't have large tables. Most sit 4 at most. This Chipotle also allows you to order ahead for large groups.",2
Terrible. Sticky interior. Incorrect order. Orange chicken that tasted like they used a ketchup glaze. Kung pao chicken was all the right ingredients just no flavor or spice. I didn't finish my egg roll. Crab puffs were the best part of the meal. Will not go back.,1
"Worst. Company. Ever. If you are thinking about renting a property managed by WI Mngmt co, think again. In fact, RUN! It would takes multiple to pages to write about our awful experience renting an apartment with this company, so I will just say do not rent from them or you will regret it. Their customer service is horrible, practically non existent. They do not give a crap about their renters. They can not do anything right or deliver on any promises. I shriek when I hear their name.",1
"This Inn is really called the Inn at Eagle Mountain. We stayed there weekend and were blown away by how beautiful this place was. Our room was large we got the suite and really comfortable. The view was beautiful. At night, it is so quiet you can hear your heart beat. In the morning, watching the sunrise over the mountains is spectacular. And best of all, it was REALLY reasonable pricing. Go figgur. And the service and support staff were very helpful and pleasant. Great place!",2
"We used to go to Thai BBQ when we first moved to Vegas 4 years ago. The food then was soo good flavorful and just delicious. We always used to take visitors here and they used to rave about it as much as did. If i was writing this review back then, I would have easily given it 5 stars. n nAs for the service, we have always been treated kindly there. The waiters are always soft spoken and very friendly. I don't have much to say about the place itself its not new, but its not dirty or anything. The prices were also reasonable for what you get. n n And here's the but. But the past couple times we've been, the food quality has changed. We always get the same thing the beef satay dinner and pad thai. Last couple times we went, the meat was bland and missing all the flavor! It didn't taste like they marinated it at all! The shrimp in the fried rice was undercooked we had to send it back. The pad thai was way too saucy for my liking it reminded me of the instant pad thai that you can make at home. The quality of the food has just changed. Maybe they got a different cook I'm not sure. All I know is that its just not what it used to be. n nUnfortunately, after two bad experiences in a row, we're going to have to skip Thai BBQ from now on.",1
"Gosh, I love Woodman's. It's my no frills, cheaper than cheap but you can still find anything everything, favorite liquor section and worth the drive to the far east side grocery. My family has been going here since the dawn of time, and I follow suit whenever I'm back in town. n nOn an enchilada mission we were able to find loads of tomatillos, tortillas, queso fresco and a few more essentials for under 30. Seriously. Our shopping cart was full and they're generous with space here . Sure, the produce section requires picking over a few things, and we couldn't quite find the scallions that day, but it's a minor inconvenience I'm willing to endure for friendly service, low prices and being able to patronize a local employee owned business. n nSee you next time!",2
I have had the pizza here a few times when I come from NY to visit my parents. It's pretty good pizza. I just ate there tonight though and it was fantastic. Perfectly crisp and flavorful. The restaurant is clean and the owners servers are very nice. Overall a good choice for a small pizza place,2
"Hmmm.the Wyndham Grand. This hotel is like one of the stars of the old 90s 90210 series. Once, it was the toast of the town. It was good looking and hip. Everyone liked you. Gradually, age catches up to you. There are new, younger, better looking kids in town. You get a face lift but you still can't undo the ravages of time. n nFirst off, the hotel has a GREAT location for Pirates and Steeler games. You can walk to either one in about ten minutes. The room was decent. It had been updated with new items and the bed was comfortable. However, close inspection shows it is still an old hotel. The carpet was worn. The walls are paper thin. The occasional water mark on the wall. The new flat screen HDTV gets non HD channels and some of the channels only appear at certain times. Most importantly, any time the AC kicked on, the room smelled musty. n nThey were still in the midst of redesigning the hotel bar area and cleaning the exterior. I am sure it will give a little bit more life into the ole Grand but, while all that is going on, the areas are closed and it's hard to act like a 4 star hotel when the Hyatt Place across the river has better amenities. n nOh yeah, how do you advertise you have free internet in the whole hotel but, when I need to print my tickets and I go the business center, you want to charge me 3 to get online to do it?! n nThe Wyndham is a hotel I wasn't angry with when I checked out but I did think to myself ""I wouldn't stay here again "".",1
"Love, love, love Fez. n nThe food is delicious, the drinks are yummy, and the scene is ferosh. n nThe only complaint is that the wait staff is very hit or miss. The first two times I came here we had very inattentive servers the ""it takes twenty minutes to get a greeting and our drink order in "" kind. but ever since we have had nothing but phenomenal service. n nI especially love coming here during happy hour for discounted, delicious drinks and can have a phenomenal meal for under 20! n nGive Fez a try you won't be disappointed.",2

"This was the second time I have been here to pick up some takeout since it's right around the corner, but will never be coming back.

Had I seen that I would never have set foot near this place. Beware!",1
"Probably one of the better deals in Vegas to get messed up fast and semi cheap in my opinion. 35 for 100 oz of alcohol slurpee which seems good to me. 190 octane with 2 4 extra shots of everclear is the way to go, especially when the shots are only 1 extra each. Orange gets tiring fast though so it is good to mix it with some cat 5 hurricane or try the bloody smurf n nthought i would add this in, price wise, fat tuesday is also cheaper than most other places like it on the strip as far as straight up price numbers go, but also, you get the best bang for the buck in my personal opinion because the slushy already has alcohol mixed into it not sure how much, but it seems to be a decent amount rather than places like lime ice that pour in a couple shots, then fill with slushy, then a couple more shots, then slushy till you have your ""x "" amount of shots i know the 100oz at lime ice has 8 shots in it ",2
Terrible sound here,1
"bad service , understaffed . decent food",1
"I was in desperate need to have my hair done last minute. I went to my trusty Yelp. And read reviews on this place.I called and explained my issue, and they got me in right away. Ok first let me say. I was a tad bit taken back by a review. When the first sentence begins with ""I have nothing against piercings or tattoos "" then goes on to bash all the girls who work there along with the rest of the establishment. Your comment is Void. Yes these girls had tattoos and piercings. But SCARY? Are you KIDDING ME? They were GORGEOUS! I kid you not. Every single girl was smiling. Enjoying their job and their clients.I was promptly greeted along with every other person who walked in. I loved the products! In fact I asked what she was using and purchased the whole lot! I had an idea in my head on how I wanted my hair to look for the evening. We are all human and not mind readers. Unless you have a super power and I VOICED what I was thinking as my hair was being done. And after it was done I wanted a few things different. And I voiced it. And she made it happen! These are professionals. It's ok to tell them nicely if you want something different. Of course we were talking and laughing the whole time. I didn't need to TRY to ask nicely. These girls make you feel as if you are old friends. I never understand when I read reviews about ""not being happy with the look "" lol well did u tell them? Anyways. I'm extremely in love with this place! It makes me proud that they DO hire girls with tattoos and piercings and allow them to express their individuality with out prejudice. Another thing which impressed me. Was the impeccable service. I felt VIP even the owner was very active in the business. She made sure I was comfortable, enjoying myself and was happy with my service. Yeah I came back 2 days later for a massage and facial. Dear gawd I'm addicted now! But . The prices are so awesome I CAN feed my addiction!",2

"I had the fried catfish which was great. The fish was moist and flaky and had a nice cornmeal crunchy exterior. The wife had a barbecue chicken sandwich which was terrible. It was really tough and stringy, way overcooked. n nWe had a large party and they were unwilling to split up the check which was a pain. Everyone was digging out cash or feeling uncomfortable to put it on their card. They had live music playing which we enjoyed, and even a small dance floor for some to go out to. n nOverall it was an inconsistent experience with some high points and low points.",1
"I went to eat here on the opening weekend. n nThe wait to eat here was about a good 20 30 minutes. It was expected on the opening weekend. n nOur server was the main problem here. He constantly would forget things we requested. Also, it seemed like he forgot about our table. It took 15 minutes to get a refill. It took another 15 minutes to get a side of horseradish. It took 30 minutes to get our bill. It took another 30 minutes for him to charge our bill. n nThe food itself was actually pretty decent for a casino cafe. I had the chicken ciabatta with a cup of french onion soup. Presentation on the dishes was also more than you'd expect from a cafe. Typical meals range from 8 15 n nOverall, the whole cafe experience was 2 hours. I'd expect to be in and out in less than half the time, since we all just ordered sandwiches. We got to our table at 10pm, left it at midnight. n nDecent food, atrocious service.",1
"I beg you please.please.please don't go here. Unless you enjoy meat that's been cooked to death and you consider grease a condiment. I use to work down the street from this location and literally swerved across three lanes when I saw that one magical word that gives me a raging hunger hard on every time I see it.TAQUERIA. I walked in and ordered three tacos. 1 Asada, 1 Pastor, and 1 Lengua. All were terrible. The lengua had an indescribable funk to it. The asada was good, well that is if you like chewing on a leathery horse dong that's been baking in the senora sun. The pastor sucked and everything was soaking in greasy diarrhea sauce. So if your jonesen for a leathery horse dong soaked in diarrhea sauce you'll love this place, if not you will be severely disappointed. THIS PLACE SUCKS.",1
"We went here on a Saturday for a friend's birthday supper. She had made reservations 2 3 weeks in advance for a group of 25 for 9pm. She was given a long speech about having everyone there on time otherwise her reservation would be given away. All 25 of us showed up by 8 50, but the hostess refused to seat us and she made a big stink about us blocking the entrance way which, mind you, is really small . So she shooed some of us outside, and was quite rude and hostile. The birthday girl requested to speak to the manager because this was just ridiculous the manager didn't seem too bothered for being a hypocrite and had us wait until about 9 20 to be seated. Their justification was that she had made the reservation for 22 people, not 25 and it was so much harder to find an extra table to accommodate the extra guests. n nFinally being seated, our orders were only taken at about 9 50 we were given bread to munch on, but in contrary to other reviews, it was cold and a little stale. Our waiter and waitress were nice, which was probably the only reason why I'm giving this an extra star. I ordered the Italian salad and fried calamari as my entree. We only ended up being served at after 11, and unfortunately for one of our party members, he was only served going on 11 30 because of an apparent order mix up he was compensated with a free dessert only after having pressed the waitress for one. Prices are high for the quality of food it wasn't terrible, but it doesn't stand out in my mind as amazing. For dessert, my boyfriend Danny and I shared creme brul u00e9e, which was pretty good, but again not OMG amazing. n nNot too long after finishing our meal and enjoying the rest of our alcohol, a manager I'm assuming came around, and without any tact or manners, said he was closing the doors in 5 minutes and we had to get out. Quite frankly, the experience left something to be desired. I will not be coming back here because they seem to lack the basics of customer service, and the food isn't anything to write home about.",1
"This is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at. The service is slow, the staff is rude and the food is overpriced. Do not waste your time or money here.",1
"We have been to this location on about 3 or 4 occasions and have never had a bad experience. The servers are always friendly. n nI had the steak and lobster special, the outback steak was cooked medium and was very tender and tasted excellent. The lobster was steamed and stuck to the shell a little bit, but once i got it loose, it tasted good with butter. Not bad for 16.99. n nWe will continue to eat at Outback on occasion.",2
"Went for lunch. There was only another table occupied. It smelled strongly of old fried food. Ordered some rolls and a miso soup. The soup was warm not hot, the rolls were just ok. Service was good. Not a place that I'll get out of my way to go. 2.5 ",1
Very disappointing! The service was really mediocre. The meat was undercooked we asked for medium rare . Had a pannocota for dessert which was really average too. This place is definitely overrated! If you're looking for a great French like brasserie go to Holder on McGill st. The Brasserie T doesn't hold a candle on Holder!,1
My buds and I stumbled literally upon this cool find inside the MGM Grand. The three of us were all very happy with our personal pies. Very unique thin crust and cheap for the strip 12 bucks. Great find.,2
"A MUST VISIT when in the East End of Pittsburgh. The cider selection is quite large, more than you can count on two hands. But fear not, sampling is required anyhow if you're going to buy two bottles. Remember to wash and keep these for return visits, it save you 25 of the original cost. n nThe varieties are quite drastically different from one another, so there truly is something for everyone. And the selections are constantly changing. This place is so good at what they do that they can hardly keep up with the demand. n nDon't forget to buy some sorbet, delicious AND alcoholic!",2
"We stopped in here to meet friends for dinner and cocktails. They were a little late so we ordered the tuna for an appetizer and wine and beer. The tuna appetizer was not that tasty and the wine wasnt really that good either. I just didnt like the vibe in this place so I talked them in to going to Texas De Brazil instead for dinner. I would never go back here. It is inexpensive though, thats the only good thing.",1
"My son and I had lunch here last Friday, June 7. He had the eat all you can sushi and before sleeping that night, he vomitted once and all throughout the night, probably vomitted about 8 more times that finally ended in him ending up in the emergency room of Summerlin Hosp early morning Saturday for food poisoning, as explained by the ER physician. Some of the sushi my son ordered did not look fresh and I told him that but he said its taste ok but I what does a 15yo know about what's fresh or not. I should have tasted it before allowing him to consume the sushi. I thought about what could have caused this incident w him and I can only put my finger on the sushi. nNot coming back here again.",1
"This restaurant is located in town square, upstairs across from the movie theaters and across from Ranch house restaurant. n nWent in for lunch. Not very busy with only 5 tables occupied. nThe hostess went to seat us at the lousiest spot in the room with most of the room empty as its a pretty big place. So we asked to be seated at a booth. Wow this seemed to really piss her off and she brought us to a booth pinned against the rail next to a pillar. So sitting down I see holes in the booth seats like cigarette burn holes. Really? You can't even smoke in there and the restaurant is like a month or 2 new. nThe decor is kinda like beach and swap meet furnishings coming together in a bad way. The booth table top was Way too high where your plate would be like chest high. Very awkward. I'll post a couple of pics that give the flava. nThe menu looked and sounded good but I couldn't smell anything and the vibe was bad, so we left before eating. n nNormally i give a second shot, but too many things wrong in a short time. Not worth my time nor do they deserve my money. I won't return",1
"This was our second time going for happy hour and I definitely liked it better the second time! The menu seemed to change a bit for happy hour and it was huge! Such great deals and menu options from appetizers to sushi. The food is really good, my boyfriend and his friend had the sushi and both seemed to like it. We sat on the patio right by the side walk and it was a nice day. I would recommend this place and I will definitely be taking my family to try it!",2
"I was lured into Frankie's by the promise of getting bombed on fruity drinks in tiki glasses and by the possibility of hooking up with hot rockabilly dudes. I also have a soft spot for Polynesian kitsch. This place made one of my dreams come true. n nI don't remember exactly what drink I ordered, but it was basically an oversized glass of rum mixed with the gentlest whisper of pineapple juice and it was only rated 3 skulls out of 5 in their booze potency rating system . This helped me achieve a comfortable state of inebriation quickly and for only 8. I didn't spring for the souvenir glass a fact that I now deeply regret . n nAs for the rest of my experience, allow me to break it down n n Decoration A n Music A n Customer Service C Bartenders have major 'tude, and that is if you are fortunate enough to have them condescend to acknowledge your presence. n Value B Drinks are 8 and up, but are 95 alcohol. Ah, Vegas. n Crowd C I brought the coolest people in there that night. I'm pretty sure everyone else was either a hooker or a john. n Vegas Experience B n Clearly marked bathroom facilities F Not only is it too dark inside the bar to see a foot in front of your face, but the men's and women's rooms are only loosely differentiated by ambiguous Polynesian figures on the doors. Needless to say, I chose the women's room completely by accident. n Drinks required to achieve requisite level of inebriation to facilitate mistake making 1 1 2. n Ratio of men to women 4 1 As I said, I suspect the only other women there that night were escorts. n Average age of patrons 40 n Number of people wearing Hawaiian shirts 3 apparently there is some sort of promotion if you wear a Hawaiian shirt. I was sad that I didn't get the memo. n Number of hot Rockabilly dudes at the bar 0 n n based on my visit in February, on a Friday night around 1am. n nIn conclusion, I would most definitely go there again to get thoroughly and efficiently shit hammered. Not bad at all.",2
"Avoid this place! Awful food quality and terrible delivery service are the twin motto's of Farley's Pizzeria. This is another bad strip mall pizza joint. n nTheir pizzas are gummy and flavorless. The chicken wings are rubbery and greezy. I have ordered for delivery a number of times and have had two complete no shows. The longest that I have waited for a Farley's delivery was one hour and 45 minutes. The food I ordered was stone cold. I live about 5 minutes away n nThis place is a little bit more expensive than others. Don't be a sucker, Avoid this place entirely!",1
"We frequent Genghis Grill quite a bit and I'm not sure what happened yesterday but our service was AWFUL! First, my bowl was cooked without the sauce I clearly placed next to my bowl. Then, my boyfriend's bowl came without the rice he ordered. Lastly, our waitress came to check on us once and that was to drop off the wrong drink. The place wasn't very busy so I was really surprised at the lousy service.",1
Absolutely the worst service. All chicken appetizers tastes identical. nThey tried to claim they no longer accept the Yelp 10 off.,1
"My new Husband and I went to Pub Grill because we LOVE Gordon Ramsay and watch hells kitchen master chef every season! The waiter, Taylor, was EXTREMLEY helpful to us in picking out the best entree's to have. I had the Grilled Lamb Burger YUMM! My husband had the Grilled NY Strip DELISH! Our server overheard that we had asked for Ranch dressing and instead of leaving me to use the blue cheese that was brought to me he brought me a number of options one of which included a cheese dip which anyone who knows me knows I cannot say no to cheese dip ! Everything was amazing I cant wait to go back one day!",2
"We could not of been luckier, walked up at 6pm Sunday night and the front table for three was wide open. Random water put on the table and an old, wore out menu. No bother. Not why we came here. Ordered up a lamb leak and beef coriander set of dumplings. The ladies hand made them in the back while we waited.wow. Next stop, juicy pillows of loveliness dipped into authentic vinegar soy sauce yes, the vinegar bite you get in China . Outstanding love of chewy, puffy, sour dumplings. n nOnly reason it is not 5stars is that i always hold that for the one in the million. n nDo it. Just eat it. Go ahead.eat it.no ones watching!",2
"Went there for lunch today for the first time and had the gumbo, while my colleague has the jambalaya. The food and service were both outstanding, and while we were never rushed, we were in and out in less than an hour. The atmosphere was comfortable and the prices quite reasonable very nice for a business lunch. I'm looking forward to going for dinner.",2
Really nice place. They are a Shell Vacation spot so someone will bug you to sit in on a time share presentation so beware. Booked through Expedia for one night for our anniversary. When we got there we were told all they had was a room with two doubles. Went outside to cancel with Expedia and they suddenly had the king room available that we had booked. Parking is terrible but free. Room was great! Everything was clean and comfortable. Had a nice stay.,2
"Compared to week nights vs weekends Paul's Club almost seems like two different bars. The week nights Paul's Club presents itself as a nice quieter bar for drinks and conversation. On the weekends, especially later in the evening i.e. after 10pm Paul's Club tends to be a nice bar but chances for a conversation are hit or miss, as it gets very crowded and very loud. Reasons to go anyways perhaps you'll get a seat and the beer selection is wonderful. Also they tend to mix some strong effing drinks, and obnoxious frat dudes are sparse. Paul's Club always has this unusual smell, it smells like a swimming pool. My vote is that it is some chemical to sanitize their carpets. Yes, a carpeted bar. eeh However if you find yourself bored at Paul's Club you and your drinking buddies can speculate what exactly that smell is. Also if you are a beer person, Paul's Club is one of the few bars in Madison that serves snake bites, which is a lovely pint glass with 1 2 Guinness and 1 2 Hard Cider. It's quite tasty",2
"Alright, I have dreaded writing this review ever since returning from our trip because i loved Pittsburgh and the amazing people who live there that we were able to make friends with. I don't want to show any disrespect, so lets get that out of the way. My buddies and I went into this experience blind. We were later told by locals that we needed to visit Primanti Bros. after several drinks and not sober, but unfortunately our experience was sober. With that said here we go. n nThe service was not that great. Folks seemed grumpy. I was shocked because the folks we met in Pittsburgh were some of the friendliest i have met in all my travels across the United States. n nCapicola and Cheese First off the coleslaw is more of a kraut then coleslaw. The capicola tasted like bologna and didn't resemble any capicola i've ever eaten. The french fries were soggy. n nRoast Beef and Cheese I didn't try it, but my buddy said it was the worst variation of a roast beef he's ever tried. n nPitts Burgher Cheese Steak This one is on us, but to put cheesesteak on anything for outsiders of Penn. people are thinking thinly sliced delicious rib eye. not ground beef. Nonetheless it was the worst of all of the sandwiches. n nLike i said we tried this place sober and everyone who we told our story to said that we should have drank first. I would like to give it a second chance, but my first impressions are sadly not very good.",1
Very disappointed with the open faced roast beef. No seasoning whatsoever! Service was good and the coleslaw was tasty but won't be returning.,1
"I have been to Arizona Mills countless times and each time I wonder why I bother coming here. I suppose it is to run quickly into my few stores.Ann Taylor Loft, Gymboree, Gap, Clarks. I plan my route, hit those stores, and leave as soon as I possibly can. n nNo matter what time I visit this shopping center, the bathrooms are always the worst! Smelly, dirty wet floor, unusable stalls. Even if I am here first thing in the morning. That tells me that they are not cleaned very often, if at all. If I can wait then I will not use the restrooms here. Beware! n nThere are ""security guards "" here. ha! They are young thugs walking around often with friends. I stay clear of these people. n nOh, and be careful of the kiosks in the middle of the mall walkway. I avoid those people as best I can. You will be accosted by calls of ""excuse me, can I ask you a question? "" to ""here try this lotion "" as it squirts towards you. I just ignore them but they persist so much that I would like to find out who to send a complaint to. It makes you feel like you can't even walk a few feet without those kiosk people yelling at you. ugh. n nThis is one junky ""mall "". I suggest going anywhere else other than here, if you possibly can!",1
"Great dinner and service.Chilean sea bass, chicken satay, lobster wontons, 5 spice ribs, and classic pad Thai. Ambiance is dark and sultry.",2
"Purchased few bags of potatoes but less than 2 weeks, started smelly and rejected when tried to returned 2 bags. Brought them back home, after tried to segregated to get the good part, at last nothing was left since all the potatoes were rotten and black spot inside even the outside skin looked good. What a rip off selling a very bad quality stuff to customer when all the purchased stuff end up in trash.",1
Service was slow waited for my smoothie for like 20 minutes. nMy wife liked her smoothie I didn't like mine at all,1
Great food and great atmosphere make for a great night. My wife and I were there this weekend and were more than pleaded. We each had the fish tacos and were both very pleased. Service was good and they had dos equis lager on tap.Will definitely be back.,2
"One of the worst movie theatres in the area. The sound kept going out, they stopped the movie, rewind, and start over. And again and again the sound goes out. Tried to talk to the manager and ask for a refund, was told since they rewind the movie and we didn't miss any parts they weren't going to refund the tickets. Tried to explain that it totally ruins the movie going experience, again nothing. Like the Tempe Marketplace Harkins much better.",1
Last two times we came here the food wasn't great and both times I had hair in my food. Don't get the deep dish pizza no sauce of cheese. The regular pizza us pretty good.,1
"Is there a Zero Star? n nAwesome a BEER garden in downtown Tempe. Sign me up. We get the menu and they have a decent selection of good craft beers. Awesome again. n nThere are 6 of us at the table this night Saturday prior to this review and out of the 6 beers we order, they are out of 4. Ummm THUD. Oh let me rephrase, they were out of 5, cause when they brought one of the beers they said they had they really didn't have it and changed his order to a Kiltlifter without asking. THUD again. n nHow does a beer garden on a Saturday night not have beer? n nOnto the food. I love sausages and they have 4 of them on the menu, I think two or three burgers and a few salads. Like 7 items total. So a brat and beer sounded good. Oh.were out of all sausage. THUD. n nEnough for me. n n7 menu items, out of 4, beer garden out of at least 5 beers on tap could have been more who knows tells me all I need to know. n nBuh bye.",1
"Definitely one of the worst restaurants i have been to. I thought it was going to a fast food type place like Nathan's but it was located in a bar. My wife and I ordered their chicago style hot dogs, That was a big disappointment. I think that Costco has a better hot dog then this place. we also ordered another sandwich and that was soaked with whatever meat juices it came out with. The bed was soggy and falling apart. They also didnt bring out our fries. They need to stick with bar food. I dont think this place is going to last as a restaurant.",1
"I'm not a big club guy, but I've been to a majority of those that Vegas has to offer and I have to say, I've probably been the least impressed with Jet. Getting in wasn't the problem as we were there for a bachelor party of 16 guys and fully intended on buying bottle service, which we did. n nThe first problem arose when we were told we would be buying 4 bottles and getting 1 free, because that would typically allow us to have 2 tables with that much alcohol and that many people. After all, the table areas are by no means large, especially at Jet. n nI'd say this club is by far one of the smallest I've been to and would be the normal size for an LA club.maybe. There's nothing unique to the club at all in regard to their atmosphere it's just a box of a room with flashing lights. I will say that the music was pretty solid though. n nOur hostess sat us down at a prime location, right near the dance floor directly beneath a go go dancer's stage area, where my friends were invited up to dance as they pleased, but unfortunately, and here's where the club loses a star, so were the table of 6 guys they squeezed in next to us. Did I mention that they ended up giving the 16 of us with 5 bottles only 1 table? Ya, no bueno. My friend was talking to one girl who tried to grab our bottle and start pouring herself drinks. n nI'm a nice guy, but when I'm paying way more than I should for drinks and you start trying to take what I've paid hard earned money for, I'm not gonna be a happy camper. I politely told her that she didn't pay for those drinks and only to take what was offered to her by my friend at the table. n nThe crowd was pretty ghetto, as my friends had told me was the case when they've been to Jet as well. We had a good time regardless as it's always fun catching up with friends, especially when you have people waiting on you to refill your ice and drinks. n nThe reason I'm only giving them two stars isn't necessarily for their service because it was great, but rather, for the money you spend to get a table, you could easily get two tables at a much better club with a much nicer atmosphere. Tryst, Pure on the rooftop.the list goes on. n nI think the highlight of the night was when my buddy got kicked out for trying to get a little too fresh with the hostess. The result overall? I won't be going back unless it's mandated by another bachelor party.",1
"It's Friday afternoon 2 45 pm you'd think the drive thru would be quicker than the last time I was in it on a Sat 22min , nope 10 minutes. 2cars ahead of me. I'm not ever coming back to this one. What a joke.",1
"I guess my experience was completely different than most as I rented a Cabana. I do have to say the pool closes at 7pm, which seems very early, but I cannot remember how the time compares to the other pools I have been to on the strip. n nWe rented a Cabana on a Saturday for 200 18 gratuity added after check out . Prices vary depending on day and time of the year You get the Cabana from 10am to close at 7pm . The Cabana came with water, coke, fruits, snacks, misters, tv, media hub, pool floats and a safe. All included in the price. Our server was PHENOMENAL. When he first showed us around our cabana, he said, ""I will check on you every 15 minutes "" and he was NOT lying. Always there, taking our drink orders, which they had plenty to choose from. The food came in a good amount of time, with plenty of food options to choose from for a range of appetites and budgets. Note our friends went to the pool the day before, without a Cabana and mentioned the food took WAY longer for them and it was chips and salsa . My favorite part about the Cabana is that 2 out of the 3 Cabana sections have private pools in which a row of Cabanas shares. n nIf you're plan is to relax by the pool all day, you might as well fork over the money, especially since the Cabana has a max of 8 people, so potential to pay 25pp. again prices vary . Although, I would say to heed caution in ordering, it's VERY easy to spend a LOT of money. n nQUICK TIP the Cabana's are first come, first serve and the Vdara gives you a window to check in from 10am 12pm. I highly advise getting there early to pick your spot!",2

"Wow, the staff here is incredibly rude, we arrived and the receptionist was very unfriendly, then the girl that took us back started asking my daughter questions without introducing herself, I had to ask her if she was the doctor. My daugter was then seen and her father was meeting us there he was at work, but coming late , but they would not allow him in the room ""because the Dr. was uncomfortable "" having more than one person back there.REALLY? Then they changed their story saying that we were almost done and so they would not let him come back to the room. He should have been allowed back so that he could hear the doctor's final commments. AVOID THIS PLACE at all costs. I would have rather sat in an ER for 2 hours. At least they are nice and allow fathers to hear their children's diagnosis.",1
Great food! They make it very fast aslo.,2
"My boyfriend and I came here for date night while we were in Vegas. We really enjoyed our experience. We got a table that overlooked the fountain at Bellagio, which was beautiful. Our waiter was the nicest gentleman. We had a great time chatting up with him. We had heard wonderful things about the spaghetti so we both got that and devoured it. Their drinks were delicious and so was the complimentary bread. They catered to us very well and we were delighted. We were so stuffed so we didn't have room for dessert but I'm sure they were just as good. Highly recommend this place!",2
"Tao Restaurant is a pretty nice place. Really cool environment, good vibe, beautiful layout, etc, etc. It's also not a bad thing that they don't seat you right away even if you have reservations .they have a nice lounge area. n nIf restaurants were all about the environment, then Tao would get 5 stars. But alas, this is a review of a restaurant, so the actual food is important too. Typical asian fusion stuff.a mix of a wide variety of asian dishes. If you don't know what asian fusion is, think about it this way.you can order sashimi Japanese , pad thai thai , satay chicken for appetizers thai , and then throw down some shrimp, sea bass, spicey tuna rolls, kung pao, etc. Oh yeah, avoid the sashimi.we're talking 4 small leaflets worth for 60. The food is decent, but nothing special. The environment goes along way great place to take your special someone or a bunch of friends .but the food is nothing to rave about. Remember, it's definitely on the pricey end. If you're considering a few appetizers, some drinks, maybe a bottle of sake, an entree for you and your sweatie, and then some dessert to close the deal, we're talking 100 each, easily. n nAnd please, please don't go here just to get a free line pass for Tao, the club. It's not worth it. Why pay 100 per person for a mediocre dinner just to get into the club? And besides, if you're part of a sausage fest, you'll still have to pay cover and still wait a bit in line. And if you cheap out on the dinner where your main motivation was to get into the club and it's obvious , the server doesn't have to hook you up. n nAnd once you're in, you're screwed because Tao is geared towards table service.unless you enjoy being packed like sardines well I suppose if there were two girls and you. . Anyways, think about it. 100 for dinner, for cover, and then a whole bunch of for drinks. .and standing the whole time and being very uncomfortable. Or spending 200 250 each person for bottle table service, depending on how many are in your group. It's a no brainer. n nSo back to the Tao restaurant.great environment good vibe, cool place to eat.average food.",1
"This Restoration Hardware is a cool retro furniture home decor with the poor luck of being in the wrong location. The Phillips Place shops never appear busy, as Phillips Place is more of an eating and movie going area than anything else. But don't let that stop you from visiting Restoration Hardware! n nBesides old fashioned looking but now back in style furniture, bedding, and bath items, Restoration Hardware offers cool retro items like games, telescopes, record album yes, record ALBUM, as in LP frames, and other gadgets. Everything in the store is brand new but has a retro feel to it. It's much more fun to browse through than Pottery Barn! Right on, man!",2
"Very disappointing. Originally came to restaurant on a recommendation and was impressed, but after 5 years away i did not like the changes. The place has turned into a dive bar, and the servers are truly crabby. It is impossible to tell who is a guest and who is a server. The food is mediocre, service and atmosphere terrible. I will stay away from this restaurant and would advise others to do the same.",1
"We had issues from the start at the Omni Hotel. Because we book through Orbitz, not the hotel website, we were not guaranteed 2 beds like we had wanted. We had kill 3 hours while they got a room together. No big deal, I understand now that is the risk you take by booking through a 3rd party. n nWhen we got to the room couple more issues nThe toilet ran for 15 minutes after you flush it. nThe mini fridge was broken. We found this out after we had placed all of our stuff in it and unpacked. nThe AC was very slow to kick it. It was in the high 80's that weekend. It took about 6 hours to get the room to cool down to a decent level. nThe ice machine on our floor was broken level 21 . Sucks when the fridge is broken. n nGood things about the hotel nParking, easy in, easy out at 15 day right at the hotel. nLocation, location, location. Easy, safe walking distance to all Montreal has to offer. nVery large bathrooms and closets. n nBad things about the hotel nNo free breakfast nNo couch in the room. nNo vending machines I didn't see any at least nVery dated furniture and carpets. nSmall TV. nwifi was 15 day I was unable to pick up any local networks either n nI never tried the hotel restaurant. The menu looked over priced compared to the local restaurants. Breakfast started at 15. Dinners looked around 35 . nI probably won't stay here again unless I get a really good price. The Marriott next door has more to offer free wifi, breakfast, kitchenette, couch at only a slightly higher price.",1
"I agree with the other reviewers, this place is pretty darn cute. But the food is hit or miss. Neither my husband or I liked the chilli. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious. I got onion rings instead of the coleslaw and they were tasty but a couple of pieces were a bit soggy. The root beer on draft was cool. I also liked the detailed descriptions and drawings of the local cattle brands on the place mats. n nThe best part of the cafe was the attached shop. Many unusual items and lots of cool stuff to look at. The bakery items all looked delicious. We got a piece of the Tennessee Lemon pie which was very unusual. We also got some scones to go and those were a big hit at breakfast the next morning. n nSo, why four stars if the food was just A OK? Well, like I said, its just so darn cute. There's not much else around there so everyone in the cafe is either a small town local or en route to somewhere else. There was lots of activity but it still somehow felt like they were running at a slower pace than the rest of the world. Its just such a unique spot, you really have to see it for yourself.",2
"I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. My friend told me about it. I got there and this guy who seemed like he did not what he was doing helped Me told him it was my first time . He was so busy and did not explain anything. I was so hungry so i. Proceeded to get Food. There was a fridge with all this shabu ingredients , it was ok. The bad part was it was supposed to be all you eat but then they gave me a menu that said you could only order 4 items ,i was surprised but i looked at the pictures and saw cute little appetizer things i ordered 4 items. When it came i was really shocked the things that came did not resemble the pictures and instead of three pieces i got two pieces . Please if you are providing visual references please make it similar to what you are going to give me. So I could at least identify what i ordered. i was so frustrated now because I waited for a long time for my orders. It was hailing a taxi cab in New York you have to chase the servers so i never got to see my waiters it was always someone new ,people were waiting to pay and it was taking a long time. Well I said i am just going to have dessert i heard of the mango and sticky rice in a lot of the reviews and i was excited because it was the only thing i could look forward for at this point. Guess what when i asked about it the waitress told me my only choices were green tea ice cream and another thing that i didn't even understand.Im sorry but that was it. I paid and let and went to another place to get my dessert . i am not coming back!",1
"As you can imagine, Rhumbar has pretty good rum based cocktails. We sat on the lounges inside to order our drinks as the patio area was almost full and VERY smoky. The lady bartender was actually quite nice somewhat of a rarity for Vegas! and even allowed my friend and I to split a Zombie! She ended up serving us each 3 4 of a cocktail it was watery but that was great customer service! My rum obsessed husband thought his Mai Tai was good not quite as good as a real non touristy Hawaiian Mai Tai, but good for Vegas. It is nicer outside on the patio, especially at dusk when it's not so crowded they have great music out there!",2
" ink refill fast and cheap, but only one thing it was a little messy getting the refill cartridge out of the plastic bag and into my printer, fyi use disposable gloves so you don't get ink all over your hands.the staff is helpful and would go back, but will let them know,they need to clean up cartridge better before i leave the store.",2
"Sloppy, slow, waiter wiping his nose as he brings my sandwich. Ask for a substitution to fries and for got a quick no. Bathroom outside the restaurant?",1
"Went to this place with my best friend sometime last week. We were starving so anything good would have tasted great. Instead, the chicken teriyaki we had was simply the worst I've had in my life. Rubbery chicken, and the teriyaki sauce was just disgusting. I didn't try the sushi but I saw plenty of people eating it and not looking as disappointed as we were. I will like to say I will try this place again but it was not cheap and so so bad that no,I can't give it a second chance.",1
"After hearing so much about Bianco I was excited to finally give it a try for a friend's birthday. We arrive to an hour and a half wait which we expected with 5 people and enjoyed some drinks in the bar next door as we waited. The bartender was excellent and the atmosphere was great which was really the highlight of the visit. n nWhen we sat down I was surprised at how small the dining room is, but I guess it explains the continual waiting list. A small room isn't a problem unless you pack too many table in so that there is no room for your server to do his job without continually bumping your chair elbow table head, which is exactly the case here. Our server was very attentive and nice but he just didn't have enough space to properly serve the table. n nWe ordered salads and some pizzas to share and the salads were very salty. Quite strange to have a salad with that much salt, and I've never experienced it at another restaurant. The pizzas were all very underwhelming too. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad, just average. I had much better pizza a few blocks to the west although I don't remember the name of the place. All in all the experience was a disappointment and I don't see myself returning any time soon.",1
"I really REALLY wanted to like this place. There's 3 4 of us that go out every Friday afternoon for some drinks and apps. With more and more places closing or getting worse this place was close, looks nice and in general is not a totally bad place. n nWe went a couple times and things were pretty good. Nice patio and good happy hour. We went a week ago and my friend and i had our normal Long Island Ice Teas. Now, I've had them from Hawaii to NYC and when they're made right, they're refreshing and nice., When they're made bad.the WORST drink on Earth. n nOne sip and we both gagged, looked at each other and did the Ug dance. I took them back to the guy and my friend played it safe with some scotch and I thought I'd try a margarita. DUMB MOVE Ron. The bartender kid said they didn't do a lot of cocktail biz so they had no Grande Marnier and he said they squeezed their own limes. n nNow, the margarita is the most popular drink in America so you'd think people could make it right especially in Arizona. Not so. I knew the taste I was tasting but put my thoughts on hold. This time the food scored a 6 with the chips limp and greasy actually dripping and needed a replacement. n nWe decided to give this one more try this last week. I made the same mistake of ordering a Rita. When i asked the waitress bartender after another bad drink it turns out the kid last week wasn't even a bartender. AND YET HE'S MAKING A COMPLICATED LONG ISLAND? And. turns out my taste buds were correct. they use Pope's lime Not fresh. Pope's is the worst with that weird heavy aftertaste that is as fake a the lemon and lime juice you buy in the store in the plastic fruits. n nIf you're going to run a place and invest the money and time, USE FRESH QUALITY INGREDIENTS. I don't think i'm asking too much. n nSo many places are cutting corners, lacking service, poor food.they must think the public will put up with anything to drink and eat out. NOT SO. Fill up your bar with some good stock, Make your own sour mix, teach your waiters NOT to be a bartender and get some consistent food coming out from the back. There's too many options when eating out to go to places that don't care enough. n nAgain. just keeping it real.",1
"I love the Chinos for lunch. n I Love it even more for dinner you see the distinction? I used a capitol ""L "" . There are always wonderful Mexican Chinese fusion plates, but there are actually available tables to sit at for dinner. To some, this combination may sounds like heaven and to others, a gut bomb, but no matter.You must go and try it. It is impossible not to fall in love! I am not sure where ""jerk "" spices originated, but the food is infused with those tasty flavors as well. n nIf you have never been to the Chinos before, don't fret. There are samples available of just about everything on the menu. Also, you may want to have the staff walk you through how to order on your first visit, as the process can be a bit confusing. Each meal is topped off with a cookie, usually snicker doodle, but if you are really lucky, you may be blessed with a chocolate lava. Best wishes and go hungry!",2
"Revisited a few times now since my initial review and I am really not impressed. My previous list of cons still stand. n n there is no atmosphere, even when its really busy n the music was strange n nThe reason for dropping a star is due to the service. We have been in when the place is quiet and a busy both times yielded a similiar experience where you cannot get served. n nFirst time we were the only people at the bar we had to interupt a couple deeply engaged in discussion to order a drink, which were promptly shoved towards us with disdain and a roll of her eyes. Great, waited for 10 minutes while you chatted each other up and generally ignored us. The other times we have popped in for a quick pint have resulted in similar waits at the bar normally due to 50 60 of the staff actually doing nothing. The bar had people around all talking about what are these other guys were up to and why it takes so long to get served. They were pretty much walking up and down and talking to each other. n nPreviously the staff seemed quite used to the bar and its stock, in recent visits this hasnt been the case. There was issue with knowing that Aspall was Cider recently. Erm. n nAlso this really put me off. They had ran out of pint glasses for some reason, so new boxes of fresh glasses were brought in. These were straight out of the cardboard boxes they are delivered in. The glasses werent washed and were immediately filled and handed to customers. It has been a while since I worked in the bar trade but I was under the impression these need cleaned before being use. n nThe place has so much promise but it reallty doesnt work for me. n nPlus side pints are kept well, selection of booze is good, decor is still cool and has been reworked to make the seating more effective. Food wise still not eaten here, but I keep hearing good things. n nI dont dislike the pub, but I find it a hard place to like.",1

"Four of us dined here for the second time on Sunday. The food was excellent.however, this was our second time experiencing poor service, which we thought was an aberration on our first visit! All wait staff are exceedingly rude to the point of exasperation! They are not attentive and act as though they are enduring you! We had to ask for hot tea repeatedly after entrees arrived with a time gap nbetween each we had to ask repeatedly for the accompanying rice. Insult ended our experience.when presented with the bill we were asked by two wait staffers to vacate our table.even though no one was waiting for a table and several tables were vacant. We will definitely NEVER return to this venue!",1
"Velocity is transitioning to fill the giant shoes of the now defunct Cellblock Padlock. As they say out here in the west, ""them's some mighty big shoes yer fillin' boy. "" I wish them all the luck. This is a dark bar, with two pool tables and no attitude. The staff are friendly and attentive, and that matters a lot to me. They apparently have male strippers on some nights. Some of them need to be tied up more often, methinks. Anyway, this is a good bar, but it will take time to fill the hole in our hearts that was Cellblock.",2
"Apartment management changes every year the two women that are there now are not kind at all. They smile in your face as they refuse to help you. They are not courteous, and have no customer service skills. If your rent is 1 day late they involve the attorney and make you pay an attorney fee, instead of knocking on your door, they mail you a letter. inconsiderate, lazy. I have lived here for over four years, and can't wait till my lease is up. Generally they fix small issues with the apartment quickly, but for the first 2 years that I lived here, my dryer didnt work, and everytime I complained, someone would come check it, and not fix it. The first 2 months I lived here there were roaches. It is quiet at night, but the people that live downstairs can hear everything that goes on upstairs. Yes, I mean EVERYTHING, from toilets being used not just flushed , to moaning and groaning. There was a major accident in the pool, but they did not drain it. They just re opened it the next day. That's unsanitary.",1

The bars are in the back and VIP at the front with the DJ so you would be dancing toward the VIP. Jagged Edge was performing infront of me at an armslength. That's Cray cray!

"First of all, I'd like to point out that I am somewhat of a fro yo afficionado. I have tried just about every self serve yogurt shop you can think of. I have been known to drive 20 miles away from my home just to try a new yogurt shop. And this, my friends, is among the best. It has themed nights, including wearing your PJ's to the shop and getting half off the price. And dude, get this.they cater! They will bring several flavors and toppings into your home, business, whatever. Now I need an excuse to order them for something.",2
"I was a loyal customer of Jade Mountain beads for years, until they moved down the street from their original location. After that, the employees seemed to think that their shit didn't stink, because they looked at every customer as a potential shoplifter. If they weren't basically accusing you of stealing by demanding to hold your purse while you shopped although you were purchasing 100 worth of merchandise, I'm not even exaggerating , they were making snide remarks about customers when they thought people couldn't hear them. I seriously heard them talking about how fat a woman was who was shopping in the store. This was not a one time thing either. I had also heard them making plans about going out to ""get wasted "" after work, and talking about their sexual exploits. Then apparently, the owners couldn't make the rent anymore and had to close. They had a liquidation sale, and all of their good merchandise was sold. Good riddance. n nNow fast forward to 2008, I had no idea that one of the former offenders at Jade Mountain had relaunched as ""Indus Beads "" and actually went in the store. I was horrified when I first walked in and saw that face behind the counter. I was kind of waiting for her to ask me for my purse. Thankfully, she did not. I still felt that my prescence in the store was a nuisance to the shopkeeper, as usual. At least some things never change. n nANYWAY, as for the store itself, all I saw was the old remaining stock from Jade Mountain that they couldn't give away at the end including the awkward fixtures and some crappy belts and shirts laying around at extremely inflated prices. n nI think I will just keep going to Burnie's, which always seemed a lot more friendly to their patrons.",1
"Great place and hardly ever crowded. Service is a little bit slow, but the atmosphere is really good and so it makes up for it. Protip, great place for a coffee first date, if it goes well walk to Phipp's. Also, subsidized by the city, check it out or you're wasting your taxes",2
"Terrible service experience. After waiting 20 minutes with no wait staff acknowledging our presence, we began to wonder if this was a self service restaurant. The place was less than half full and still not one person stopped by our table to help us. Pizza is ok but is absolutely not worth the hassle.",1
"came into town for one day after a week long cruise from boston. stayed at the embassy suites would definitely give it a thumbs up . There are a lot of expensive restaurants in the area. I was traveling with a family of 10 grandparents and grandkids . Needed a restaurant with a nice atmosphere, reasonable prices and good selection on the menu. This restaurant fit the bill. Ask to sit in the garden area, not street side.",2
"The Food Selection was amazing fresh veges, shrimp, quality beef. select your own and then they prepare. I had the steak and shrimp combo. unfortunately flavorless and ill prepared. I expressed my dissatisfaction with having spent 52.75 for two meals, and asked about how they prepare the meat. I was told that they wok the meat first, add the veges and then the shrimp. Seriously? The meat was like rubber and lacked any seared flavor at all. It was like they steamed everything together. Panda Express tastes better for one fifth the price. Come on guys, you can do BETTER!",1
"Stood and waited for 30 mins for a table. What was really disheartening was the amount of empty tables we could see through the the pointless but clearly expensive glass sign. n nWhile Gordon may be a renowned chef world wide, it's doesn't excuse the ridiculous get up that is presented here. Empty tables no one paying why the hel make people queue needlessly when there are perfectly good tables available. n nSadly we didn't wait to sample the food but there is no excuse for this crap! Can I say btw we counted 32 empty seats alone. This was in the back as we walked by!",1

"Friends have raved about Bountiful Baskets, and I was excited to try it out. I just did the conventional basket and I was underwhelmed. I didn't do a full price analysis, but I would guess that I could have gotten about the same amount of fruits and veggies of the same quality shopping at Fry's or Sprouts. The green bell peppers were some of the best I have had usually a red bell pepper fan, but these were quite good . Cucumbers, onions, broccoli, and blackberries were all good. The apples, pears and tomatoes were mediocre. The pineapple was completely flavorless. And I got a whole bunch of kiwis, which I am mildly allergic to but that's not their fault . n nTo sum it up, I think I'll do much better just picking out my own produce in the future.",1
"Second time here, ordered a Greek Salad with Chicken Kabob. the plate was so small i couldn't cut my chicken or even fork out the cheap iceberg lettuce without some falling on the table, chicken was way too saucy as well.

"Stopped in here today and figured I would give it a try as I pass it all the time. First thing is the smoking section is right in front of the place so you have to walk through it to get inside. I get splitting migraines from cigarette smoke so I had to hold my breath. once in side there was a sign saying please seat your self. so we did and figured they did not see us come in because it took for ever to get service. the booth was dirty, and the window sill had a inch layer of dust, with some old fries and about five dead flies on it. it took forever for the food to come, which is odd because there was only five people in the place and three outside smoking. the food was nothing to brag about just plain bleh. Not sure how they stay in business must have cheap drink on the lounge side and if you are wasted you don't care about the rest. place should shut down.",1

"Awesome awesome show! n nI had a BLAST watching the MJ One show! To be honest, I really didn't know what I was expecting when I got tickets to this show. The BF was super apprehensive thinking it was like a fake MJ performing a show or something. n nIf you're expecting a full on Cirque du Soleil show with tricks and flips and what not, don't expect it from this show. I suggest going to another show like Le Reve or Mystere. The MJ One show is more like a tribute show featuring all of Michael Jackson's top hits with great choreography and a little bit of Cirque performing acts. n nEverything was spectacular. The music, the performance, the tricks, I enjoyed it so much that I was on my feet by the end of the show. I don't want too spoil it too much but the lights on this show are AMAZZZING! Even the jaded BF loved it! n nI really liked how they really kept true to MJs choreography, music, and his videos. The show did such a great job of integrating his famous moves and songs into the show that it didn't seem overplayed out. Expect a high energy and really LOUD show! n nIf you're a big MJ fan like me, trust me and go watch this show. You'll be moving in your seat while singing along to the songs the entire time! One of the coolest shows I've seen in Vegas so far!",2
"Two weeks ago I noticed via Martin Lewis's MSE website that anyone can trial a fitness centre near to them. So set about trying to locate one within the city that would suit. n nFinally landing on one that looked like it might do what it says on the tin I opted for Nuffield Health. As I never knew there was a sports centre this far west in town and it was in my bus route, naturally it was the best choice. n nI hadn't officially started working out this year, as running up and down stairs at work doesn't really count, I jumped at the chance not only get back to the gym, but also to review what a session at Nuffield Health is like? n nTime spent in reception upon arrival was definitely shorter than at my last keep fit place a few years ago at Virgin. So in one way this gives you less time sitting about discussing the unique selling points of the centre, filling out paperwork and getting to know them, when sometimes all you want is to feel the burn. n nIt has a 12 point MOT that recommends you don't proceed with if you have eaten before or done any form of exercise, so I'll have to book that for another week and it all sounds quite rigorous? n nThe facilities and layout are great not to squished like my local gym in Tranent, but good enough for constant turnover in the two hours I was there. All the equipment worked, also there just the right amount of people in each of the two large workout rooms located at the top of the stairs to not make me wait at all, and keep the sweat on so's not cool down much. n n1 2 day for some of the classes at weekends so didn't see what they were like. The quiet pool on arrival was fully stocked when the now burnt out shell of mine was in need if some h2O relief, so opted out of this deciding instead to try out the food facilities. n nWithin 5 minutes I was enjoying a Berry Smoothy, Cajan Chicken Wrap and Coffee approx. u00a310 . The Smoothy was icy cool and slightly tart, coffee was Costa type, watery and warm. The chicken wrap was my second choice as they did not make any pasta chicken, which I prefer after a workout but mild spicy it came with a green and mixed pepper salad, complimented with a nicely balanced vinegar type dressing so many places miss this when leaves are shouting out for it ! n nMy only gripe is with the amount of grease that emerged from the wrap on trying to pick it up, so had to use the cutlery. Now it was not that significant greasy disaster as to merit leaving some evidence for Mulder and Scully, but less is surely better, especially due to location. n nThe u00a350 m may put some off especially since central gyms charge less than half of this, but I did see some signage within that did prompt at u00a325 m which for me would be better for my wallet. n nUpper body workout tick , 2k run tick , 12 point MOT to be booked , will ""I be back "".Taking just over an hour from East Lothian in the direction of the Corn Exchange, wasn't too far out of the way, and only requires one mode of transport to get here? Also it has parking, gel in the showers incase you forgot to pack some and free wifi, just ask for the password at reception. I give it 4 5 stars for all mentioned above possibly 5 when they add the revamped Sauna, coming soon.",2
"Live close by in the area and have been coming here since it opened. This place is amazing. Outstanding and friendly family owned and operated. Fresh cut meat, great bread, clean, what more can you ask for. Maybe 50 cents more than a Subway or Blimpies but you can't even put the quality anywhere near the same ball park as this place. Visit minimum once a week. Owners clearly have a passion for their business which is refreshing. You will never go to another sub place after coming here. n nRecommendation Gatti signature sub.

"I first came to this convention center when there was an event there for the Las Vegas Bowl when my team, Cal, was playing in the Las Vegas Bowl.

Parking was easy and the convention center employees were nice enough.",1
"Stopped in for Happy Hour and either they have some really potent beer or man does their Lobster Shrimp Mac 'N Cheese just blow my palate away. Absolutely the creamiest, richest and heavenly tasting thing I have had that isn't some form of steak. I wish you could have seen the expression on my face as the bartender asked how I liked it. For a minute he was worried I was having some kind of medical issue as I slowly regained consciousness from the coma of deliciousness. The cheese bread they served with it was toasted to absolute perfection with a harder cheese encrusting a soft creamy cheese that completely melted in my mouth. For twenty dollars I am hard pressed to think of a meal I would rather have. The bartenders were friendly. The drinks were decent. I would honestly keep coming back and ordering the Mac 'N Cheese to go and eating it in my car just to have some alone time. Perhaps I am still under the influence of that intoxicating dish. Go see for yourself and I promise you wont regret it. Unless you are counting calories. In that case run for the hills. ",2
"Second time there and again we were impressed. Our friends and us wanted to get away from the crazy crowds on the strip so we took a short drive to Ventano in Henderson. Glad we did. Great food, great view, and great service. My wife had the oysters to start which were delish. Eggplant dishes are good. The side of meatballs was very good too. I'll definitely go back for Italian food again.",2

"This small, informal restaurant serves Peruvian fare duh. We started off with a complimentary salad of jicama, carrots, cucumber and onion in lime juice and a cup of aji dipping sauce. This salad proved to be both spicy, refreshing and the best dish we consumed this evening. Our shared appetizer was papa a la huancaina boiled potatoes covered with a mild aji sauce and cream. I could not taste the aji sauce and the overall flavor was muted. I also tried a glass of chica morado a purple corn drink which was pretty good though it won't be replacing diet Pepsi at Hacienda de Westie. Ann ordered arroz con Mariscos a mixed seafood dish with rice billed as being Peru's take on paella. I settled on a mixed seafood soup called parihucla that the menu described as Peru's take on bouillabaisse. Both entrees were bland and compared unfavorably to their better known counterparts.",1
"I am torn with this review. I wish we could review the doctors and office staff separately. I would give the front office staff the lowest score possible. They are the worst people to deal with hands down. Before even leaving the hospital from my c section, the front office staff was calling to harass me because my son ""was not covered "" on either of my two insurances. From my experience, insurances do not add people on the minute the are born or eligible. They called me again TWICE before his first appointment at four days old. Then, when I came in for his appointment, they told us he was not covered. I again explained that he had probably not been added. I explained that we had ALWAYS carried insurance, that my son was covered through both insurances and that it would be fine. They said they would call the insurance again. Then they asked me if my two year old had gone back to the newborn waiting room with my husband. He had. So they made me walk to the newborn area to tell my two year old he could not sit back there. I could not walk well at all yet, but they did not seem to mind. I walked back to tell my husband to bring the newborn and my son out to the other waiting area where we had to walk back to again. Lots of fun walking through the burning sensation from my incision. Once we all sat down, they came out into the waiting room and told us loudly and in front of the other patients that he had not been added yet shocker! and that we would have to pay the full fee if we wanted to keep the appointment. We agreed to pay. They made sure to tell us several times that we were being considered self pay patients. I was humiliated. I called one of the insurance companies and ended up missing most of my son's appointment because I was explaining the situation to the agent. She said she had never heard of such a thing and that I typically took about three weeks to add a new person to a policy. She told the woman behind the desk that newborns were automatically covered from day one. Based on hearing that information, the ladies behind the desk finally quit harassing me and I got to see the last few minutes of the doctor's visit. When I complained to the office manager, she said ""the staff were following the training instructions they had been given. "" No apology. I would leave in a second if it were not for the amazing doctors. Dr. Apley and Dr. Alexander are incredible. It is too bad they have such horrid office staff. Here's hoping the front office staff has high turnover and they all end up leaving so that the doctors have employees who do not treat normal people like homeless people. Horrible.",1

"I used to like Filmbar. It had a good atmosphere and a great DJ on Saturday nights. They recently removed their comfortable seating and replaced it with high tables and hard chairs. I've had several bad experiences with the staff at Filmbar. The first time was when I wanted to see a movie that was sold out. I was unaware it was sold out, but the girl at the counter was very rude to me and told me I should have known it was going to sell out and it wasn't her fault I didn't plan ahead yet their website said nothing about it being sold out, and that's something I did check before driving down there. But since there was no parking, and I had to park far away and walk a long distance, I guess that should have been a clue. But aside from that, 2 other times I have gone there to see a movie and waiting for service at the counter to buy a drink and was ignored. One of those times, it seemed as if patrons line up to be served. So I stood in line and waited, and when it got to be my turn, the bartender went over and talked to his friends and basically ignored me. This place has terrible service. And regarding the person who posted that they were kicked out of the bar for not having a current AZ ID, I have seen children at this bar. I am assuming the children were there with their parents But my point is, if children are allowed to be at this bar, I don't see why someone who is over 21 with an old style AZ license should be turned away.",1

"To add to what many other Yelpers said you really can't tell what is Richardson's and what is Rokerij the free valet is very convenient, especially considering there is basically no lot it is extremely dark inside, so don't plan on enjoying the appearance of your food and MAKE A RESERVATION if you want to eat in Richardson's. n nThat being said, we had very good service not super attentive, but I much prefer when servers don't spend a lot of time hovering. All our meals were correct and everything was prompt but not rushed. We went on a Tuesday, which happens to be half price bottles of wine night, so that was a great surprise. n nI ordered the Posole to start. It was VERY spicy but delicious. We also had the chips and guacomole, with the 3 different salsas, and that was wonderful to start. n nMy husband ordered the enchilada platter and his father ordered the New Mexico platter. They both loved their food, although it was alsy very spicy the particular green chiles in their sauce were very spicy at least . n nMy mother in law had the skewers and it was fine. n nI had the Pasta Heidi green chili pasta with chicken and a chipotle cream sauce. I literally could have died right then and been satisfied. It was SO. GOOD. We literally can't wait to go back just so we can have the Pasta Heidi again. My mouth is watering. YUM. n nI would also recommend checking out the basement bar, just to have a drink. Have your server or a hostess show you how to get down there. It's pretty cool, and a nice place to spend some time while you wait for your table.",2

"I used to absolutely love going to this Last Chance, oh say about 6 7 years ago when I was in high school. It had great quality stuff, was reasonably stocked, and, while ALWAYS crowded, the people shopping and working were pleasant and helpful. No pushing, no rude behavior, none of that. I used to get great dresses and shoes from here. n nNo more. I went to this Last Chance about a month ago to go shopping with my boyfriend, who needed nice dress shirts for work. I walked out with a lost faith in humanity, and a strong desire to gouge my eyes out. I'm not kidding. I will NOT shop here again unless bribed with a considerable amount of Yogurtology across the street! n nOkay so my problem with LS now is. well, everything. We went around 11 AM on a Thursday, which is a reasonable time, I would think. no. It is incredibly crowded, stuffed full of rude customers. n nSeveral times, while I was physically looking through a rack of shirts, women would push INTO me to push me out of the way and grab something they saw. This happened so many times, I gave up on looking probably their goal. n nNo one was there to help us in the dressing rooms, so the BF just walked in. don't know if this is policy? n nMost sizes were way too big he's an average popular size , so we left with exactly two dress shirts. n nSeven years ago, it was fun to go shopping at LS and you walked out with some incredible finds. I don't think you can find anything like that nowadays it's been overrun with people probably trying to re sell online I mean seriously this one older woman had SEVEN pairs of the same color size style jeans?

"My husband and I snagged a travelzoo voucher and decided to stay here for a night. The resort is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly.

The pool was smaller than expected but we were there in July so it wasn't crowded and the cabana staff was very accommodating. My two issues were the food menu was quite limited although they do offer a happy hour which is nice, but only offer certain foods at certain times, which is frustrating , and my pedicure at the spa was below average.",2
"My wife and my best friend were both visiting me in Montreal at the same time and this was the place I knew we had to go. We'd all heard about it and it was going to be our 'special meal.' Unfortunately, Au Pied de Cochon was just blah. n nWe started with cocktails. A Manhattan, Lemon Slush, and a Raspberry Mojito were ordered and tasted. The service was cool for the slush because they bring you the vodka in a little tea pot to add as you want. The Raspberry Mojito was refreshing and definitely the most attractive drink on the table. Cocktails 4.5 5 n nOur appetizer was the ""Salade de Croustillant de PDC "" which we were sold on because of the 'crispy pork belly.' Unfortunately, it was pork belly in some sort of breading, which didn't have much taste to it. The salad itself was 'meh.' 2 5 n nWe shared Duck in a Can 1 5 and Foie Gras Poutine 4 5 as the main courses for between the three of us. The presentation of the Duck in a Can was really cool, I like the art on the can and I like that they open it up in front of you. Unfortunately, the contents of the can didn't taste as good as the can looked. This was the worst dish of the night. The duck breast was just ok, the skin was chewy and not at all appetizing and I love me some duck skin , the rest of the dish was extremely salty. If it had one more grain of salt on it, it would have clearly been too much and I'd have sent it back. Foie Gras Poutine somewhat lived up to its reputation and I would maybe recommend just grabbing a couple 5 beers and sharing a Poutine for those dead set on hitting this place up. The foie gras really tasted good on and the gravy had good flavor. n nWe decided against dessert, not because we were full, but because the meal just wasn't that good and the dessert menu was full of boring stuff. n nI'm ready to pay for a good meal, but this wasn't even a mediocre meal. Au Pied didn't live up to its reputation at all and I wouldn't recommend that anyone go. n nThe next night, we tried for round 2 on the nice meal and had much success at O'Thym which is also Apportez Votre Vin . Take your APC dollars there.",1
"Had carry out once from Swagat. I may not be an expert on Indian curries, and I'm not usually one to criticize strongly, but I have ordered my fair share of saag paneer favorite dish . In a word, bland.not that it wasn't spicy, but simply that it had basically no flavor. Bland enough that although Swagat is just down the road I have yet to be tempted to order a second dish. May try their lunch buffet someday to sample a range of their dishes, but until then, I'm underwhelmed.",1
"I want to give 5 stars but something was just lacking. Definitely not our server, Ted. He was excellent. Made us feel very welcome, offered excellent suggestions, was there when we needed him and just an overall, friendly, likable guy. I think maybe because we were put in an upstairs room, away from all the action of the main restaurant, in kind of an odd table, maybe that's what it was? Or maybe because I was not ""blown away "" by my steak. Here's what we had and my take on it n nCrab soup Delicious. Not a heavy, cream base, it was a bit like a bisque, had excellent flavor, plenty of crab. n nCarpaccio appetizer I enjoyed it, but it was not the best. I would probably skip and try something different. n nRib cap it was suggested by Ted since we were leaning towards the bone in ribeye. So glad we tried it, best cut of meat. Very tender with a really nice flavor, I would definitely order it. n nPrime New York Strip it was just ok. They did cook it a perfect medium rare, so no complaints there, but definitely was not as tender or flavorful as the rib cap. For what I paid, I would have expected way better. I added the butter poached lobster tail to it, it was standard. And small n nSides Baked potato wow, just a darn good baker, and plenty for two people. nMac and cheese yeah, I know, we went on starch overload here, so probably should have tried the Brussels sprouts or I thought the okra looked interesting. It was a little heavy on the truffle oil. It was definitely good, but I've actually had better at other places. n nDessert Um, I have to jump on the bandwagon here.sticky toffee pudding.DONE! you will never have anything else like it. I'm pretty sure I've since had dreams about it. n nNice touches the French pressed coffee and the presentation it comes with, Amaretto, Bailey's and Chambord frozen spoons if you are into that. I just like mine plain with cream, it was excellent. n nWe had a great time, thanks to the awesome Ted, as well as the other people who served us that evening. I don't think the restaurant is pretentious or snooty, we did not encounter any of that. But, would I ever go back for dinner, probably not. I could get equally good steaks in my opinion over at Mastros in Crystals. However, would I come in for a night cap of sticky toffee pudding and coffee, absolutely.",2
This place really deserves the 5 stars. its a tad bit pricy but worth it. I had the shrimp with the medium hot n juicy marinade they got. let me say that medium had a real good kick to it. I also ordered the soft shell crab basket and it comes with fries deep fried soft shell crab and it also is really great. But the softshell crab basket is not that big at all. People need to try this place for sure. I would give it the full 5 stars it deserves but its jus a lil pricy like I said in the begining with 1lb of shrimp. The soft shell crab basket and 2 drinks it came out to 30. we left there hungry because its very little for wat you get. But definitely worth chrcking it out,2
"Love M S food and although I don't shop in here every week then I do pop in a couple of times a month to stock up. n nFood is still good quality I used to work in food manufacturing for an M S producer so I know how strict they are on quality. n nPlus, I'm very impressed with their ever increasing range of gluten free foods lots of things previously off limits are available here sauces, chicken in breadcrumbs, Christmas cakes, and all the 'bits' needed for Chrimbo the food catelogue is sheer food porn and all products are clearly labelled as to whether they are suitable for dietary requirements. n nIt is worth popping in the meal for u00a310 is good value for two people or several nights meals if you live alone and they sometimes have good deals on booze champagne which is lovely at u00a316 a bottle currently . n nYes, it can be a bit rammed on a Saturday afternoon, but sharpen those elbows to grab your goodies. This is my pampering place for good quality food, so M S, I love ya!",2
"Everything is wrong with this restaurant service, food, beverage, decor, convenience, etc. nMy family came from CA to Las Vegas on spring break, and it happened I bought a Groupon for Da Lat Restaurant, near where the Palms, where we stayed. nWe thought why not try this restaurant since it had a 4 star rating. We were wrong ! We came in and were seating promptly, but we never had a server again to take our order until 10 minutes later. We had to flag the server down to take order even though the restaurant was not at all busy. nThe menu items we wanted to order half was not available. No coconut ! They sold more than 1000 Groupons, I expected them to be ready for a crowd. There was another item on the menu that I ordered was not available, but I forgot what it was. Anyway, we ordered four items egg rolls soaked in old oil , Vietnamese chicken noodle soup had a strong sesame taste, which kill the flavor of any chicken , beef noodle soup, which was fine, and a rice dish with pork meatloaf, shredded pork, and charbroiled pork never came until half an hour later that we reminded them that we were missing a dish . nThere were 2 servers with around 10 tables in the restaurant. They have to serve, make drinks from scratch, buss tables, bring out the order, etc. Now when new guests came in I had to tell them that ""you have new guests coming in, "" that was when I knew this restaurant was way unorganized. I could feel that other guests were disappointed too. Most guests had to wait so long for order taken. nThe decor of this restaurant filled with sceneries from Vietnam, could have filled with lots of photos from Da Lat. We had to literally walked through the restaurant kitchen to get to the restroom filled with cleaning chemicals and open electrical outlet . nI wished that this restaurant would have run by a Vietnamese family instead of Chinese because the food didn't reflect Vietnamese, at all.",1

This restaurant is one of our favorites. The owner Frank and his servers are attentive and the food is outstanding. The portions are super large and always fabulous the next day. I would highly recommend this restaurant and would consider them the best Italian in the Phoenix area. My favorite meal is their Chicken Parmesan and anything with Vodka sauce!,2
"I am an unabashed baseball geek, so suffice it to say that I'd enjoy a baseball themed steakhouse. This place has amassed some amazing memorabilia over the years and it is cool to check it all out. n nD C's is always bumping during Spring Training, personally I am one to avoid big crowds and long waits, and have found that I enjoy the memorabilia and the food just as much during the other 10 months of the year. A wide variety of nice steaks, ribs, and other tasty grilled meats. Great place to go with your buddies after a day of golf. n nThe last time I was there, Don, who as one might imagine, owns the place, joined us at our table for a few minutes and told us some great stories about ballplayers that he's met, and even gave us a box of candy for free. Very nice and genuine guy, and anyone who loves baseball as much as I do is probably a good man in my book.",2

It was slow and still took 20 minutes for us to get sat at a table. nI really wish we wouldn't have waited. nOur server forgot to bring silverware, so we didn't have silverware for about 25 minutes after we were sat. nSLOW service. No refills unless we flagged her down. The food was meh. nIf you look at my reviews I'm very fair. nI don't like giving places bad reviews, but this place was just horrible. nWe spoke to the manager and he gave us a ""discount "". 7 dollars off a 72 dollar check. nMight as well not even bother. Way to offend us. nWe will definitely not be back. nNot worth the time, the money, nothing.",1

"I was sort of shocked to see so many 5 star reviews. I went this morning, and I was less than impressed. The donuts were not very visually attractive. I'm not sure if someone new did the decorating? The flavors were ok. The fruity pebble covered cake donut was marginal at best. The cereal was not crunchy, but more soggy from being dipped in the frosting. I might try this place again since it does have such stellar reviews. Maybe they were just having an off morning? It was definitely more random grocery store quality rather than a gourmet donut experience.",1
"Stopped by here as I had a few hours to kill before my flight outta Vegas earlier this month. I can't say much about the top rope area, but my biggest complaint is the tape on routes in the bouldering area what the heck! Half of the pieces were peeled off or falling away. The start writing was barely legible, I don't know if they were just meant to all be unrated or if they're just so old they had faded away already. Lastly some of the tape patterns were so similar, I wasn't sure whether I was off route half the time. n nThat said, the day pass fee was cheap enough and some of the problems I worked on were pretty fun. They have an interesting albeit short bouldering arch cave, with a slightly taller wall behind it. I wouldn't mind stopping back again if I'm in the area, but honestly I'd rather climb outdoors at Red Rocks.",1
"This place is an absolute joke if you have a 9 5 job and try to go after work.

"I am so HAPPY they opened one up in AZ! When I lived in Denver this was the spot to go to! Since its so good, the wait is pretty long. They have an awesome system down which they text you when your table is ready! Good thing Nordstrom Rack and all the other places are around the restaurant so you can go shopping! There is FREE water and coffee in the back which I LOVE! It's like getting free bread or chips and salsa when you go to a dinner restaurant! You can't go wrong with anything on their menu!

This Walmart or like my friends and I refer to as scaremart is just that. There are always homeless people lurking around and begging for money. I've been approached several times. The inside of the store isn't any better. It is rarely well stocked and not very clean. I only go here because of prices and convenience. I avoid going here at night and alone because of crime.,1

"Foodies, don't let this place deceive you! They are running two businesses under one guise. The first is regular ol' ho mogwai not cute furry creature, but basically Chinese for gringo food. There are two menus here and depending on what you look like yes, I know it's discrimination they will give you the blue menu or the pink menu. Sometimes they may give you both if you appear to be down with it! The pink menu is full of sweet and sour chicken and other morsels Americans expect in their Chinese ""adventures "" The blue menu is the Chinese menu translated in to what is at times, very humorous Engrish . You may have to ask for this beauty. n nThe clientele in the eat in part of the business is largely Chinese and this usually speaks volumes to the quality to price ratio at Chinese places. The Chinese patrons typically receive an earthenware pot of soup called ""daily soup "" that is totally free. The soup is different everyday, and often has ingredients favored in Chinese medicine. My kids like it, so we get it. It isn't offered to everyone, so if you want it, ask for it. n nWe have a few favorites here that include seafood chow fun with gravy , monks platter an array of mushrooms unlike any I've ever known, paired with tofu , stir fry fish with vegetables sauteed whitefish with Ginger and baby bok choy , something that I believe is called Peking rib a staple at most tables, crunchy red goodness , fried calamari, and many others currently evading me. n nA portion of our family is Chinese, and so we always celebrate Chinese New Year with wonderful seafood dishes. We have typically shared this meal at C Fu to watch their lion dance performance. This year C Fu canceled the show, so we couldn't see paying twice as much for food that definitely isn't twice as good. We fed 16 people for around 120 dollars this year. It was awesome! n nDo know that the loss of a star is only due to the fact that the staff is discriminatory. We have come in before before our Chinese relatives arrive and chopsticks and tea cups were removed from the table. The staff can be quite brusque until you get to know them. We've been coming in for two years now and it has taken this long for them to start being friendly. The food, however, supersedes any lack of manners in the staff. Go in and make the decision that their antics are comical rather than hurtful and like the platter clean!",2
"You get what you pay for and for what I paid, I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary for a burger joint.

Prolly won't visit again I'd rather go up the street to Micky D's for a Big Mac.",1
Seriously took 20 minutes just to get one burrito from the drive through! Haven't even taken a bite yet so can't comment on the food yet. Just super bugged that it's taking so long.,1
"This place is awful. Pricey and tiny portions, nothing we ordered tasted good let alone fresh, near was very dry and obviously freezer burned, I honestly can say I couldn't tell what was the pork and what was the chicken, the gyozu had no flavor, the menus are a mess, it's like seven sheets of paper written in magic marker, with no description of the food, the rest is in Japanese, handy if you're Japanese but sucks to be you if you aren't. The server had no idea what was going on, stay away from this place please, try almost any other spot in China town, you'll have better luck",1

"Sunday red eye on 5 12 13. The initial security check line was okay, but the security screen was a nightmare. Multiple lines merging into one with no order, running out of plastic trays, so scans, etc. For a city that thrives on tourism, I expected things to run a lot more smoothly.

"Ok. So I just left this place and I must say the atmosphere is amazing and the music is great. They are also open late, which is wonderful because I stay up late! n nUnfortunately, their main point is lacking the food itself. The broth was basically onion water and no amount of hoisin or Sriracha would make it better. And I swear that was mint and not basil. I just think they don't know much about Vietnamese food. They should switch to something else. I have never not finished a bowl of pho. Ever. I also never pause when I'm eating it. Lol. But this bowl was hard to get through and I didn't even make it all the way. n nThe service also was not great. We waited like 20 min before our order was even taken. And when the waitress came to take it, she walked up and just looked at me with an expressionless face. Awkward. I ordered, and it took like another hour to even get just my pho out which should only take 10 min , and another 10 min for my boyfriend's rice. He was disappointed too. 11 dollars for something so small. Didn't even taste like the Vietnamese dish. Anyway, we felt ignored all night and the waitress was awkward and emotionless. nI usually tip pretty well because I work in the food service industry as well, but I just couldn't tip well. I'm sorry.",1
"Horrible! nService was way slow, waitress was I in another world, tells in salsa and drinks took forever. nI order the fish tacos, asked for sour cream instead of the spicy sauce they use.

"Largest standard room in Las Vegas. My personal favorite! Great service. The phantom of the opera show is there. TAO pool bar is close which looks like MTV spring break every day. Concierge is very helpful so use it if you need tickets or advice on what to do in Vegas. They can usually set up up with something you wouldn't get otherwise. Saves time too. Get a players club card because they give you points based on how much time you play not how much you gamble. Who knows it might get you something somewhere. The most beautiful of all the hotels and its easy to find things once you get to know the layout, not like a maze like other casinos. I always stay here unless its booked, if they are full go to Treasure Island across the street, a best bang for the buck strip hotel.",2

"Great place, fast friendly service. Subs were great, cheese evenly distributed and meat seasoned well just the way a sub should be! Highly recommend coming here to get a bite eat!",2
It took forever to get through the line and then to order. My favorite sandwich is the bacon turkey bravo and my favorite soup is the broccoli cheddar. When my food was delivered to my table the soup wasnt very warm. Panera Bread makes me miss Paradise Bakery. I am accustomed to getting a cookie with my meal but not here at Panera Bread.

"This has to be Edinburgh's number one deli. This little place is absolutely packed with sauces, wines, cheeses and meats. n nThe front of the shop is quite narrow and is filled with Italian foods and has fresh meats and cheeses on offer at the deli.

Indeed, it is so high that the staff don't use a ladder to get a bottle down, but instead use a gripping device.I would be very nervous indeed using that, many bottles would end up smashed on the floor if it was me! n nThe shop is full of tempting smells and the smell of fresh bread always leads you to the back of the shop. And there you find a large selection of Italian wines, a lot of very good red wines. n nA good bottle of red, with some fresh bread and cheese.I would say that's a good shop!",2
"I had to try this place not just because of it's absolutely hilarious name but because I'd heard it was super cheap eats. Am a cheap eater? No. But was hoping this was that rare place that served good food at super low prices. Basically, a place where they realizes their prices are too low but are too afraid to alienate their new customers. n nVerdict? Kind of. n nHad the pork chop over rice and beef ramen. n1 Pork chop over rice I'm told you have to ask for it crispy to get it.crispy. Not sure why they do that. I did not know this when ordering so was disappointed at the lack of.crispiness. It was also underseasoned. Definitely added a lot of salt to this bad boy. Otherwise it was pretty good. The egg that came with it had a nice, soft yolk in the middle. My mom just learned how to cook the eggs that way and we both agree it's awesome. Ask for this dish crispy and you won't be disappointed. n2 Beef ramen Again.underseasoned. But have to say this is some of the best beef I've had here in Las Vegas. Nice and soft with a lot of flavor. Just wish they added more salt or soy sauce to the soup base. The noodles themselves aren't great basically the ramen you'd get in most instant ramen. Nothing like the ramen at Monta. But the overall dish is pretty awesome. Definitely a step below Monta but at half the price. I could eat that beef with any dish and be happy. n nOverall.a good option and happy they opened. I can't say that about most of the Asian restaurants in town. Most of what we have is a dime a dozen. Big Wong stands out for quality for the price.",2

"Here Is the synopsis. n n1. Walked in at 4 pm. THREE employees walked by us and COMPLETELY ignored us. A server came out after 10 minutes and asked us how many. He grabbed menus and literally left us 20 feet behind him. We assumed he wanted us to follow him. n2. On RECOMMENDATION we ordered two appetizers. Calamari and artichoke dip. The artichoke dip was ok. The calamari I GUARANTEE is a very low end pre breaded frozen product. It was WAY overcooked therefore chewy and tough. n3. Daughter ordered a house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Dressing was a very odd texture. Overly thick and odd taste. n4. Entrees were Pizza.it was decent. Spicy sausage pasta.it was laughable very poor quality. Tortellini Alfredo.it was decent. Pesto Chicken pasta.it had ZERO flavor. I do not know how that can happen but it did. n5. Three out of the four sets of silverware we were given had food remnants stuck to them. We asked for new silverware. Server response was ""Oh Boy "" New silverware arrived.getting better tis time two out of the three were dirty. We wiped off the silverware with our napkins and went on. n nAll in all very disappointed. We had medium hopes and were totally let down.",1

Some of it looked too bad to try and all the things I tried including snails, octopus, frog legs, sushi rolls and hibachi were AWFUL. The only good things were the salty shrimp and my glass of Coke. Note to self never eat any buffet again. I think it was all radioactive products that Japan is dumping on America.",1
"What can I write that already hasn't? Excellent all the way around from service, pricing and taste! This time I had the catfish. Awesome cornmeal batter and flavorful catfish.

"It's quick, tasty, healthy and affordable what more do you really need to know? n nOh so you want to know about the food well it's pretty much rice and meat but done the right way. This is chicken or beef chopped up and put on top of either brown or white rice, I always go brown since it's better for you. The mixture is topped off with some magic sauce which is Korean BBQ sauce which is a lot like teriyaki sauce. You can also get veggies too but I rarely do. n nI usually get the combo plate which adds a little salad with some tasty sesame dressing and an orange. I think the price is about 9 OTD and is enough food for at least one meal if not a meal and little snack later. n nThey also have a punch card program so you can earn free meals too.",2

"I've never had any inclination to go here, but when it was booked for a recent Yelp outing, I went with an open mind. Unfortunately my predisposition was proven correct. The service was intermittent and fairly dismal. The food was mediocre and really didn't leave much of an impression not a good one at least . two salads at the table arrived ""undressed "" and upon inquiry were told that the kitchen had ""run out of the balsamic vinaigrette "" which usually came on the salad. We maybe rather loudly suggested that maybe someone run to the Tesco across the road to pick up our own salad dressing! A bottle of balsamic vinegar soon arrived at the table and free drinks were offered as compensation for the those who'd ordered salad. Two steaks at the table looked promising upon arrival but the rare was closer to well done although the medium rare was at least about medium. n nDessert tea or coffee was never offered after our plates were cleared away, we had to send someone to get the bill for our table. The vague saving grace was that they gave us 30 off our entire food bill because we had a few students at the table. They offer a 30 student discount . n nI think we all left feeling rather underwhelmed. With so many options for eating out in Edinburgh, Biblos does not warrant a repeat visit.",1
"Hike 4 for 2010 was North Mountain Park. Got there around 10 30am on a Sunday. Sunny and wonderful weather! We got a parking near Trail 44. We hiked up trail 44, it was strenuous but we needed a little more so we went down the pavement and off to this little trail that led us to trail 101. Cool! It was a little declines inclines and between two mountains. The scenary was goregous! We walked until we hit trail 100 and we took a left. Walked and walked. Watched people walk their dogs people riding horses. Neat! We got to where the trail ended. Hum? Went off to trail 60 then. Another strenuous hike and it was a circle. Circled back to trail 100 and we back tracked all the way back. 3 1 2 hours later we were back at the car. n nMan, my calves are SORE today!",2

"Wednesday night Happy Hour A ! Wow! Dined here for lunch and brunch but last night was my first happy hour and I highly recommend it. We did wine by the glass 6, red or white, happy hour special although on this night they were offering half off bottles, which was awesome. We shared several appetizers, including sushi. I'm a rabid Kerry Simon fan and the happy hour selections and atmosphere topnotch. Had to order my beloved crispy rice topped with tuna even though it's not on the happy hour menu. Comfortable lounge seating and great lighting in bar area. Diverse crowd and zen enough that we could really talk but still a fun atmosphere. Loved it.",2

"RUDE EMPLOYEE! I went into this juice bar one morning in a hurry. First impression, EXPENSIVE for a juice and you needed glasses to read the tiny written menu. The smoothie I ordered was 7.50 quite a lot I would say . I ordered from the girl standing behind the counter, then the phone rang. She proceeded to take the call to discuss daily sales and how much the shop was making each day with the person on the other line. She did not apologize or excuse herself while taking this call. As I waited she walked around cleaning things up while on the phone. No, not starting to make my smoothie, just talking on the phone about how much money the place is making, REALLY? The person with me never got to order, we both walked out, no time in my day for that. Better tell that owner they just lost 2 smoothie sales that day and possible repeat customers.",1

I am back for a 2nd year in a row! This time I tried the thai steak salad because I have been eating like no tomorrow on this trip. I needed some ruffage to counter all the food! The salad is on point. The flavors reminded me of Thai yum spicy sour salads. We also brought 3 other newbies here and they enjoyed their meals as well. One of the better burger joints in Vegas.,2
"Lowest quality of any AYCE sushi restaurant I've ever experienced in Vegas. n nI expect previously frozen, gassed fish at any AYCE place but not color added fish. Unless I missed a new trend in genetic engineering, there is no such thing as bright fuchsia colored tuna or brilliant orange salmon. What's worse is many items tuna, hamachi, salmon, shrimp have a dry, rubbery texture as if it was previously frozen and thawed using tap water. n nThe rice is seasoned well but is so compacted, it's the densest sushi I've ever had. n nDecent creativity but by the end of the meal, I never wanted to hear ""yum yum sauce "" again. This mayo based concoction is slathered on almost everything. Cloying and fatty, even hot tea can't cut its mouth grip. n nService was OK, I mean I did get a menu, water, food, and the check but with every additional order, I felt less like a welcome guest and more like a theif hacking away at the profit. n nMaybe a bad night? I doubt it. The fundamentals are wrong. Not worth it considering how many better AYCE restaurants dot Vegas.",1
"Eat is my new favorite downtown venue. It's located in the more sketchy part of DT, but with good food and good vibes, it's worth the risk. This venue has plenty of character, reminiscent of either Portland or Frisco spots, but beware, it's first come, first serve. Prepare yourself for some downtime because it can get pretty busy during lunch hours. It seems as if they have locked in the perfect spot right behind Container Park for when hipsters, foodies and white collars have an appetite. The only thing they are missing as far as my concern? Alcohol. n nTHE MUST TRIES nVeggie Burger nShrimp and Grits nBiggnets",2
"Merriam Webster defines ""Caf u00e9 "" as follows. ""A usually small and informal establishment serving various refreshments as coffee . "" Can you get coffee here? No. Well, to be honest, I have never asked for coffee, but who would at a Chinese. I mean.Asian restaurant. So this so called ""Caf u00e9 "" has no coffee. Is that a problem? No. First of all, they do have 2 3 of the definition correct. It is small, and informal. For me, that is close enough. I do have to say, though, that for an order at the counter ""Asian "" restaurant, it is extremely clean and new inside. And the staff is extremely friendly. In fact, you can ask them about their food and they actually have an answer! Now friends, this is extremely peculiar for such a restaurant. This friendliness also lends itself to some flexibility when it comes to ordering. They will let you substitute meats, adjust heat of a dish, etc., without blinking and eye. And all this for dirt farm poor prices. The lunch specials are an insane bargain with all kinds of sides. And for dinner, although it is a bit more expensive, they load you up with tons of food. n nBut this begs the question you are all wondering. Is this ""Caf u00e9 "" at least ""Asian? "" Merriam Webster defines ""Asian "" as follows. ""Of, relating to, or characteristic of the continent of Asia or its people. "" So do they have Russian food here? No. Do they have Vegemite here? No. Do they even have Korean food or Japanese food? No. This is truly Chinese food, without question. And it is an outstanding example of Chinese cuisine. Everything is made to order, extremely fresh, and very light and authentic sort of the anti Panda Express. And considering this place will make your food just about as quickly, without having to wait in line with a bunch of mouth breathing yahoos, I would highly recommend a visit to Asian Caf u00e9, even if the name is completely and utterly misleading. And besides, the name still makes a lot more sense than Panda Express. I mean, can you eat Panda there? Do they have Pandas working in the kitchen? Do they have a Panda petting zoo in there somewhere? Would you want that where you eat anyway? I hear those things are dirty, ornery, and smelly.",2
Tried to use a gift card purchased from the Blue Burger in Peoria as a gift. The owner would not accept it and the manager felt bad and offered us a desert. It was disappointing how they handled this situation. I don't plan on coming back but to the one in Peoria so we can use the gift card.,1
"This place is a lot of fun to go to! it is not the nightclub feel at all.

"And to think I loved this place as a tourist. Whenever I'd visit Phoenix I'd eat at Encanto. Now that I live here, you can't pay me to go. The food is average at best especially considering the prices and the duck pond is nothing short of disgusting. n nBesides, if you have kids like I do you're almost required to take them to feed the ducks which means you're walking through what the ducks ahem leave behind. Multiply that times 100 and imagine what the restaurant's floor is covered in. I'm just saying.",1
"First of all, the atmosphere and decor of this place is quite nice. But I would never come here for the food again, which is overpriced and fails to deliver. On the other hand, with the right people, and some nice clothes, it would be nice to sit for a bit and pay for 15 cocktails, I suppose. n nMy suggestion would be to eat across the way at Cowboy Ciao and maybe stop over for a cocktail or two. Service was 'okay' the two times I was there, however. n nNote if you do not frequent restaurants that cannot maintain proper bathroom hygiene, do NOT patronize this restaurant.

"Our first time here after a long but great day at the ball park. A little bit of a wait since the patio was closed for a private party. Totally worth the wait.

He had the 5 3 shredded beef enchiladas and I had the 26 3 fish enchiladas. Very, very good. We liked it not just for what it is but also because of what it isn't.

"This is technically just for the website since I've never been to AZ. They supposedly have a regular retail store. n nAnyway, the website is very easy to navigate and has a great look to it. I was searching for some inexpensive Juicy Couture items esp. for pets and I stumbled across this place. It's run by MLB players' wives. In any case, the website is well done in the sense that it updates immediately. I bought the last JC collar set and when I checked back later, it was already off the site. This minimizes the need to contact someone back saying that the item is out of stock. n nI opted for regular shipping, which came out to 4.95 for my order that's cheaper than most shippers on eBay which is where I was also looking for JC stuff and it was UPS ground. I ordered around 12 on Tuesday, it arrived Friday. Yes! My order even came wrapped with pink tissue. My JC dog tee had a tag, the collar set did not. The items are a bit outdated, from probably a 2006 collection but whatever. n nI would order again from them. In fact, I'm debating if I want to order the other two tees.

Scored a very cute polka dot halter on the 10.00 rack too. Gotta love that! n nOverall the price point was decent, but frankly the dresses I bought were so cute I wasn't really comparison shopping.

"I am easily impressed by mediocre Chinese food. This place isn't horrible but its not good either. n nYou get a lot of food per dollar and it comes out quick but it just doesn't seem even remotely fresh.

I sent it back nicely and told him that his pad thai is my absolute favorite and today it just isnt right. Well, he started talking to the cook and she got mad, said she didnt put fish sauce in it and that something is wrong with me because they make it the same way everytime. Ok. Then Mr Wong, takes it in the back and tastes it and proceeds to tell me that it must be me because it tastes fine and that maybe it was just too spicy for me. I have eaten the pad thai here over a dozen times now I order it the same exact way everytime. So much for awesome customer service. I wont be back.",1
"Coco's is one of those fun, old style breakfast lunch places that somehow has managed to survive into the 21st Century sadly, others like Howard Johnson's have not!

And it all sucked! Prawns and scallops were raw. At least sear the dang thing, the last time I checked I was at a French restaurant, not out having sushi. Oyster pot pie was disgusting. Might as well have gone to Marie calendar's for that. Petite filet was decently flavored, but a bit dry.

"You know whats really fucked up about this place? Its consistency. For instance, if you eat in the dining room you get a burrito so damn big that you cant finish it! Seriously, this thing was humongous and pretty much full on burrito madness. It tasted alright, very in line with Chipotle or any other shitty corporate burrito joint, nothing special I assure you except for its girth. n nSo on our return trip to there airport we deiced to get a burrito but this time ordered it from the counter instead and had it to go.

This burrito was so chicken shit and terribly small we wondered if there was a problem, kids size maybe? Anyways of course I asked and was told that was the normal to go size. n nThat's pretty much bullshit anyway you cut it.

"Went to Las Vegas over the weekend with the family including my 15 months old daughter and nephew and a niece. Since we will need a car seat, decided to rent a car instead of taking taxis and lugging around a car seat. n nFound the price of Fox rental to be very good. The location of the rental was off the airport so we had to take addititonal shuttle from rental center in Airport to the rental place outside of the airport. It was a little inconvenient but not a big deal. Although it took some time to complete the rental since we were trying to upgrade the vehicle, the agent at the rental center was very nice and helpful. n nThe problem was the car itself and the attendant at the gate. The car was not ready and exterior was not very clean. As I started to drive out to the gate for exit, I noticed that there was a light popping up. I asked the gate attendant what it was for . he said I needed to pump air . Umm, isn't that YOUR JOB? Furthermore, the attendant went around to check the vehicle to note the prior damages. Luckily I checked the car first because the attendant did not indicate the damage on the front bumper that was there. I told the attendant and he said it was just a scratch. SOOOO . IT'S STILL PRIOR DAMAGE. Lucky I pointed that out because when I return the car, the agent asked about the front bumper scratch. And about the light . DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO GO AND PUMP THE AIR IN THE TIRE FOR YOU? Needless to say, I drove around AS IS . if it gets damaged, oh well! n nOverall, the price was good and the agent was nice and hence 2 stars instead of 1 but not worth the hassle and the crappy vehicles they have.",1

Their chocolate croissants were the perfect flakiness too little chocolate inside but the buttery croissant made up for it. The Nutella crepe was heaven the next time I'll get some ice cream to go with it! The only thing I wish I'd tried was their gelato guess I had to save something to look forward to on our next trip! n nTheir cakes on display were also amazing reminded me of Cake Boss and Ultimate Cake Challenge on a smaller scale.

"We went here after visiting the website and expecting some pretty good food and drinks. This place is as ""Americanized "" as any Mexican place I've been. The interior, service, and food is mediocre but everything after that goes way downhill. The chips and salsa were very sub par but the fajitas actually had a little seasoning on them too much to ask for most of the time . The worst part about the restaurant was the margaritas. I came in expecting a good drink after seeing it was voted best margarita in Charlotte and left wondering how 600,000 people could be so wrong. They have sweet and sour mix by the gallon and that's all the drink tasted like. Fresh lime juice is not bright green, so the drink shouldn't be. I even overheard some drunk young dude who knew no better comment on how good his margarita was while sitting at the bar. Thar poor soul has no clue what a mans drink is good tequila, grand marnier cointreau, and fresh lime juice. Mine had the first two but I couldn't taste anything but artificial mix. n nGo there if you want a step up from Taco Bell for three times the money! Otherwise seek out something more authentic.",1

"The mettle of a restaurant is measured by how the staff reacts when they mess up. In my case, after waiting 28 minutes for poached eggs, I went up to the counter to ask where my order was. I was asked to wait a few more minutes, so I questioned whether my order was even started these are poached eggs after all . My question was met with lots of attitude from Nicole, who was unapologetic and informed me that it ""takes time "" to sautee the vegetables spinach LOL that come with my eggs. A little dumbfounded, I waited for an apology, a gesture of regret, an attempt to make it right, but that's apparently beyond the customer service capabilities of this place. So I requested my money back, went home, and had eggs ready in 90 seconds.",1

It reminded me of the flat frozen burgers you get at an amusement park stand. My fries were limp and greasy. The onion rings were just the big fat run of the mill rings that have no taste and were probably frozen. nWe had a coupon for buy one meal get one free, I don't know if that's why the food was so bad, but as soon as I started taking pictures of my food, one of the workers ran over to ask us if everything was alright.

The shells are also fried until their extremely crispy, so you can actually eat it! You MUST try this! n n3rd item always depends on my mood. This time, it's chripy duck with drunken noodle. If you ever had pad see you, it tastes like that with lots of basil. The fried duck is crispy and moist, yummmoooo. n nIf you never had good Thai food before, this is the place to come.

While not Bikram, the room was toasty This place is definitely fancy. and the people are definitely GYM people. Debra, the yoga instructor was amazing. n nAt first I was put off by the loud dance music during the beginning of our practice, but after a few challenging poses, I didn't let it affect my state of mind. breathe. n nThe pace was quick, a little too quick at times for my breathing, but what made the class special, was the special attention that Debra offered. I felt rewarded for using my breath when she came over to give me an extra stretch. When I asked for help with a pose, she not only answered, but later showed how I could get into the same pose from a different place. n nThe program was challenging and different from my usual practice at home, if you're NOT a gym person, you may not like it. But as a Yogi, you should also be able to feel gratitude and joyfulness wherever you practice. So if you feel like some rock and roll yoga, I highly recommend. Namaste.",2
"well lats nght I did not fell like cooking so I ordered pizza. the comercials on TV had been haunting me for moths with thoese "" Pa Zones things "" They looked good on TV but when they arived at mt house the sise was something a bit larger than A hot pocket. I had the italian meat and the buffalo they were good dont get me wrong, but i guess I got what I payed for when they are only two for five dollars. The new item pizza rollers witch you recived four per order for five dollars had pepperonni in side witch was nice. the cheese sticks how ever my dog if I had one would not even eat not good card board yo do not get this joke of a cheese stick no real cheese just crust and powdered cheese. n nthe food did come it a speedy 20 min or so, when the gut pulled out the two small boxes i thought it was a joke. next time I will just get a good extra large pizza nto from these guys. fell sucker to the smell o vision again.",1
"I never write a review until I leave but this place has me a bit upset. When I walk in the guy say you should sit at the bar but oh you can sit anywhere but the bar is best. Ok I take it I need to sit at the bar. So I order food. Just 10 wings. They bring me only 9. Yep I'm at bit pissed off. I pay for 10 I'd like to have 10. If I ever return to Pittsburg I don't think I'd come back. Service is like 90 percent of the dining experience. When I told my bartender she just blew it off. I guess because they are by the baseball field they can do whatever! I'm so not happy! I also order tequilla Dobel 15 when I have gotten it for 4. Stick to beer. 3.75 7.00 n nFor those who care or dare to try maybe you'll have a better experience than me the wings are good, all 9 if them.",1
"A lovely little bakery and shop in the fabulous stockbridge. We stopped here for a quick pastry as you can see from my photo, it looks and tasted delicious and a latte. Both I cannot fault. I also had great glee at looking at all the shelves of delicious food, pastas etc.oh and did I mention that they have a section at the front of the shop that sells fresh bread, salami and cheese! We bought some and i will definatley be back Made me smile",2
"WORST Vegas experience EVER! n nWhere do I start? First of all, my husband was attending a conference, we made our reservations for a King room 4 months in advance at the conference price. When we arrived, we were checked into a double TWIN room. When we made this mistake known to the front desk they told us "" we are very busy with another big conference near sold out. We can see if tomorrow we can accommodate you better "". It was late, we were both very tired from the 8 hour drive, so we agreed. n nThe next day in between my husband's VERY important conference, he attempted multiple times to remedy the mistake. Each time he was told ""well, maybe we can change your room this afternoon, after housekeeping? But we are near sold out, so we just don't know "". n nAt 1 pm the second day of our stay, we were given another room. We packed up all our stuff luggage made our way to the next, supposedly correct room.MUCH to our dismay, this room was also.you guessed it.a double TWIN. So, we slupped our luggage BACK down to the front desk to AGAIN attempt to rectify the mistake. n nFINALLY, on day 2 of our 3 day stay.we obtained our correct room. Albeit, the crapiest King room they probably had, with a view of the dirty dusty, pipe filled roof of the ""good tower "". The wall was PAPER thin, the drunk guy next door kept smoking in his room despite the wing being ""smoke free "". I could actually SEE the smoke wafting under the adjoining door that incidentally, his drunk ass kept trying to open, day night . n nEach time we encountered the front desk person of the hotel, we were met with smiles apologies, but little else for these logistical mistakes. n nI mean, seriously? Doesn't the computer system KNOW which rooms are TWINS which are KINGS? Seems simple to me? n nAlso, in the land of complimentary hookers cocaine.all we got was a meaningless ""sorry "" from the front desk for this kind of minimum wage worker folly of errors? At least toss us a spa credit or something? For what we paid for this place.you'd think they could actually get the damn reservations right? n nWith all the competition places to stay in Las Vegas.shame, SHAME on ""Caesar's Shack "" for their lack of customer services mediocre facilities. n nI WILL NOT be planning another stay at this craptastic place EVER again! n nDo yourselves a favor stay next door at Bellagio or even at one of the older places like Luxor.I bet you'll get some ACTUAL customer service.",1
"we came because they received a review in the Airtran Airline magazine. So after we arrived in AZ. We went to check it out and was a little disappointed with the food and the slow service, but to be fair.we did like the atmosphere of the place. outdoor seating which is the only reason we gave it a 2star instead of a single star. n nWe ordered n n ""Wolf Pack "" 2eggs, bacon cheese between layers of hash browns. 9 n small amount of food didn't even include toast for nine bucks n n ""The Over Easy "" Toasted brioche with spinach, fried egg, natural jus with bacon scallions. 9 really bad.soggy bread.lots of spinach, hardly any bacon n nThe entrees where small and if you wanted to add a side to make it a reasonably sized breakfast it will cost you more.which made it expensive.like adding toast extra 1.5.Yikes!

So they watered it down. n n3 The food was just ordinary. n n4 The staff was annoying repeatedly trying to take out dishes away before we were done.

"Everything was wrong we will never return. First off our food took forever I felt bad for waiter he kept apologizing and explain the kitchen was backed up. The restaurant was not that busy.

"I took my S2000 here for an alignment on a recommendation from a friend, and I'm so glad that I did! The gentlemen working the front desk was chipper and talkative. When I mentioned the car I was asking them to service, the tech that was in the office stretched his arms out and said, ""My friend, you've come to the right place. "" It turns out the tech is a fellow Honda Acura enthusiast and sounded almost excited to help me out! n nHe drove the car onto the rack slowly, minding the lowered nature of the S2K. While he was doing his work we discussed all things Honda. He did not mind that I was in the shop, under the lift inspecting the undercarriage , giving my car a once over. Meanwhile, he's doing his job efficiently while giving me advice on how to modify it and get the most of a wonderful driving machine. n nPretty much, I'm happy as can be that I found a fellow enthusiast working right around the corner, who I know it out to do the best job he can on my vehicle. Definitely a reassuring feeling. n nWith all that being said, and as happy as I was with the service he, and the shop, had extended to me, the reason I am writing this review and rated it as such is because of the treatment I witnessed them giving other customers. n nWe've all had bad experiences with an auto shop at one time of another, and it seems like they can prey on women who typically don't have the knowledge of cars your average Joe would . As I was in the waiting room, the gentleman at the counter, as well as another tech, were talking with a woman about her car, fully explaining the situation she was in, giving her numerous options to take care of her vehicle's problems. Although they weren't directing this honesty and service my way, I really appreciated seeing it and made a mental note. n nBased on how they treated me, and the other customers in their shop, I would recommend Tucker Tire highly!",2
"Where to begin? Hmm. Went here with a large group of friends to watch the ASU vs. UofA game for the territorial cup. We were there for about 4 hours total, and for the first hour and 15 minutes we got to speak to our waitress exactly once. She took our initial drink order, delivered some beverages and then disappeared like a magician's assistant. When we managed to draw her attention after that obscenely long period of time to order food it took over half an hour to get anything. This included an order of chips and salsa something which is prepared by putting chips in a basket and pouring salsa into a bowl. When the food was delivered, it came out unaccompanied by the cocktails we had ordered. When we remarked on this, we were told the bar had run out of glasses and we would get our drinks as soon as they were cleaned. Our drinks were eventually delivered a while later and we managed to enjoy the game for a little while. During the game we had a few different waitresses come up to us to deliver a bowl of soup we hadn't ordered, a beer we hadn't ordered, three orders of chips and salsa we hadn't ordered presumably to make up for the fact that the first order had taken almost 40 minutes to get to our table , and two rum and cokes we didn't order. Upon learning that these cocktails weren't ours, the waitress who brought them decided to leave them sitting on the hostess stand which was near our table. A little bit later, one of my friends decided to order 4 ""Belfast Booms "" which is the Tilted Kilt's version of an Irish Car Bomb. These were delivered as follows the waitress first brought out 4 shots of Bailey's Irish Cream with no whiskey mixed in. The shots came out in two glass shot glasses, one plastic disposable shot glass, and one cocktail glass with an inch of Irish cream sitting in the bottom. She then said she would be right back. We assumed she was going back to get the glasses of Guinness the shots are supposed to be mixed with but apparently she didn't know that's how the drink is served because she didn't come back for about 15 minutes with the beers. The beer glasses per the description on the menu were supposed to have a half pint of Guinness to drop the shots in. They actually came out with quite a bit less a level low enough that dropping the shot glasses into the beer would have left the level of beer below the top of the shot glass. What was even more amusingly odd was the one drink served with the plastic shot glass as an experiment we dropped the shot into the Guinness in and confirmed what we thought would happen the plastic shot glass did not fall into the beer, it floated on top of the foam head. By the end of the evening, we got to the point where we were just amused by the utter incompetence and complete indifference we saw in every aspect of the service we received. I personally was confused by the fact that our waitress did not seem at all interested in serving a table that had close to 20 customers why would you not try to give good service to such a large group that would presumably be the source of a large tip? My portion of the bill was over 40, so if you do the math, she was risking 15 20 of a roughly 700 800 bill. My confusion was alleviated when we received our bills and found that while we were being billed individually, the restaurant treated the bills as if they were for a single large bill and automatically added the gratuity 18 to the total. It's really a shame because the food was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me to ever return there again.",1
"I can tell this place is going to be a new addiction. I liked the uptown store so much that I went to the Arcadia store right afterward to check out what they had. In both locations I had professional and very helpful service. And the merchandise was phenomenal. Ann Taylor. Banana Republic. Express. BCBG. Michael Kors. Max Studio. Elie Tahari. Michael Stars. Seven for all Mankind. BeBe. And that was all in the first 15 minutes! And 99 of it was under 20! Today, 60 got me a pair of Express pants, two designer blazers, a Max Studio blouse an adorable wide leather belt. Best. Shopping. Day. Ever. n nAlso, the consignment process was super easy. When I saw how awesome their inventory was I grabbed the two pairs of pants out of my car that were on their way to the tailor to be taken in. Why settle for slightly ill fitting pants when I can consign them and get new ones? Now I just need to stop myself from calling compulsively to see if I have store credit yet.",2
"I know they just opened are working out the kinks, but the wait staff needs more training the menu needs a bit of tweeking. THEY HAD NO VEGGIE BURGER! They need to learn from Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay. Had I known I would have brought a box of bocas made my own. Coffee came in espresso cups, which was probably an oversite. I have found that many places in Vegas substitute volume 11 music, for Ambience. However they did turn it down when we asked them, as we had to scream across the table at eachother. Hope they pull it together.",1
"Unfortunately, I can not recommend this complex. My family of 4 moved here almost a year ago, and I am counting down the days until my lease is up. There are countless issues since we have lived here. n n1. Maintenance requests will take a while to fill. Be warned I had put in a request that my dishwasher was leaving a nasty residue, and I receive a call almost 2 weeks later asking me if I had run vinegar through the wash. YES.I had, but thanks for asking 2 weeks later! I had also put in a maintenance request because the knob would fall off of my dryer often. It fell off a total of 3 times, each time necessitating an order for repair. When they finally replaced the dryer, it was much older and now does not turn off on its own. n n2. The water has been shut off 3 or more times. often without warning And, it's been off as long as an entire work day. Not to mention, I can never take a bath because the hot water runs cold in about 5 minutes. n n3. My parking spot is a good walk from my actual unit. When Brent was working here, he assigned me a new spot right in front of my apartment around 8 months into my lease. I was very grateful, come to find out management has reassigned my spot to the apartment next door. Brent told me this would be my new permanent spot, and not a temporary solution. Brent doesn't work here anymore, so I guess they don't feel the need to stand behind the word of a previous employee. n n4. Several of the staff are rude and unprofessional. I had to go have my gate card reprogrammed, and the office worker treated me like a nuisance. A different time, my husband went into the office to grab a package. The worker asked him to wait 10 minutes, because it had been crazy busy. Are you serious? To pick up a package? Get your act together! Hire more staff if you're that overwhelmed. Not to mention, almost every time I step foot in the office, there is a disgruntled renter complaining and asking to speak to the manager. n n5. I live on the second floor, and I hear every foot step up and down the stairs. I have a sleeping baby, and the noise level from the stairs has been difficult to deal with. n n6. My neighbors downstairs and next door both moved out around the same time. The units were renovated, and they woke up my sleeping baby almost every day for a couple weeks. So, be prepared for renovation above, below, and next door n n7. I went to change my air filter about a month ago on my own, because I wasn't going to wait a week for it to be changed , and it looked as if it hadn't been changed in about 3 years. we have lived here about 10 months I've never seen such a gross air filter n n8. They are raising their prices significantly, and the customer service has gone way down. My extended family used to live here when it was Acacia Creek under different management .and had a good experience. My fellow renters have told me they are having similar issues. n nI hope you have found this review helpful. It is very honest, but I would have appreciated having this information prior to move in.",1
"I would give them zero stars if I could. n nI took my daughter in for simple wart removal in the Gilbert office back in Sept of 2010. We saw a PA for several warts that he tried freezing. When he was done he estimated how many times he used the ""freezing agent "". We went in for 2 procedures but the warts only got worse instead of better. I decided to switch to a new dermatologist that did laser wart removal which finally took care of the warts. n nThe inability to get rid of the warts is not the issue I have since many dermatologists would have taken this route. My issue is with billing. Out of the blue I get a bill for 2 years ago. When I call the office saying I haven't seen them in two years they say it was for the invoice in Sept 2010 wart removal. I believe I made payment for that bill but how do I prove it now. I don't have that information any longer. If I hadn't paid it WHY didn't you bill me before now? Seems pretty shady to me. n nGo elsewhere! There are plenty of dermatologists in the area that can treat your issues and understand billing. You don't want to end up two years down the road with them billing you for services that you already paid for.",1
Is this place serious?! The Manager here needs to be fired. I had to interject at the Manager making excuses at a nearby table. What a joke. This place should be happy it is so busy. Hire more help and quit complaining to your paying customers. Time for a new restaurant at LAS.,1

So, now if I need some cash I have to make an extra trip to the bank. n nThanks again, Lucky Boy, for a great experience from a first time customer.",1
"SKIP THE LATE NIGHT MENU! n nOur group went here around 11 00 pm, so we missed the dinner menu. n nWe were all pretty hungry, so when I ordered the chicken skewer, and this pinky sized piece of meat on a stick 7, just one came out, I immediately had to order 2 other items knowing this would not come close to filling me up. So I ordered miso soup 5 . Did I get a bowl of hot steaming miso? NOPE. I got a shot of it. Everything was overly spicy also. Nose was running all night from the spiciness! Good thing it was not a first date! This place got an extra star for the mere fact it had a cool atmosphere and chic decor. n nService is Slllooooowww, even with the 4 different waiters we had. I will say they serve a killer Bloody Mary. If anything I would go back for the Bloody Mary. n nAll in all, you will leave starving and broke.",1

"In lieu of my favorite sushi joint in Vegas, my fellow yelper Liza L suggested we check out this ikazaya she's been wanting to try for a while. Located in Chinatown, the place was packed and filled with a mixed crowd of young and old. The walls were filled with their specials that were all fairly priced. Our party of four ordered a gamut of dishes to share including sashimi, sushi dishes, karaage chicken, pork cutlet that's supposed to have bacon in it? , squid, chicken gizzard, beef tongue, beef donburi and of course, the honey toast for dessert. The staff were attentive and the food came out pretty quick. n nI would recommend this place to my other Hawaii visitors who enjoy ikazaya style dining. Just be prepared to wait a while ours was over an hour so we just went downstairs to sing some karaoke and enjoy some soju to kill time.",2

"Driving I 10 we found ourselves hungry and in the area on a recent Sunday afternoon. Opted for something ""better "" than the usual fast food fare and dropped into the Claim Jumper for a late lunch. Place looked about 1 2 empty inside so we expected to be seated right away. Hostess told us 15 minute wait REALLY? for what? So before she could pigeon hole us into dining purgatory, we ducked into the bar and seated ourselves. Albert was tending the bar and waiting tables. Seems like he could have used another hand but he was attentive and pleasant. n nWe ordered a classic cheeseburger w fries and a citrus salad. The cheese burger was nothing to write home about. Ordered well done and came out pink but by this time we figured it wasn't worth wasting the time and sending it back. The salad was a miserable combination based of iceberg lettuce and overpowered by onion, all swimming in dressing. Bleah! n nCJ has a really nice setup, rich looking interior, well appointed, and attention to detail and design. The problem here is clearly the management. How can you expect to run a business much less STAY in business when you can't seat guests and serve in a half empty restaurant? I watched several families and couples who went through the same ""15 minute wait "" process the hostess tried to pin on us earlier. NO management was in sight during our 1 hour visit. I noted a sign on the door to the patio that said ""Patio Closed "" odd since there were several tables with guests dining out there. Maybe there is no help to serve the patio either? n nSo to sum up the experience The food was lousy and the management is non existent. If this is the norm here, CJ isn't long for this location. We won't be back. Fast food in Avondale looks a lot more attractive now.",1
Never ever will I go back to buy pizza wings again. This past Saturday I bought pizza wings for my family. I ordered plain wings they gave me hot wings.

Never ever call them back that your order is wrong they will put something in your food. Hell no will I ever ever go back again.,1
"My husband came with me to do laundry once. The laundromat is in the same area and of course while I was doing that, he hung out at The Blooze. I would go over in between loads. There was only one person working in the front of house. She was really nice. She didn't lose her cool at all when more people started coming in. She handled it well. Especially when a regular at the bar was giving her a hard time. She just went with the flow and eventually he left. They have 2 pool tables, darts and a stage for a band on the weekends. If you are already there when the band is setting up, you just get a stamp and don't have to pay cover, which is awesome. We ended up leaving before the band came on, but we plan on going back soon. It is a little bit of a dive, but everyone there was friendly. And they don't serve food, so eat before hand, but the drinks are cheap.",2
"Great place. We came here as a 9 top and they were able to sit us after 30 45 minutes reasonable for no reservation in Old town on a Saturday night . It can get a little crowded in the bar area up front. n nThe decor of this place is trendy classy. Looks like they took a bunch of props from Anthropologie and threw them in the restaurant and somehow managed to pull of a great rustic yet elegant look. Go see for yourself! There was also a live act playing that night everything from Clapton to Christmas music and while it was great, sometimes it was hard to hear talk over the music. Service was great as well our waitress was able to get us out the door in an hour and a half and that was with check splitting and multiple recurring drink orders! n nNow for the food. I was able to try the sliders, thai bbq ribs w mac n cheese, and the capicola ham flatbread. All of it was delicious. The meat just falls right off the bone on the ribs, and the sauce was fantastic. Most things are in the 16 30 price range. n nA !",2

Another friend got vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. He ate all of it with a smile on his face so I'm assuming it was good. Lol.

"Fun experience! No privacy. When we were seated I was disappointed that we were elbow to elbow with other couples on either side no chance of a romantic dinner or a private conversation for that matter . At one point the couple next to us leaned over to discuss one of our selections! The place is small and somewhat crowded. Although I frequent Japanese and Sushi restaurants this menu contained many things I had never had before. Most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size 14 25 . We chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections. nThe yellowtail tartar was great, the lobster ceviche was not so. The tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate popcorn shrimp size . We tried the house special a rainbow roll and Eel sushi. Both were good, but not my favorite rolls I'd ever had actually kind of plain. For dessert the bento box, essentially a souffl",2
"I was surprised to find an elective surgery consultation so poorly executed. After arriving on time, it was a 50 minute wait before I was seen I told the front desk I was leaving and only then was I seen . The technician who ran through the tests was nice but when it was complete I was placed in a dimly lit room where I waited another 40 minutes before the doctor arrived to review my results I was literally moments away from leaving again without the review when he arrived . The doctor was knowledgeable and the consultation was informative. Upon leaving the consultation I went to a financial coordinator. She was pleasant but I was surprised the price was so high given that I learned the surgery takes about 1 minute to complete and it was entirely automated. That left me wondering why I simply wouldn't find the cheapest facility who had the same technology. n nThe building, decor and equipment felt dated. Maybe from the mid 1990s. The newspaper accolades and patient letters on the dimly lit consulting room was from the mid 2000s. n nThis seemed like an outdated corrective eye surgery factory with premium pricing and a poorly executed customer experience. To have the right value offering they would need to cut their prices in half or do an overhaul of their patient experience. It should be a premium, red carpet experience at their current prices.",1
"I had high hopes for DTS especially given the interesting offerings available in Tivoli when it opened. My hopes diminished as I looked at the names of the restaurants and stores which were going to open on the property but I held out until I could actually visit. I have since been their twice and am comfortable enough to say that DTS is simultaneously a great disappointment for me but a need filler for Summerlin. n nWhy is it a need filler? Prior to opening, the nearest place to visit the stores such as Macy's, Dillards, Old Navy, Sephora, etc was Meadows Mall and Fashion Show. Now, local Summerlin residents can have a convenient location to shop. n nThats where the good ends. From the moment I entered off of Sahara and drove through the winding passage to get to parking I noted both the lack of signage and the minimal exit pathways making it a nightmare during crowded hours to get in and out safely and quickly. Granted, after a few more weeks the crowd will be smaller but still, it stinks of bad planning. n nNext, there was absolutely no way to know where anything is from the Parking area with the exception of Dillards. In fact, had I not read up on the place, I would never of known it was anything more than a strip mall with Dillards as the centerpiece. n nWhen you finally do wend your way around to the outdoor mall it is notable that the main section of the mall is utterly boring and devoid of interesting decor. There is a section near Crave which is by a water feature that seems entirely out of place but does make for a nice place to relax. n nThe restaurants and stores which are open are entirely generic, wolfgang puck's has an unimaginative menu, CPK and Capriottis are available all over town, CRAVE has potential and I will try it soon but beyond that it has nothing to distinguish itself from any other mall. n nThe REGAL theaters have the reclining seats but there are only 5 theaters so finding the show you want will be hit or miss. n nThere are several other establishments set to open in the next few months and entertainment oriented ROC Resto and Fashion could make things interesting. I will definitely update the review then.",1
"I went here twice. Both times the service sucked! Recently when I was here, i ordered the tofu stew soondubu pork and the seafood vegetable pancake. For some reason, my tofu stew wasn't bubbling hot at all and it didn't reach the rim of the clay pot! Another disappointment was that I could hardly see any pork in my stew. I pointed it out to the waitress ""I ordered pork soondubu, but.where is the pork? She watched me as I swirl my spoon in the stew, a little embarrassed shocked and didn't know how to respond, she walked away! The tofu wasn't the softest more firm. The broth was ok, it could be more flavorful maybe lacking salt or anchovie flavorings? In addition, i have tasted better seafood vegetable pancake. The pancake here wasn't entirely crispy. It was a bit soggy. It was hardly touched. n nI went here twice for soondubu and both times it disappointed me. I've also tried the soondubo over at Mr. Tofu which is a few restaurants down and i think its better. The tofu in Mr. Tofu's soondubus are noticeably softer. I have yet to find a good soondubu place for this cold winter. But for now, I would settle with Mr. Tofu rather than giving this place another try.",1
"I know there used to be a Pussycat Dolls Lounge in Caesar's Palace the last time I went to Vegas in Summer 2009, but I believe that they closed that location and found a new home inside Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino. This move took place sometimes within the last couple years or so. n nAnyway, I decided to check this place out on a whim during my recent trip to Vegas this summer. There was NO cover charge, so guys and girls get in free! SWEET! Ladies also get a free drink card as well, which was awesome! Sorry, boys. n nThe PCD girls were fabulous and so much fun to watch! I'm a girl, and I was completely mesmerized by their moves! Can you imagine what the guys would be thinking?! hahaha.let's not go there. n nThe music was decent it could be better. The atmosphere was laid back chill, and everyone was really relaxed. The stage was open to all the ladies to come up and shake what their momma gave 'em. And at multiple times during the night, one of the PCD girls would go on stage and call more girls to come up for a free shot, which she fed to us. I thought it was nasty vodka or something of the like, but I was greatly surprised to find out it was a mixed concoction that tasted absolutely sweet and delicious! n nOverall, I had a really good time and my group had a lot of fun! Lots of memories made ",2
"I love tropical smoothie but after going to this location a few times it's just not as good as the one on lv boulevard. One of my usual drinks is the rockin raspberry and it tasted sour and disgusting, I ended up throwing it away. The girl who works there late doesn't seem so enthusiastic to be there either.",1
"We got to the room and the toilet had been used urine in the toilet still , soap and shampoo still in the shower, and coffee still dripped in the pot. Simply unacceptable in my eyes. n nI called and complained and the first manager didn't even compensate me. The second day I called again found the coffee issue and the manager gave me my 10 night upgrade fee back. Come on, that's all you do for your guests after some royal mess ups like the above? n nAs a frequent VEgas traveler from LA, I know I won't be going back to Harrah's with that type of service. Been going to Vegas twice a year for 20 years and this was my first and LAST time at Harrah's.",1

As good as it gets for fast food and you can have it however you like. Breakfast is good also.,2
"Overall rating is 2.5 stars out of 5. n nSo my wife and I decided to go here for breakfast. The service here is a tad bit on the slow side even with very few people in here. n nOk so I forgot the name of the meal I ordered but do remember what the meal contained Eggs, 2 sausage links, hash brown, toast, and 2 pancakes. I can tell you that the food looked better than it actually tasted. I mean the food wasn't nasty but I've had better. n nThe eggs were bland and didn't have any real taste to them, so I had to put some salt on them Not a good idea if you have high blood pressure . The toast was actually good, it was nice and buttery. The 2 sausage links and the hash brown were ok I didn't have any issues with them. Finally the pancakes, although they were pretty sizable and looked very good they really didn't have any real taste just a lot of fluff. n nI think the meal here is plentiful and looks good, so it can satisfy you if you are hungry but I don't think it will satiated toggle taste buds. But they that was breakfast and just one item, maybe their other breakfast or lunch items taste better.",1
"These pies are delicious! The shop is just around the corner from our home, and yet it took us 3 years to drop in for a taste. What a waste of 3 years! We tried the blackberry and pecan pies, and both were amazing. The owner is very sweet. Be sure to knock on the door as she keeps it locked.",2
"Do u like the relaxed caribbean mood? The lazy beachy vibe? Tropical flavors of mango, pineapple, citrusy mixes all blended with daring spices on top seafood or meat? If so, this is a place for you. n nThere are not too many BB around, unfortunately. The two i know in Arizona has closed down and nothing of this sort exists in Southern CA. So we travel for BB in Las Vegas. n nIt is off the strip so it is quiet compared to all the other eateries. You won't have ANY problems finding seats here, even on weekends at peak hours, since most will be at hotel buffets or fancy eateries. This place is wonderful especially if u are short on time and want a great bite b f jetting of from sin city and still make it in time for the airport. n nIt is dark inside but the moment you enter you feel like u are in an island! The lazy fans blowing, the colorful decor, and the reggae beats surrounding you. n nThe food is amazing.from the caesar salad to staple appetizers for us Coconut Shrimp Crab, Shrimp, Mango, Avocado Stack Warm Spinach Dip Island Chips n nMy husband loves the West Indies Ribs and I veer towards poultry and love the Bahamian Grilled Chicken Kabobs. n nDessert time is my favorite and the Bananas Supreme is by far the best I have ever tasted. The banana cake is so warm, and fits so perfectly when combined with hot butterscotch brandy sauce served with ice cream and whip. I am not a fan of nuts but this cake you cannot realy taste all the crunchiness which i don't like. I was so inspired I found a recipe and tried it out. Wonderful! n nOther stand outs include Chocolate Island and Chocolate Pineapple Upside Down make wonderful albeit a bit too sweet for me memories. n nStaff so very friendly, i wonder if they partake in cocktail hours! The mojito is awesome as you can feel the crunch of the mint leafs and lime. You cannot really go wrong with cocktails here. n nDefinitely a must go place for us, at least!",2
"LIVID. They need a ZERO STAR rating. I came in and was polite, when they quoted me a 7 10min waiting time I said no problem and sat patiently and had my money in hand intending to leave a little extra as a tip. nI asked for hash browns with green peppers and mushrooms and explained NO ONIONS due to an allergy to go with a coffee. THEY GAVE ME A BOX FULL OF ONIONS ONLY. NO HASHBROWNS w green peppers. They also gave me a TOGO coffee cup with creamer and sugar filled with cold dark Pepsi. AND A BILL hoping I would pay without checking my order before leaving. They rushed me to pay and when I stopped to check my order they literally ran screaming ""Oh no she's checking her food! ""! DISGUSTED. n nMy stomach just growled in pure agony at the idea of slop they packaged as some sick joke on my limited time to head to business. and it's hours later. Treatment like this should not be tolerated and BELIEVE I won't be shy in protecting others from such a unwarranted, spiteful, cruel and unethical experience. I'm keeping the box in the freezer should ANYONE at this establishment take a moment to review the poor experiences mentioned thus far about this particular location on Green Valley. I've seen ZERO responses to other patrons to date which paints a pretty clear picture as to just how this type of behavior continues. n nThis is not a personal opinion, a food critique,. This is a HUGE slap in the face to a local with a big heart for supporting her community, but a bigger mouth when it comes to cruelty. Not letting this one rest. n nThe phone has rang approximately 20x for me to call in what happened . No answer. They picked up somewhere between ring 20 30. informed me the manager was gone for the day, not coming in tomorrow, doesn't have an email and to call back another time. After putting in way too much out of character work I received the contact name of CHENCHO and hope he will be just as appalled by the behavior as I was am.",1
"The flight from Las Vegas to Orange County sucked on St. Patty's Day! This company is shady and wanted to keep on the down low that alcoholic beverages are free on New Years Day, Valentines Day and St. Patrick's Day. They were still announcing beverages cost 5 even though it says it on the brochure on the seat in front of you. When we showed it to the flight attendant she agreed to it but still wanted to keep it quiet. Same thing on our Reno to Vegas flight. We didn't order anything on that one but they were announcing 5 and taking people's money. If you don't want to give out free drinks ever then don't have it in writing! So then on the Vegas flight we didn't end up getting anything anyway because they said it was too turbulent for service after they took everyone's orders. There was hardly any turbulence after they announced it though so that was really lame! They also had no wifi available. They apologized but did not offer anything to make it up to anyone. Such a shady cheap company and this was an expensive little flight!",1
"Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week 30 three course menu app, entree, and dessert and a glass of house wine cabernet or pinot grigio , or draft. I decided to try the Goat cheese stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger comes with Salut fries , and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger. n nI've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before at Fez , so I knew these would be tasty. The peppers were raw as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway , so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild tasting vegetable oil. http www.yelp.com biz photos salut kitchen bar tempe?select H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q I ate two of the four peppadews to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert. . n nI ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes allergies , and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium ""red in the center "" , but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all. However, it was still juicy and tender. The bun was good looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery. Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet. No matter I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.

"WE enjoyed our lunch. WE had a Beet salad and chicken salad sandwich. Food was fresh and the salad was great. Wish there would have been a but more goat cheese on the salad. IT was so creamy and good. Prices were a but steep for what you get, but my guess it is all because of Gordon's name. I love him so I will be back. ",2
"I have never been so disappointed with an olive garden before. So I arrive in the parking lot and the outside looks like your typical Olive Garden. Walk in side and it is very open and very rustic looking a plus the chairs are on wheels which I'm not used to but was kind of cool. As usual the wait staff is very friendly and polite. I ordered the bottomless pasta bowl I first had the three cheese marinara with penne pasta and Italian sausage. the sauce was almost non existent and I had to slice the sausage myself and the penne pasta was mushy but I decided to try something else so I got the Alfredo with penne and meatballs. The Alfredo was tasteless surprising because Alfredo is usually always good the penne that time was good but they forgot to salt it during the boiling part. The breadstick were delicious because it is pre made all the have to do is bake it. The chicken gnocchi soup taste good as soon as it cooled and the lasagna fritta didn't taste good till it was coeld. I feel sorry for the waiter cause he could tell that I was not happy, because of him I give it two stars.",1

We have purchased every over the counter and professional tick killer known to man and we still occasionally pick one off the dog.a few days after visiting the park we woke up to about 150 of the little beasties all over the house, even one on my son's neck.

"FnB is a wonderful treat vegetables prepared beautifully and uniquely, impeccable service, and a general sense of wellness that accompanies a meal that doesn't miss a beat. Pavle treats everyone as if they're family and walked us through a tour of the lagos, skirt steak, roasted potatoes, and so much more. n nThe lagos was a wonderful turkish inspired bread dish served with enormous orbs of roasted elephant garlic, which we spread ""like butter "", served with a nice cream sauce. It was fantastic. n nThe skirt steak was perfectly prepared and served over an interesting cold salsa of roasted corn and apricot and some other goodies, with a chimichurri sauce on top. Spot on, and an interesting blend of textures and flavors. n nAnd the potatoes. I did not know you could do such things to potatoes. Roasted and charred perfectly, with a nearly spongy crunch to them, served with delicious melted cheese and an egg on top. n nThe menu rotates pretty frequently so I won't go into too much detail of the several other dishes we had but I'll say they were all pitch perfect, up to the amazing butterscotch pudding we had for dessert. n nThis is one of those special meals that will warm you over as you get to try new approaches to interesting ingredients. Each step is exciting and different and tastes fantastic. I'm not a wine drinker, so I can't comment on the Arizona only wine selection, but I've heard good things and with everything else being so spot on, I'd be surprised if it were to be found a shortcoming. n nI plan on coming back in the next quarter when the menu shifts up again, but that's only because I'm trying my hardest not to come back immediately and do it all again.",2
The food is just ok nothing special. I had the fish and chips I would rather them be battered and not Panko crusted. The service is just ok too. I did enjoy the cold beer.,1
"I really needed carpet and I was impressed with a carpet promotional card that came in the mail for RC Willey. 39 installation and 15 20 off all Stainmaster carpets. I thought I hit a lucky strike. n nI called to schedule a measurement of my home. The guy was nice enough and ensured me this twice a year offer was one RC Willey actually looses money on. He explained they try to boost sales even if there is virtually no mark up. Okay, I thought. Seems somewhat logical.I guess. n nSo I go in to RC Willey and meet a sales rep. She has me look at tons of samples and has me pick like 10. After 30 mins of this, I ask if these are the promotional Stainmaster carpets. She assures me everything is on sale. Im suspicious but I play along. n nFinally I have her quote me for one sample I liked. Mind you its 3 bedrooms and less than 600 total sq feet. The price 3300. Like as in 1100 per average size 10x10 bedroom I ask, and she says ""yes' with a straight face. So I ask what is really on a good sale like as described in the flyer? She explains the samples with a black dot is what is on special like why didn't she say this at first? . So out of 1000's of samples like 12 have the black dot if you can find them . n nOf course the samples on sale are the ugliest. Drab grays and browns and cheap materials. One was dark burgundy with rose pattens, I kid you not. n nI am annoyed and ask for a quote for the least of the ugly cheap sample I can find. Price 1700. Plus I will have to move all my own furniture. I call around to multiple carpet dealers in town there are tons and get quotes for hundreds of dollars less, some almost half of these prices. n nLong story short, RC Willey uses gimmicks and the old bait and switch to get people in the store. A total waste of everyone's time. n nNever again",1
"I've been to Halftime 5 times since it's opening last year. The food is very plain and distasteful. Granted that they have the typical barroom food, but it's just not good. I've had better from the frozen food isle. The service is slow. The people are rude and a little haughty. Let's face it, this is Buckeye. There's is and never will be a reason to be haughty. n nWon't return and tell everyone we know that it's an undesirable place to be. It's worth the drive to go a little farther to the Longhorn for a truly delicious burger and friendly, efficient service.",1
"I got here at 4pm today where there wasn't that many people there, which was awesome considering I had a cranky toddler that kept throwing his bottle and crayons. n nThe food was awesome and my son had the mac and cheese. It wasn't the regular Kraft mac and cheese which I appreciated if I wanted him to eat that I would have got the box for 1 at the store and made it myself . n nService was great, the only dislike was the okra. a bit too breaded and was more of a crouton than a breaded vegetable. n nWill be back again ",2
"Service wasn't the great, burger was dry, fries were extremely greasy. Toppings are confusing the kitchen gives you the lettuce and tomato the mayo, onions and pickles are at a condiment bar and the ketchup mustard is on your table. Didn't make much sense. Overall wasn't worth the money, Smash Burger is a better choice. I do have to say though the restaurant smelt really good that camping aroma of burning wood and charred beef. I loved that.",1

"What a gem! n nCapping off a recent stay at the ""M "" Resort, we were going to drive back into the strip, probably 5 miles , and try out another potentially interesting eatery, but alas, it was already 8 45 p.m. and our energy level was running on empty. Hence, we opted to remain at the ""M "" and try out its local cuisine, and we're so glad we did. nWe made arrangements to dine at ""Terzetto "", which boasts a wonderful oyster bar, and an interior design worthy of the cover of ""Architectural Digest "". I wish we could post photos with this review . n nWe began with a shared appetizer salad of a tomato mozzarella caprese with spring greens and a light vinaigrette. Very tasty. nMy friend ordered a rare 12 oz prime rib , with a side of fresh sauteed brocolinni, prepared deftly and perfectly, very nice. My entree was a combination 8 oz fillet mignon rare and 8 oz lobster tail served with drawn lemon butter. Both accompanied by a side of cubed butternut squash gratinee. All three offerings were prepared impeccably and tasted magnificently. n nSome beautiful deserts were presented to us, but alas, we were stuffed to the gills, no more room. nThe meal was served with a buttery complex house chardonnay, which was quite acceptable. The french bread offered at the onset was one of the best I've ever tasted. n n All beef served at Terzetto is raised on the owner's cattle ranch in Montana, and the quality was superb. n nI strongly recommend Terzetto to everyone. It is a comfortable and beautiful restaurant, with excellently prepared food. Please enjoy!",2
"You will not be disappointed! While we typically eat at the bar instead of the dining room, we have always received top notch, professional service. Cocktails are shaken and stirred up one at a time right in front of you which is excellent. The steaks are to die for, the Happy Hour menu rocks, and to top it all off the creme brulee here has become my absolute favorite dessert in the world. Be prepared to drop some but in my opinion this place is nearly as good as it can get.",2
"After I went to Little Miss BBQ, I decided that I needed some ice cream. I had this bookmarked and decided to have some dessert. It was bomb! n nI walked in and looked over the menu real quick. It was a tough choice between the ""Smores Sundae "" or the ""Rocky Road Lil Freezie "". While I was looking at the menu, the voice of Sloth in The Goonies popped into my head. ""Rocky Roooooaadddd "". That was it. I ordered a Rocky Road Lil Freezie. This creation came with 2 possibly more scoops of ice cream, it was stuffed full of chocolate covered almonds and then topped with some marshmallow fluff. They constructed my ice cream and then at the very last minute they bust out the blow torch to toast my marshmallow. They handed over the goods and here is how it was. n nRocky Road Lil Freezie This thing was great! They give you a huge scoop of marshmallow and then toast it for you. This is placed upon 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream and then its mixed in with chocolate covered almonds. The almonds were almost like an almond bark. They were really delicious! They blend it up like a concrete blizzard and then hand it over. n nI will come back the next time I am allowed to eat ice cream and try out some of their other stuff. It's not cheap.almost 7.00 for my concoction but it was very refreshing and one hell of an ice cream treat.",2
"Do not go to the restaurant right now. The hotel is under construction and you will be dining in an auxiliary room, which has as much charm as a coat room.

However.I prefer legume. n nWe started the dinner with 2 appetizers n Spare ribs with BBQ sauce n Smoked tuna strawberry salad n nBoth were delicious. The spare ribs were meat falling off the bone tender and the sauce was bbq sauce but more refined. The smoked tuna on the salad made the appetizer worth it. n nFor my main course n arctic char and scallops with couscous n nThe arctic char was nothing special but the scallops were AMAZING, unquestionably FRESH. Best part of the meal hands down too bad there were only 2 pieces . A friend had the ribeye which was also very tasty. n nI definitely enjoyed my meal at avenue b, but with a meal that comes at a hefty price, I don't know if it's worth another trip If I'm paying that much, the food BETTER be mind blowing.",2
Del Rey in Mesa and Gilbert are extremely helpful and do a great job. They are friendly and courteous. I am a costumer and bring in hundreds of garments at a time and they don't bat an eye.

The large pizza is huge! They make it fresh with fresh ingredients. The service was outstanding and friendly. One thing I noticed was the owner was there and he knew the names of all his customers. They have a lot of repeat customers which is makes you feel at home in this place. I love it and you will too.",2
"During my most recent trip, our group decided to stay at the Vdara after finding an amazing deal for an Executive Corner Suite. Since it's one of the newest hotels in Vegas, I expected pretty high class accommodations, which is what we ended up getting. However, that doesn't come without some shortfalls. n nPros n n The rooms are wonderfully decorated with the most modern furniture. The bathroom is HUGE and features a shower big enough to fit 3 4 people for a post pool drunk shower swimsuit on of course . The suite comes with a fridge, sink, and all your very basic kitchen amenities. n n Window blinds come down with a push of a button, which is also a very cool thing to see in such a large suite. n n The Execute Corner Suite comes with a bed big enough to fit 4 girls or 3 guys, as well as a foldout couch that can fit the same amount, just not as comfortably. These guys know we don't come to Vegas in small groups. n n 2 Plasma TVs, one of which is connected to the sound system that features a music hookup. Being able to play music in your room is a highly beneficial tool when you have 10 people drunk in the middle of the day. n n The pool is nice and quiet compared to the other big hotels. It's basic and good to go to if you're just looking to get away and not deal with the crowds. However, beware of the Vdara reflecting ray. You don't want to come back from Vegas looking like a lobster. n n Although the valet can take forever on a busy Sunday, the employees really work their ass off to get your car as soon as possible. You see them constantly running, which can't be an easy job to do for 8 hours a day. Hats off to them. n nCons n n Even though the suite is modern, it's a bit cramped. I've stayed in similar suites elsewhere with more people, and there was much more walking space. Yes this, suite wasn't intended for a group of 10, but there are some areas of it that make you feel cramped even when it's empty. n n There's no self parking. You either valet or park at the Cosmopolitan. Since most Vegas hotels have self parking, this became very confusing for us and we ended up going with the latter option. We only realized this by the next day, which brings me to my next point n n If you self park at the Cosmopolitan, it takes forever to find the Vdara on your first try. There's no signs or directions. You eventually have to walk to the curb outside and then take the stairs elevator up to the Vdara. This can be extremely frustrating for first timers. Does it hurt to build a walkway between Cosmo and Vdara? n n Room key checkers at the elevators are useless as always. Anyone without a key can easily slip in with a group and go in unnoticed. This security tactic never works. n nOverall, I had a fantastic stay at one of Vegas' newest and most modern hotels, once I figured out how to get to it.",2
"Came here after watching a show, and the fact that dela hoya came here was a little inspiring too. The ambiance is pretty nice, very red, nice tables, fountain inside very modern and slick. Once again, the hostess was nice, but the waiter was a robot. No personality, just got the job done. n nI ordered the cochinita i think it's called . It's basically a huge chunk of pork on the bone, cooked in banana leaves. it was really tasty and fall off the bone tender. But obviously, this was a guy kinda dish, since there was barely anything else on the plate. A few grains of rice, and a veggie or 2 that's it! it was basically just a big chunk of meat. nHubs ordered the pork tacos, which just looked way better than what I got. it came with all the fixin's and tortillas on the side. I'll admit, I was jealous! And of course I helped him eat some of it. The pork he got was super bland, though. Maybe cause he got more sides to make up for the lack of flavor.? n nOverall, after being wow'ed by the pretty decor, I wasn't too impressed with the food. They served chips with salsa and flavored salt which I kept eating all night. The green lime salt was my favorite. I don't know if we'd come back there are so many other restaurants just across the walkway that I'd rather try.",1
"I just came back from staying at the MGM signature. This was during the weekend of the EDC, so I'm hoping it's not always like this. This pool is gross, no that word doesn't even come close to it. I was there when it first open on Monday afternoon, then went back up to my room that overlooked all pools at MGM and the water was actually brownish gray, all other pools were sparkling blue. I hope the pool was drained for the next day, I wasn't going to chance it though. Man eating bacteria anyone?",1
"I recently stayed at the Luxor while in Las Vegas for a convention at the Mandalay Bay. I stayed in the East Tower not the pyramid and found the layout to be a bit disorganized to get from the lobby to your room and from your room back out to the strip or other hotels. It's not a big deal, but you can certainly tell that the towers were an afterthought and not very well planned. The in room non wireless internet was nearly unusable which seems a bit poor in 2011! The room itself was clean and well maintained. The staff were pleasant. I would recommend that if you're looking for something other than a cheap place to sleep you find another hotel. If in room internet access is important certainly find somewhere else to stay.",1
"I would not necessarily recommend eating sushi here. There was way too much fish and it made us uncomfortable for the price. I like high quality sushi and when eating raw fish, I don't think this is negotiable. This is not high quality. It's high quantity. I was pretty disappointed. Service and ambiance also left much to be desired. n nAlso, the menu was very confusing. The descriptions have no prices.

""GREAT "" fried mushrooms. .the dipping sause was nice and thick, love that. you order at the counter and the server brings it to you, nice and easy . comfortable little place.the drinks are huge.summertime delight. also the AC was ON HIGH .YES! nWonder whats for breakfast? I will be ready!",2
"Very disappointed. Had a deadline and paid almost three weeks in advance. The ""graphic artist "" never discussed my idea with me . He waited over a week to contact me and get me a proof . He NEVER personally talked to me until I drove over to the shop. I had to relay messages thru another employee because the artist wouldn't communicate. He was lazy and drew like a kindergartner. The lines of his work didn't even match up, I actually went into the print shop to try and work things out but only ended up more frustrated. The manager or whatever , Ralph , wrote me a nice long email about how much he cared and took pride in the work that they did. So , I fell for it as I thought he was going to be accountable and help get the job done. But no , he thru me right back to Travis who was completely clueless. I was so frustrated because there were only two days before our big event . We are a non profit and have funders coming to see the work we are doing and we wanted a nice banner to help show that we are using their brand. Its not like we were asking for anything extraordinary. I have never in the 12 years I've been communicating to print shops had this problem. We are in housing its not that difficult . I have even used freelance artists from other counties whom I've only communicated thru email and NEVER had an issue . Well, anyway , we were in an emergency and needed to get this done and Travis was useless. Ralph then disappeared and didn't address the other emails we sent after his nice email about how much he wanted to help us. I hired an outside artist and paid even more money for a rush job. We would have never had to be put in this situation if Ralph had done what he promised and taken a more proactive role as he had promised . He then became condescending and acted like a bully. We asked for a refund for the graphic design and he said he never charged one. We sent a copy of the invoice showing a 65 dollar charge and he got mad because we called him out. The accountant did refund it. Bottom line, we had to get stressed out over getting the banner done in time. We had to prepay , because of the rush there are mistakes on the banner. Basically we are the proud owners of a 400 banner we will never use. I would never do business again with these people. Travis is immature and has terrible work ethic. And Ralph pretends like he cares but in the end he will tell you to pound sand. Too bad this local business is not worth wasting your time or money. I feel like they are a day late and a dollar short printing. Terrible customer service , communication and work ethic, follow thru.",1
"Brand new location, really nice, great service, great food, chicken nuggets are my fav!",2
"1 star why? The food wasn't too bad. My husband had the fish tacos which were good. I ordered the Sicilian Stuffed Chicken, but get this. it's not even stuffed. I had food envy. n nAnyway, the waitress was super busy and I had to wave her down everytime I needed something. We went there tonight after Costco. Kid's eat free on Sundays. I've never even been there, so I didn't know. The waitress ""forgot "" to take the kid's meals off. It's advertised on the colorable menus. Then when I gave her my Groupon, she said she couldn't accept it. Now mind you, we ordered a couple of rounds of alcoholic drinks, so our bill wasn't low. And no where on the Groupon did it say that it couldn't be used with a special. A Groupon would normally state that. n nAfter I am ""allowed "" to use my Groupon, I won't go back there again. We go out several times a week out to eat, and I'd rather spend my money somewhere else. The food was decent, but I definitely wouldn't rave about it. The waitress took almost 20 minutes to get our bill situated. My husband was annoyed that we were waiting for so long. The owner, who was very nice, had to close out our check and bring us a box. We never even saw the waitress again. Way to go! n nOh, and it was the same temperature inside as it was outside. I guess they're really doing that bad and can't turn on the air conditioner. My 2 year old was sweating for the first time.",1
"Visit 1 n nTo be fair, so far this review is only for the buffet. which was god awful. I can't see how anyone could rate this as quality food, even those that don't really know authentic Thai food. In an attempt to be fair though, I will return one day and try their main course dishes. I've not heard good things about Lotus from friends of mine that know real Thai food. I'll reserve my own judgment for a time when I can try something other than the horrible buffet they have during lunch.",1
"Very Good but not great unfortunately. I had the full course tasting menu and was mainly impressed with the dessert offerings. Being not much of a dessert guy, this was a letdown since I had such a high expectation. The other dishes are not as memorable for me.",2

"I encountered a situation where the elderly couple we were eating with shared a few pieces of shrimp after one of them ordered the steak and unlimited shrimp option. OK that was our bad, we told them that they couldn't do that and they stopped. We ordered another round of shrimp and the manager decided to come over to our table and instead of politely notifying us that there is no sharing, it seemed like she wanted to announce it to the other tables around us and remind us that it says that on the menu. We offered to pay for a side of shrimp if it was an issue, but the manager just said it was OK and walked away. The conversation between the manager and the elderly man after that was not professional and was indicative of someone who did not have enough training to diffuse a guest situation. n nSide note if you and any other party members order their all you can eat shrimp option you still can't share. I made sure to clearly ask the server this question to be sure there was no misunderstanding. n nThis rating is not because of the ""no sharing "" rule, I now take issue with the Outback Steakhouse slogan. The food was decent, but the situation should have been handled better. I have had ample customer and guest service training to know that much. I believe more training is necessary for both management and staff. n nThe experience was bad enough to negate anything positive about the food. I will not be returning and cannot recommend this establishment to anyone.",1

"Oh my gosh, this is freaking delicious. Their truffle chips were mouthwatering and the Pig Mac was so good I had to toss the final corner of the sandwich out the car window or I was going to eat it all give myself a stomach ache.

"Fantastic meal. Fantastic experience. n nI am a vegetarian. I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation, starting with sourcing. I don't just patronize Farmers Markets, I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Markets.that sort of thing. Long story short, if I am going to dine out, I want something very special. VERY special. n nQuiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn. I dined there with my son and daughter in law.both truly expert cooks.more knowledgeable than I. n nAll of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal. We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine. I got the vegetarian.they got the carnivore or ominvore or whatever they call it! . Truthfully, labels are irrelevant. It's all in the taste.and the tastes are sublime! n nI was impressed by how much variety was in each plate. Theirs were similar but each a little different. More importantly, there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors. n nThe most impressive thing The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations . That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable. n nThe setting is beautiful. The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well. n nOur only criticism and it is minor is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted, we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability. There is so much wonderful local fruit used in other courses, I might add! .perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely.I'm sure the chefs' creativity can conjure more ideas than I! n nThat said, I will return!

"It was one of those unanticipated nights, where a coming together of long unseen friends and everyday acquaintances coalesces into something magical. It was supposed to be a mens night for the men and a ladies night for the ladies, but before we could go our separate ways the men realized they loved the ladies and the ladies too loved their men and so all together we decided not to deny ourselves the company of the other sex. Unanimously, we wanted Cajun Queen. nWe were all already lit up from our daylight binging, so by the time we stumbled in we were ready for a good time. A milk skinned hostess in a golf green blazer and a white and peach paisley blouse batted at us with hazel eyes beneath a mop of perfectly tussled and pasted curls. ""We have eight, "" I said. She glowered. Before she could reply, I little white lied her ""We called ahead. they told us to come right now. "" nGreen blazer took off to see what she could manage we loitered in the foyer, teetering drunk, glazed eyes reeling under the light of the antique chandelier. Green blazer came back and told us it'd be a bit of wait and recommended we hit the upstairs bar. We were already halfway up the steps. nCajun Queen is one of those big old Elizabeth houses, southern gothic, eclectically arranged and echoing blindly with voices from some other era. It's a chatterbox of ancient heritage and white hot with flickering, inconsistent lights that make you want to trim your mustache pencil thin and drink only from a snifter. Aroma suffused our consciousness and we all just became mindless, visceral things. nAt the upstairs bar, this long swan of a bartendress was commanding the room, elegantly and fluidly fetching glasses from the overhead rack, snatching mixers from the under counter cooler, upturning bottles and dispensing drafts, all motions in succession, all so swift and natural, like something perfectly choreographed and rehearsed. She doled out a trayful of Olde Meck Coppers and we set ourselves to achieving the night. nWe were led to a corner table near the glassed wall of the little balcony at the back. I took a chair at the end, sat, leaned back, and rapped my knuckles against the abrasive texture of the mud red stucco. Our very knowledgeable, upright waiter prattled off a series of specials and toppings of the day with juicy detail, but I all heard was 'something unbelievably amazing' followed by 'something else equally amazing'. I requested a couple batches of fried oysters for the table, and then we went in rounds, ordering our blackened catfishes and our crawfish etouffees and our obscene platters of shrimp and fish and sausage and delight. nWithout needing to ask, our upright waiter returned with another round of beers and a handful of waters. ""Good man, "" I said with an acknowledging nod. Huxley was sitting at the opposite end of the table. We had subconsciously retained the man woman divide throughout the evening. I looked her way until she felt my gaze and when she glanced back I shot her a clever wink. She smiled. I swooned. nOur food arrived and we all collectively lost our minds. Remoulade dipped oysters, creamy clumps of spicy rice, mouth searing fish and peppery shrimp, beer and wine, more wine, and life and love and faces flush and hearts racing. We ate ourselves full, but couldn't stop. Flavors were assaulting us in such unmitigable ways, we were powerless to refuse their beckoning call of mouth flaming, heart swelling, eye watering release. Ryan, at one point, shoved his seat back, sat up straight with hands on thighs, neck rigid like a scout dog, let out a billowing exhale, momentarily composed himself, then jumped back in for another oyster and few more forkfuls of rice. nAt the table behind us, a prim blond let out a squelch of a cry, half stood, leaned forward, grabbed her man behind his fuzzy dark ears, and kissed him hard on the mouth. She held that embrace for some time, and all the lights and sounds in the room imploded in upon them. When her lips broke free from his, all the noise and clarity rushed back upon us in a crash. She sat down and knuckled a tear from her eye. n I clapped my hands and beamed across the room. ""This is the greatest night ever! "" I shouted out to the dining area. nKathryn, a steadying force in our group, narrowed one eye and nodded at me placatively. ""You really enjoy the hyperbole, don't you? "" n ""Get up for it, Kathryn! "" I threw my hands wildly about in the air above me. ""If it isn't the greatest night. then tell yourself it is, believe it, and make everyone else believe it too! Then it really will be! "" nThe prim blond and her man giggled, and a few tables around us applauded. I ceremoniously forked the last fried oyster from our appetizer tray, held it high like a chalice, like a triumph, angled my neck, opened my jaw wide, and brought it down mightily into my mouth. nKathryn looked around, a touch embarrassed, and then began furiously laughing. ""Oh, I believe it, "" she said. ""I believe it. """,2

"This is a cattle call. This is a surgery center for several eye docs in the west valley. There are 3 OR's. My father in law was told to arrive at 1 PM, and his procedure would be at 2 30. We arrive slightly early, and sign in. We wait. and continue to wait. nFinally, at 3 30 they begin his paperwork and then he waits some more. Finally, they take him back. and we wait. At 4 45 the tech comes out to tell us we assume he is finally done that he is NEXT. She states the doc is finishing up the procedure and he would be in next. FInally at 5 00 PM another tech comes and tells us that he just went in. We have been there for 4 hrs and this is the only updates that we have received from them. And when we dare to ask why, the attitude starts as if we should just sit and be quiet. Now. there are others in the waiting room, and they are waiting for a patient by a different doc, but we ask, how long have you been here? Same story. Another man, also waiting, same story. This place heards the patients in, and just let them wait. They are preying on the elderly, knowing that they will just sit and wait. Simply outragous and if I am ever asked to refer anyone to this facility, I certainly would not. n n As a side note, the reason I am so upset is that I have worked in opthalmolgy before, and know that this IS standard practice to run late because of overbooking, HOWEVER, we also called patients and told them to come in later rather than having them sit in the lobby for hours. Let the patient make an informed decision. Not to mention the family members that take time off of work,to take them, and they too are left waiting for hours on end.",1

"The only reason they got a star is because the food was good. My family wanted bagels this rainy morning so I jumped in my car knowing that Einstein's had a drive through. yay! After a VERY long drive through wait which I didn't even mind I received my order. On my way home I was smart enough to check my order was going to do it at the window but seeing that their was tons of cars behind me I put faith in the Einstein workers. big mistake . They completely forgot over half of my cream cheese. Little irritated and pregnant . which never helps! I called the store as I turned back around half way home and asked that they put together my cream cheese and run it out to me considering there was a reason I was going through the drive through raining. PJ's. pregnant. The man on their side said no problem. Then I called back when I got there and a female worker answered. I mentioned what I discussed with the previous worker and she was dead silent for a good 30 seconds hello. anyone there? and seemed extremely annoyed that I wanted her to run them out to me mind you its sprinkling now at best and Im pulled in right up front . Frankly, I was annoyed that them running it out to me was MY idea and not their immediate suggestion in the first place worked many years in retail customer service and even food service . THEN. arg . I get home. and come to find that my chocolate chip bagels were actually cinnamon raisin. . . . Did I mention I was pregnant?! There was no way I was going back AGAIN to get a freakin chocolate chip bagel. nLESSON LEARNED If you go to this establishment forget about good faith. always check your order thoroughly before leaving the drive through. even if there is a mile length of cars behind you who have been waiting a very long time.",1

"If I lived in Vegas, I'd probably be 50 lbs. overweight with all the buffets and cheap but good eats everywhere in this desert town. n nBy the power of Yelp, we found something off the beaten path that only the locals know about and a few tourists willing to venture out here. It's located just off The Strip, but pretty far enough to get away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. n nThis is old school Vegas at its finest. n nThe cafe is located on the corner of this casino with old, dark, rustic wood panels that reminds you of those classic movies from the 50's and 60's. It's definitely uniquely charming in it's own way. She ain't pretty, in fact she's pretty ugly.but beautiful nonetheless. n nVegas is known for many things, and Steak Eggs is certainly one of them. Wifey and I were looking for a late night place to grab some grub and this place lit up as bright as all of Vegas' neon signs combined. n nHow could you go wrong with a 5.99 Steak Eggs special? You simply can't. This is unlike those 5.99 Steak Eggs specials from Denny's, IHOP's and Reno. It doesn't even come close. n nSo the special runs from 11 00 PM to 07 00 AM. It's perfect for a town that doesn't sleep. They also make their own brew. n nThe one thing I was not expecting from a joint like this was exceptional service. The place is not a dump, it ain't first class either and certainly not a place where one would expect great service. Our server, Rosie, was superb. Loved everything about her, especially her English accent. n nBesides their 5.99 Steak Eggs special, she recommended the Prime Rib 13.99 as they only had a few cuts left and we better get them before they are 86'd. Wifey and I decided to share, and Rosie said that it comes with a 20 oz. beer. n nSOLD! n nI ordered the 10 oz. Steak Eggs 9.99 while Wifey ordered the special, and the Prime Rib with a side of salad. Rosie threw in the soup of the day for good measure. This place did not disappoint one bit as the steaks were cooked to perfection with all the tenderness and juiciness one would expect from a medium rare steak. But I was in for another surprise as I cut a piece of the Prime Rib and the flavor just hit me like Manny Pacquiao's left hook. Rosie was right. n nHad we had more time in this town, we surely would have returned for an encore performance. But alas, that would have to wait until we're in Vegas again.",2

"I was impressed with First Friday because I feel it brings culture and community to Las Vegas. I lived in Vegas for 11 years and really appreciate what is growing in Downtown. I appreciate the art booths as well as the boutique antique shops. I even watched a free yoga class that was going on and was tempted to participate except I was still with drink in hand. I ran into a lot of friends from the hotel and nightlife industry who had even brought their kids. There were many strollers to navigate through and it was satisfying to see families participate in this event. n I agree with some other reviews I have read on here, there are a lot of teens and crowds. I don't think they were a disturbance, aside from groups of them clustered together. I actually enjoyed watching a dance circle form where teens and an adorable 7year old, began break dancing and pop locking. It's nice to see that teens have somewhere to hang out that IS part of the community and exposes them to culture in this city. I went to high school in Vegas and I know the lack of ""under 21 "" activities this city does not provide, so for me it is great that there is an event like this. n My advice to anyone with kids that is worried about the teenage crowds is to just go earlier and leave around 8 30 or 9pm. But, with all honesty, I never felt uncomfortable and in the least bit ""not safe. "" n Bottom line, this was a good time and I will continue to support the local artists, retailers and sense of Vegas Community that First Friday creates. nCheers!",2

"Dropped by here after spending some time at it's sister property, Wild Horse Pass. This place is smaller, but it was jam packed!

"I went here for the first time last Friday and had a lot of fun. The bartender that helped me, though he was a Jets fan, was super friendly and remembered my order everytime I went back to get more drinks. The drinks were pretty cheap. I also ordered some tacos that were really good. They have a ton of televisions and a small dance floor, as well as a couple pool tables, a beer pong table, and a cornhole set. It was busy but I was able to move around and enjoy myself. I'd definitely come back here to grab a drink and play some pool or hang out.",2
"Terrible! This ""restaurant "" is in a great location, right in our neighborhood. This may be a convenient place to get your meal, but you will regret it. The food was not edible. This was probably the owners first restaurant, after looking at the poorly written menu. They didn't even have guacamole on the menu. If i am right and this was her first restaurant, why would she begin by creating a mexican restaurant? You know it is not going to be authentic. We ordered some disgusting chicken tacos with a weird spicy barbeque like sauce and we also ordered some empenadas. These empenadas tasted like the frozen ones which you defrost, which she probably did happen! Overall, the only good part of the meal was the chips not the salsa , and the chips were just like Tostitos. nAnother really unprofessional way of beginning a new business is leaving the restaurant! As we were leaving to go to our car, the owner walked to the nearby boutique to go shopping. I do not think it is OK for the owner to leave the restaurant to do some shopping. nI think if you live in that part of town like I di, you are better off eating at a GOOD restaurant after the 101. The Summit tried, but failed.",1

I feel like the Venetian should have several different yelp pages because there is so much to talk about! n nLOVE the rooms. they are all suites so it's super spacious and I really like how you don't have to sit on your bed to eat or hang out because there is like a living room in each suite. n nBathrooms are huge and there are tons of mirrors everywhere so it's the perfect place to stay if you have a group of girls. n nAnother plus is the location! Lots of restaurant food choices downstairs. obviously tao and tao beach are located in the hotel too. n noh no ipod dock.wtf?!? so make sure you bring one!,2

As you go a bit further you get into some fun and funky jewelry and then clothing. In the other room they have their baby section in the front and then their vintage clothing in the back. The vintage stuff seems to be of 2 minds Cocktail house dresses for women, cowboy styled shirts for guys. And some T shirts w funny sayings logos that are older, but not necessarily ""vintage "". n nAs much as I love vintage stuff this wasn't the best collection. Fun to look at, but nothing super special. I think the area where I'll do most of my purchasing is her selection of fun and funky magnets and cool Japanese pop culture magnets key chains doo dads. Totally perfect for fun little gifts for folks who say ""don't get me anything "" or already have everything. And their fun soda section was cool. Right next to their Moxie cola they had Dr. Pepper in a glass bottle which I hadn't seen before. n nGreat place to shop for yourself or friends. Just about any friends really. Very cute and comfortable place to shop and look. I'm sure her grandmother is proud.",2
"I booked a round trip ticket on line. My experience heading from the airport was fine. Check in was smooth, and I only sat on the shuttle for 10 minutes before we departed. My hotel was the first stop. No problems. My return trip was not as easy. My paperwork showed I would be picked up at 1005. I was waiting out front of my hotel 15 minutes prior to that. At 1035 I called customer service and was informed that the shuttle normally picked up from my hotel at 45 minutes past the hour. So I assumed I would only have to wait another 10 minutes, right? Wrong. The next shuttle to my hotel would be at 1145. That would not give me enough time to check in for my flight. No apologies, no offer to refund my money. I wound up taking a cab.",1

"I just had a wonderful panini sandwich with a group of friends at Blue Elephant Cafe. It was filled with apple slivers, delicious cheese, fresh greens, and a spicy mustard. The wonderful lunch was topped off with an extraordinarily good cup of coffee. Try out this pretty spot whenever you're in the neighborhood. You'll be glad you did.",2
"Bacon Chocolate Pancakes. If that's not reason enough for you to try Bluprint then we can probably never see eye to eye. n nBluprint is a little hard to find, hiding in the heart of the Carillon building, you've gotta be looking for it or you won't find it. It's a swanky little spot with, appropriately, a white and blue decorating scheme. The bar looked like a comfy place for after work drinks. n nThe menu had some very intriguing options for breakfast. Their red velvet pancakes are their signature dish, I'm told. The nice lady at the table behind me loved them. I had the bacon and chocolate pancakes and they were delicious. n nBluprint has only been open for about 5 weeks apparently, and I heard a couple hiccups in the service for tables nearby, but they seemed to just be growing pains. All the employees I encountered were very nice and eager to please. My server offered me a cup of coffee to go when I paid my bill. A very nice touch. n nOh, and my bill, was only 10!

"This Target feels somewhat old and run down compared to the brand new one close to the Chandler Fashion Center mall. They do have a large garden center that is housed in a separate building so that is nice but really I find that it is usually cheaper to get what you need at Lowes or Home Depot. n nThe last time we were here I did notice that they have the nice, new plastic shopping carts that are so much easier to push. So, that is a plus. Also, there was a sign that they are expanding their grocery section and a portion of the store was under construction so it appears that they will soon have a fully stocked store with fresh produce in addition to the small dry food and dairy frozen cases that they already have.",1

We tried Hunan Park last night and were not disappointed. We live 0.9 miles outside of the delivery radius boo! so pick up it is for us, but it's worth it.",2
"For charged 47 just to have my vehicle inspected, only to be told that to replace the water pump in my car would cost 1200 and require 8 hours of labor. I decided to get a second opinion from a local mechanic who was able to make all the repairs for 604. Never going back to Firestone again.",1
"I already did not like this walmart due to all the rude emplyoees that are always working, but yetserday they crossed the like. My boyfriend went to make a purchase for a basketball had it in a bag, receipt and everything and was practially chased down out the store because the lady thought he had stoled it. With the reciept right in his hand? He has no reason to take anything. The lady behind was very disturbed about the situation she even asked the employee who chased him down if she wanted to see her reciept too. Just shows how racism still goes on. I already dislike this Wal mart, but now I rather drive as far as I have to just not to go to this location.",1
Bonnie did our wedding flowers almost a year ago and it was more than I had expected quality wise. It was less than expected money wise. She was the only shop that guaranteed and made sure I had the light blue hydrangeas that I was crazy about. Cant go wrong with Bonnie!,2
"Great Sunday brunch spot but get here before 11am! n nBreakfast poutine was good but very heavy and rich, croque Monsieur was delicious! Great hash browns and many gluten free options",2
"Overall, our 5 night stay here was pleasant. The room was nice, and because it was my birthday they sent up some macarons. n nThe cons nShortly into our stay we noticed that one of the bathroom sinks wasn't draining properly. We aren't big complainers so we just shrugged and started using the second sink instead. However, by the 2nd or 3rd day, both sinks were clearly clogged and it would take around 30 minutes to drain. My husband would shave, and because it took SO long to drain, the hair would still be there once the water finally drained it was gross, to put it shortly. We decided to talk to the management in the morning to see if we could get upgraded or moved to a different room with properly working sinks . nThey claimed that they couldn't move us to a different rooms because there weren't any available which is interesting because we had just seen a huge line of people checking out, and in addition to that, it was a week day which is when hotels are less busy. nInstead, they offered to send maintenance up and gave us a 50 dining credit. We assumed the sinks would be fixed right away, but it was already late into the afternoon and the maintenance person didn't show up, so we called the front desk again. They fixed it by that evening. nHonestly, it would've been nice to have gotten a discount on our stay since we had to go through a hassle in getting our sinks fixed. Oh well!",2
"I don't know if my feelings would be as strong as Ester J's. I haven't tried the bailout plan so I can't comment on the positive review given by Chris P. What I can tell you is that cheese steak is horrible. The bread is soft, and anyone who knows cheesesteak, knows that the roll is vital. It has to have the correct taste and the perfect chew. Moreover, the steak itself resembled ground beef more than a cheesesteak. The cheese was nonexistent. The sweet peppers were not sweet, just bitter. n nAs for pizza, it is your basic bar pizza. It can't rival a bar pizza like the Rainbow Room in LA. Its a bar, and the pizza is okay, flavor not so bad, pepperoni is packaged, cheese is not pure whole milk mozzarella. n nThere is nothing wrong with going to Uncle Sams. It is what it is.",1
"I finally was able to get my windows tinted by Eco Tint thanks to a Groupon I got late last year. After seeing all the amazing reviews, I was planning on going here anyway, so the Groupon deal was a great bonus for me. n nI had some problems scheduling an appointment at first. they were off for a holiday and didn't even have a voicemail system for me to leave messages on. I talked about this with the owners and gave them some ideas on how to fix this problem. It was nice that they actually listen to their customers. n nThe waiting area was decent, as described in detail in other reviews. Wifi, satellite TV, drinks, etc. The tinting took just over 3 hours for me, which was a little longer than I expected, but the car looks great so I can't complain there. n nI also received a followup thank you note in the mail a few weeks later, which was a really classy touch. This place definitely has the best customer service in town, and it shows in the reviews here. Well done, guys.",2
"I went to the buffet last week and when I purchased the 2 for 1 coupon plan, I was told that they are closing in 40 minutes, but we still stayed to eat because that was the final day for the coupon. Anyway, the only thing that was good was the turkey. All of the extras were either old and cold or just awful looking. I will never go to the Seasons buffet again.",1
"Pretty much everything I wanted to say has been said in other reviews, but I'll repeat it anyway this place is awesome. n nI always have trouble with getting breakfasts, partly because I'm veggie, and partly because I tend to sleep in and miss out that way. But these guys serve brekkie all day, so I rocked up at lunch time and was rewarded with a near perfect rendition of my favorite eggs florentine. Perfectly poached eggs and cooked spinach, if I was being picky I'd just say the hollandaise sauce could have done with a bit more bite. But it was so good I stuck about for some lunch, partaking of their veggie sharing platter if cut down in size for my personal enjoyment . n nI'm a bit fussy with my coffee but there's no problem here, and my two Americanos were lovely and strong, just how I like them. n nThe proprietors are lovely friendly and smiling to me as a stranger, and to the many regulars that rolled in while I was there. n nWhat more can I say? I'll be back!",2
"Been here many times always for a Dbacks game. I really like the stadium itself, I've never had a bad view of the game even when getting the cheap sets. As usual the food is stupidly expensive but its what people have come to expect as part of the experience. The fans add to the luster or in this case, the lack of luster of the stadium. The Dbacks fans seem sedated, the only ones cheering are the opposition team's fans,which come out in droves and have always outnumbered dbacks fans. It doesn t have the electricity of a Wrigley field or a Busch stadium, but its still a good place to go to watch a ball game.especially if you cheer for the other team!",2
"If your looking authenic filipino food, thos is a must try place. The lechon belly is really delicious. The staff really knows the menu and always attends to ypur needs. Next time i visit Las Vegas, for sure i will eat at this place.",2
" ""I am one star yelping the SHIT out of this place! "" n nI knew this wasn't a good buffet. But a friend really wanted to try it. I don't think I ever need to go back. n nSERVICE I'm sorry, but piss poor. The cashiers are the type of people whom you can tell hate their jobs and hate life. Answering ""I don't know "" to basic questions about hours or champagne offerings, just to be lazy, when clearly, they do know. We waited 5 minutes for the dinner buffet, and asked for champagne. We told the woman that's why we waited 5 minutes. We were charged, got our bracelets, and went inside, only to be told that we had only been charged for the regular buffet. So we had to go back outside, pay more, and wait for a manager to come and re do the transaction. After the manager charged my friend and her boyfriend, the cashier let her go, forgetting that I had the same problem too. So we had to wait for her again. It seriously took us 20 30 minutes just to get in. And there was no line. n nFOOD It's buffet food, so I'm not sure what new I could say here. It looks like an expansive buffet, but the main buffet counter that runs the length of the restaurant is just a mirror image of the one on the other side. The guacamole was completely frozen. Yes, frozen. It was a large ball where the fresh guac had been scraped away by other diners, leaving the ice. Dumplings and sushi were horrible, but I'm sure you already knew that before reading this review. Some of the food was enjoyable and decent, which is why most people who come to this buffet are probably drunk. The pastas, orange chicken, and desserts weren't bad. n nDRINKS We paid for the all you can drink champagne, an extra 8. The ""bar "" was a small counter in the front of the restaurant, serving wine and beer. To get champagne, we had to go to the counter and pick up a tiny, nearly shot sized glass of it. For 8 and for such an inconvenient system, we began either pouring it into our water glasses, or finishing it as we got food so that we could be served more. I bought two bottles of wine for our table for 12 each, which wasn't a bad deal. They must rip people off on the champagne to encourage them to buy bottles of wine. n nNot really any redeeming qualities for this buffet, whatsover. Stick with the Spice Market or the Carnival buffets you'll save money, have better food, and be happier.",1
I'm so tired of walmart trying to be slick. We all know what takes place here. We enter for one item then we end up with a basket full of stuff then walmart shows their thanks to you by having only 3 cashiers available to get you out of the store. We have busy lives we trying to return to. What on earth are the owners thinking. I don't wish to spend 45 or 65 minutes with your cashier just in line looking stupid. The employees they work for you. I don't and I should not have to be forced to wait in line that long all because your to cheap selfish to hire more workers. I have family a life to return to. It sure would be nice if I could shop in peace then get out of the store in a timely but quick fashion. It's unacceptable that we must wait 60 to 65 minutes just to pay leave!,1
"Don't bother with this place. This is greasy diner food that can barely be classified as thai. If you are Asian or know what the real thing tastes like, go someplace else. I asked for three stars and the food had no spice. Got a vegetarian dish with tofu, but I had to poke around in the sauce to find any tofu. The waitress or owner who served us had an attitude. Maybe because I had a service dog with me? She exuded unfriendliness, barely spoke to us, put our food on the table and pretty much ignored us after that, except to bring the check when we got tired of waiting for her to appear with it and got up to leave.",1
"You must go to this place when in Vegas. I'm so glad I yelped for lunch ideas. It's in a strip mall near the airport and if you blink you may just miss it. When you walk in it can get kind of confusing. Have a friend grab a table if you can, get in line and place your order counter. This place was hopping at 11 30 and even busier as we left. One in our party got French toast bonjour br u00fbl u00e9e another had the blt bomb diggity and I had the shrooming in Philly a mushroom philly sandwich! The truffle fries and sweet potato fries were SO GOOD! One of my favorite things was actually the flavored Heinz ketchup jalape u00f1o and balsamic AMAZING ! Enjoy!",2
"Same with Wichcraft.their sandwiches were very tasty, fresh and well paired with unique condiments.excellent for a for a quick bite.but the WHOOPIE PIES.OH MY GAWD! HEAVEN!

"The restaurant was close to capacity this Sunday morning, but we were able to secure a table for 2 in the very chic dining room. Chef partner Johnny Church recently departed RX Boiler Room to open this restaurant that puts a spin on comfort food. It has proven to be so popular that a 2nd location has or will soon be opening in Summerlin. n nMy wife chose an order of lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry ginger compote that no one short of Fat Albert could possibly finish in one sitting. My avocado griddle eggs with tomatillo sauce, red onions, cilantro, poblano peppers and jack cheese over home fries was more than filling. Hers was good, mine was nothing short of excellent.",2
"I have to admit I didn't think I was going to get an as good meal as we did. We ended up going because we got a restaurant.com gift certificate and thought we'd try a new place. We've always passed it on Camelback and many time went to Oreganos next door, but never stopped. I am glad we went last week. n nThe menu is good sized and the prices were reasonable. We got the chicken stuffed with peppers and cheese and the Salmon and Spinach enchiladas. Both entrees were excellent. I was especially surprised by the enchiladas.you don't usually see salmon and spinach in an enchilada.and executed very well. We got the guacamole and lobster quesadilla for an app. The quesadilla was ""ok "", but the guacamole was very good. n nThe atmosphere is nice and cozy. The bar and patio areas are where you will want to site.they have a more authentic feel and the vibe is great. The dinning room is so so. n nThe service was superior and our waiter was way cool and made great recommendations. He was attentive and knowledgable about the food. He was a rock star in terms of service. n nOverall, I would say give this place a spin.it was a great meal. Why we never stopped there before, I'll never know.",2
Cookies are freshly baked and quite tasty! ice cream is good because its thrifty's but nothing special!,2
"Used to come to this place for sushi a couple years back. Idk what seemed to have changed management, quality of food , not sure but something has definitely changed for the worst. I decided to try it for the fourth time in the past two months, all trips were disappointing I must admit. Their quality of sushi, going straight down. This trip was my most recent one and will forever be my last. n nI am a huge sashimi fan. I ordered my usual salmon sashimi, but when it came out not only were their pieces tiny for the high price, I even found some dark splotches on it. After looking at them I quickly lost my appetite. n nSorry to say I won't be coming back and will stray away anyone who attempts to. Wish I could say differently. Sad, this place used to be good.",1

"my favorite Italian restaurant of Las Vegas. classic delicious Italian taste in contemporary look.Food reviews are different because understanding food and dining experience is very personal. not everybody would appreciate creativity, so that's why there are some bad reviews here.

"The entrees were dissapointing. The soups, salads and other sides that I tried were good. I have been to Bouchon 3 or 4 times, I live in LV so we came for my birthday. n nDo not get the gnocchi, you will be so sadly disappointed. It ruined my night, I feel like I want to cry about it, but I was too shy to say anything and embarrass the guy I was with. They're not soft at all, extremely dry when I had them. They do not taste handmade. DO NOT ORDER the gnocchi, the only thing good about them was the goat cheese on top. I hope I can at least help someone else not make the same mistake I did. n nThe lamb steak was delicious but very tough and not pleasant to chew, it came rare. n nThe pistachio ice cream is very unique and very very good. n nOur waiter was great though n nI gave the restaurant 4 instead of 3 stars because I don't like to make their ratings go down.",2
"Virtually any type of fabric you might be looking for can be found here, in addition to the notions that go with it such as buttons, thread, and ribbons to name a few. You might have to do some hunting around to find an associate to help you out though. In a world where fabric stores are a shrinking commodity, it's good to know that SAS still exists.",2
"Great beer selection. More tv's than you can shake a stick at, or anything else you want to shake at them. The service I must admit was pretty bad. Our waitress was slow, didn't really seem interested in serving us, but she was a real doll besides that. nFood was masticated with my chewing parts, so I will tell you what I thought. Bleh. nWeak even for bar food. If I was more drunk than I was, it may have been decent. Didn't stop me from eating it, but just plain old bleh. The Philly cheese steak was dryer than Cloris Leachman watching an autopsy, and the boneless chicken wings were were about as tasty as my sock. Onion rings and tater tots were pretty good. Skip the food, pound the beer and you'll be ok.",1
"After months of seeing the girls in the office enjoying what always appeared to be fresh pasta, I ventured into La Famiglia last week to finally give it a try and am kicking myself for not going 8 months ago when I started working in this area! n nThe wait is a little long for lunch, so don't go expecting something out of the microwave and in your hand in 5 minutes. It is all made baked to order and takes a little more time. With lunch specials of pasta, side salad and a drink for 5.95, it is well worth the wait! n nLast week I tried their Italian Hero sandwich, it was so good. I had always been a fan of Cousins Subs and didn't think anything would beat their Italian until I had it here. Today, I tried the stuffed shells. Again, delicious. Cooked to perfection and the flavors making my taste buds want more and more. My only gripe would be that they don't give you any garlic rolls with the lunch specials, and they are much needed for the sauce after your finished the pasta no note to self, next time order a side of them! n nI look forward to tasting each and every item on the menu in the next few weeks.",2
"I have to agree with all the other yelpers, this is a GREAT burger. After reading all the great yelp reviews, I took my family, including my out of town mom, for lunch on a Saturday and was not disappointed. I knew from the smell outside of the building that it was gonna be fantastic eats. We were happy with the service also. We had a party of six and did not have to wait. We will go back again and again and again.",2
"I came in tonight hoping for a great experience but was not impressed with the service it was slow and I had to return my salmon dinner also we needed our beverages refreshed but unfortunately our waiter didn't have the chance to come around and when he did we had finished our meals and were ready to go. I don't think we will come back, ",1
"No soup for you! .or at least that how we felt when George was banned by the Soup Nazi.what did we do to deserve this kind of treatment? n nTwice, the take out service left out part of our order, and when ya get home questioning the high price, anyway, you at least expect to get what you ordered. Oh ya, the food is good, but let's put it in the bag! It should be simple enough, ""No more stars for you ""!",1
"1.5 stars. I was excited as I rolled off my flight in the D concourse but the service only seemed to be for the carryout option at 9 30 disappointing and the take out was pretty crappy. I've had average sushi before and this joint, while nestled in a hip and fashionable looking section of the concourse, had pretty below average sushi. Avoid, especially considering the price.",1
Came in on a Saturday evening to answer a pregnancy craving for the wife. Placed order at 5 41 and didn't get our order until after 7. The BBQ isn't that amazing especially compared to other places in the valley. While we were there three people elected to get refunds rather than wait for their order to be filled. When they asked for an explanation regarding the wait the guy up front shrugged his shoulders and apologized. n nAgain it's not mind blowing food and will definitely look elsewhere for BBQ before coming here in the future.,1
"Downhill it is! n nTried Local Bistro again tonight drunk bread, risotto, arugula salad, prosciutto pizza. n nThe drunk bread was delicious, however, 10 for a big slice of bread it wasn't that delicious. n nRisotto was good but not exceptional. n nArugula salad was a little wilted and the dressing was gross, too sweet and gross. n nProsciutto pizza was not good.the prosciutto had very tough fat running through it, flavor was too sweet FYI, it is not heated as part of the pizza and the pizza base itself was completely bland. ""Wood fired "" may be true, I'm sure there is a wood that burns that gives off no flavor whatsoever if it had said ""toaster oven fired "" it would have better set my expectations. n nExtra bread on the side stale. n nOne last thing I'll mention, everything was stone cold except for the salad, that was slightly warm. n nLocal Bistro I want you to be great. I like your menu and you are close to my house. Can't someone stage an intervention with the kitchen staff?",1
only went here because sushi kaya was too busy. service was terrible finished my sapporo lady took the glass and didn't even offer or ask if I wanted another beer. it was really slow and they let all the dishes pile up five dollars for some soggy way too saucy Kim chi. would not return to this establishment. don't appreciate terrible service especially when the place is pretty much dead,1
"The place would have been OK if the bartenders weren't Pm'sing. There were two girls working that have no business being behind a bar. My friends and I were greeted by a tall beautiful brunette. With that being said that will be her only compliment, this girl was rude, surly and just down right mean. We actually felt intimidated to ask for another beer, we didn't want to inconvenience her while she cleaned with a down right hateful scorn to her face. It's a shame too, this town seemed to be like something out of a wild west movie. That was pretty cool, however I can assure you we will not be back!",1
"Service was slow, food was gross. After all the high reviews I don't know if we just had bad luck or what, but nothing was good about this place. n nWent for an early dinner on a Thursday. Around 5. There were only 2 3 couples in the place eating. We ordered drinks and calamari. The calamari should have a disclaimer that it isn't like what you expect. They were giant fish stick like pieces of what I would guess was squid but it tasted and chewed like rubber. It was barely edible. We order the king pot and gumbo. gumbo tasted like canned tomato soup with a few tiny shrimp and some sausage in it. It was the worst I've had. Wife's crab was good, but the rest of her dish had a funky taste. Took it home to try not to be rude since she barely touched it and dumped it in the trash. We both barely touched our food and were ready to go. Waiting brought out check and we still didn't have the drinks we ordered. We pointed this out since they were on the bill and we never got them. Instead of offering to take them off she just walks off and 10 minutes later brings us our drinks when our food is already boxed up to go. We each took a sip and then left. n nWould not return and of all the places in Arizona we have ate since moving here, this has been the worst experience.",1
" 30 am Jan 5th I stopped in for bacon and eggs , coffee and a glass of milk , sat at the counter.

Will not be back",1

I was hesitant to spray tan because my past experiences always left me orange and with uneven color that faded off in blotches. I basically had to cover up until it was gone but when I tried Sun Gun I was hooked. The products they use gave me great color for a week and faded perfectly.,2
"Overpriced rip off. Its bad enough that they charge 25 for an average weekend lunch buffet, but to throw you out at 3 pm is totally ludicrous.",1
"Fell in love with this place in New York Manhattan. This one here in Las Vegas can be skipped. Its terrible. The service is the worst, slow, hard to understand, and the sandwich here are just the same. If you love NY, stay out of this one in Vegas. Worst Meat I've ever looked at. Maybe the sound of the Casino ruin it, or the smell of Smoke? Vegas has a lot of great places to eat, scratch this one off",1
"This is my cousin's timeshare that we stayed at for the weekend. The price was reasonable, and the place was really nice! It was like a mini apartment, with a full kitchen, a living area with a kitchen table, couches and a flat screen TV, there was a hot tub, and another flat screen TV in the bedroom with a king size bed, and a full bathroom with two sinks. n nI am giving this place only 2 stars because it was at least a 10 15 minute ride from the strip. There was an 8 day shuttle that brought you back and forth which is a pretty good deal, but as a girl in my early twenties, I want to be on a strip when I'm in Vegas and the work to coordinate with the shuttle schedule or finding another way to the strip was a major buzzkill. n nAlso, these people LOVE their sales presentations. They offered us deals to shows, but we could only get the deals if we went to some presentation even though my cousin already owned the timeshare . Since we missed the sales presentation which BTW was scheduled at 10 AM Saturday morning, who does that? we couldn't get any of the deals. n nThe thing that really peeved me and brought this review to 2 stars is that fact that we had to call security, at least twice, and wait outside our room because our key cards wouldn't work. 2 of our 3 cards stopped working because they are 'sensitive'. I've stayed at many hotels before and never in my life have cards stopped working because they are too 'sensitive'. This was really annoying and the second time we had to call the front desk they were rude and probably assumed we were drunk, when in fact their cards just suck.",1
"great show! There was some older folks in the crowd that did not laugh at the dildo jokes.

"This is a neighborhood Thai restaurant, locally owned. As such I was eager to try the classic neighborhood Thai restaurant tradition.TAKEOUT! You can imagine my surprise when they refuse to let you take out anything off the lunch menu. What?! You have to order off the much more expensive dinner menu. So Pad Thai noodles for 7.98 on the lunch menu was not available to me. So I had to pay 11.98. That is insane. Just a warning if you're thinking about take out.",1
"As I write this review, I am steadily falling into a meatball food coma. It has been a few years since I went to their old Scottsdale location and seeing the fantastic photography on the front of their take out menu was enough to suck me in today. It has been at least a year or so since I have had a meatball sub, but theirs looked SO good! I guess I am sucker for advertising. Truth be told, though, it was very good. There seemed an endless supply of meatballs in my 10 inch sub I gave my 3 year old a quarter of it, so I am not a total pig! . Cue in the juvenile snickers from my husband when I told him I ate about 7 inches of the sub. The sub was a little too saucy for me, but not enough to prevent me from ordering it again. I am sooo looking forward to trying this location's stuffed pasta and hope it is as good as when I used to go!",2
"The food here is very good. All of the tapas appear to be good. Got several and enjoyed them with my wife, and father.

"Thumbs down! n nOur server was professional and to the point. n nFood was disappointing other than the Lasagna. The signature dish, Osso Bucco was tasteless, dry and bland. Pork dish was really sad and not even close to what it should be. n nThree members of our party had medium stage food poisoning. including myself The common denominator was the 18.00 tomato and Mozzarella salad. n nWith so many great restaurants in Vegas you really don't need to hit Sinatra's.",1

After my wife and I dined on the flatbread, scallops and trout, we were convinced that in order to add flavor to their reduced calories, they poor on the salt. n nI read a few reviews here that mentioned bland taste. Possibly the management read the same reviews and asked their kitchen staff to open the salt shakers? It really spoiled what could have been a nice experience. n nAnd skip the salads. Very over priced for what amounts to a plate of mixed greens and little else. IMO, True Foods does a much better job. n nOn the pro side, the restaurant is very nicely designed with a pleasant atmosphere and good lighting. And the wait staff was attentive and polite.",1
"Upon our return, in which we were comped a gift card, the service was excellent, the food even better! I have even received an apology from the waiter. This is my favorite place to eat by far! The oysters are delicious, the Bloody Mary will knock your socks off, the fish is delicious and even something as simple as the cole slaw made with wasabi is absolutely decadent! I will be back many , many more times!",2

"I don't know if we go up and order or what? When we walked in, it was a little busy. It was EDC weekend so there were a lot of people that looked like they were stopping by to get some Boba. n nWe easily were able to seat ourselves at an available table. It look like there were about 2 servers on the floor. Let me tell you, they kept passing us up and even served other tables that sat down after us. It was probably a good 15 minutes before they recognized we had no menus. That was until we finally said, ""Umm, yes we are here, can we get menus? "" n nI ordered a hot medium cup of mango tea. It was really delicious. Overly priced, for sure. It was 4 for a cup of tea. Good tasting tea, but not knock my socks off let me spend another 4 for a cup of tea. n neeeeh, I've definitely had better service and tea.",1
"I am a huge fan of In N Out, but at this location I had a HORRIBLE experience. I ordered my food to go with some friends and when I took a bite of my double double I saw that there was MOLD on the bottom of my bun. I was so disgusted I could not eat for the rest of the day. The other people in my group had nothing wrong with their food, so I was the unlucky one. I contacted corporate about the issue and they sent me vouchers for two free meals during my next visit at any In N Out but I do not plan on going back for a while.",1
Cheap but food tasted weird. Would not go back.,1
"After being told that if everyone in our party didnt show up for our reservation, we would be charged 50 person penalty wtf! , we all showed up on time to find the place half empty for Saturday brunch . They should have been kissing the floor we walked for our business.jeez. n nAnyways, onto the Pros n white peach margarita not too sweet, but still very tasty. nice and tart n bread basket the BEST bread basket I've EVER had. complete with blue corn muffins, blueberry coffeecake, jalapeno cheddar scones, tequila scones, and some other really yummy scone thing. they gave us plenty of each so everyone in my group had a taste of everything. n egg chilaquiles I think I misunderstood what these are supposed to be, but regardless, the dish was amazing! Think scrambled eggs on top of corn tostadas which were layered with white cheddar. Everything was covered in this delicious green sauce. The sauce was soo flavorful, I couldnt stop eating even though I was wayy to full from the bread basket and appetizer. n nCons n goat cheese fundido well, not a con cause it was gooood. but nothing special. n I had seen this mushroom quesadilla appetizer on their lunch menu online, but since we were there for brunch, they only had these other salmon quesadillas. I asked them if they could make me a mushroom one, and they refused saying that the ingredients wouldnt have been prepared. Maybe I'm naive about these things, but um it was 12 30.and they had all the quesadilla fixings put together for brunch anway.just add the mushrooms! I'm paying enough to deserve a little more flexibility. Again, shows you how puffed up they are. n nAll in all, the bread basket and the chilaquiles make up for not giving me a mushroom quesadilla.",2
"I come here for the rice cakes and dessert! I've tried their wonton noodle, and it was decent. There xlb is ok also! But I enjoy the simple casual atmosphere! The building is a stand alone and you can't miss it ! Service is good too!",2
"I had them come out last week and they did an excellent job. Couldn't be happier with their work. They provided an estimate for me with photos taken of my yard, which was really convenient. Will definitely use them again! Thanks!",2
"Went on a saturday night,had a few beers and declined the meal because it was just disgusting, completely not edible. went to go play pool and durnign the first game we saw a cook with a plate of food in hand and two PLUNGERS in the other, bringing the food into the restroom while putting the plungers back wonder what they were even doing in the kitchen .realized why the food was so ransom, never ever ever again",1
"Probably not fair to review since we left without eating. It was so LOUD. The music was shaking the glasses. The server had to bend over the table and shout ""do you want STILL WATER OR BOTTLED WATER. "". That did, it we were out the damn door. n nWHY do place feel they have to make you DEAF to eat there? Really? n nMaybe I will order take out if they agree to bring it out to the parking lot. Oh, and that is already a nightmare, with another restaurant yet to open there soon.",1
"We go here for dinner about 1 2 times a month and decided to have our wedding rehearsal dinner here a couple weeks ago. There were about 30 of us. We were impressed, and didn't expect everything to run as smoothly as it did. Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was exceptional. Amanda took great care of us, she knew exactly when drinks and food needed to be refilled without reminders. The tinga tacos were delicious and the chocolate churro tower was amazing!",2
I love this place! Their pistachio gelato is amazing! It's the best pistachio ice cream I've ever had. mixed with LOTs pistachios! I always try a whole bunch of flavors but every time still end up getting the pistachio. Although after they moved to this new place it seems like they haven't been able to get their AC working. One time i was there and it was so hot inside that one of their freezers stopped working or something.,2
I love jimmy johns! Way better than other fast sandwich restaurants. Just had a bad experience though. I always order the Italian night club with hot peppers on the side. This location though the cashier refused to give my peppers on the side! Is it that hard to put some peppers into a cup? I don't think that's too much to ask for.,1
"Our family made a bad decision to grab dinner here and it will not happen again! Out of four of us, no one finished their meal they were barely edible. The chicken and vegetables tasted frozen thawed old and the egg rolls were. well, just plain gross. I usually prefer to write positive reviews, but I just can't for this place.",1
"Marchmont Hardware is a great handy business in Marchmont which provides a good range of cooking utensils, tools and even mini vacuum cleaners for hoovering up crumbs on the tabletop an amazing invention. The guys who run it are pleasant, helpful and offer to find any products which they don't have in stock or recommend where you might find them. nMy only criticism is that some of the things which they sell are a bit gimmicky and pointless. For example, they were displaying an electronic rotating ice cream cone! Does that appeal to anyone? Possibly, but I can't help but feel that they'd benefit from specialising in stuff which people actually need. Nevertheless, Marchmont Hardware offers top service and a great range of products at good prices.",2
"the only problem that we had was it seems that parts and labor prices were on the high side. This is a used car and our first VW. Service wise other than the prices. This is a very friendly and attentive place for service. work was done in a very quick and professional manner. Great job guys, just not sure on pricing.",2
"Stay away! This place is horrible. Some of the worst service I have ever received. Unfortunately, this is the only place for us to get warranty work done. As soon as we can get everthing fixed, we will never be back. n n nIf you still choose to do business with these folks, don't say you weren't warned. You will be sorry.",1
"BY FAR THE BEST TASTING FALAFEL IN MONTREAL! n nHOWEVER.,the service experience can be a hit or miss all depending on their mood. Most of the time it's a miss. I always get nervous when I walk into this place. They never say hello when you walk in, they could be watching their Lebanese soap opera and you might be disturbing them in the process of trying to give them your order. So sometimes you wait, and wait, and wait until they actually look at you. They take your order without any acknowledgement as if they're doing you a favor. Furthermore, they talk in Arabic among others and make you feel stupid. Over the years I used to laugh and would tolerate their behavior thinking that it was just like in a scene from a Seinfeld episode except this was only darker. After today's experience I decided to NEVER step foot into this place again. You will notice on their walls they have almost 50 pics if not more of the Virgin Mary. this is probably due to their guilt by treating their customers like shit. They can take their falafels and go to hell because I'm not going back. n nThe FALAFEL NAZI's are not funny!",1
"Check your bill. When I asked why I was overcharged, dude claimed that the prices on the menu were ""old prices "".",1
"What a cluster this airport is! It is dark and drab and the people who work here are not very friendly unlike they claim to be . My boyfriend and I recently had a layover here. When we arrived, we were informed that our flight would have am hour and a half delay. We were ok with this as it gave us time to get a bite to eat. 20 min before our flight was supposed to leave, they made an announcment that our gate was changed TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AIRPORT! n nAs we speed walked our way with the rest of the passengers on our 100 full flight, we realized that they changed two more flights to the section we were going to. Once we arrived, they announced that a flight was changed BACK to the original gate. The announcement was so unclear that many people on our flight started heading back when the airport personel finally clarified that it was one of the other flights that changed back. n nThese people need to get it together.",1
"The waiter here sucks can't even understand her, my order came in wrong , they charge for extra lettuce. It took forever for them to take our orders it was a slow night and service stinks here. The menu has changed n nHorrible service",1
Yup. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. I guess waking up and opening your store on time every day is too much for this business owner. You call yourself a King? Maybe a King of Sleeping. The few times your store was open when it was suppose to be i thought your donuts were bomb. Unfortunately I don't have time to wait all day for you. I dethrone you dude.,1
This firm has been very helpful in taking care of my ticket that went into warrant. Thank you for all your help and I will definitely recommend your firm to my friends and family,2
"Many years ago I had some not so good experiences with Firestone shops and have avoided them since. Luckily for me one of my tires decided to all but blow up tread flapping loudly but amazingly air still in the tire , very near this shop. n nI drove the half block from where I'd pulled over to check the damage, noisily slap slap slapping the whole way, my friend telling me there was no way I was going to make it before the tire went totally flat. The tire held, as I knew it would, and we pulled into the Firestone. n nOnce inside I had to wait only a few minutes before Chad, the very pleasant store manager, came over to see what I needed. At that time all I wanted was to have the spare put on and the mangled tire zipped up in the spare tire purse. What are those things called? n nTo my surprise he had a technician pull my car in and take care of it right away. We were only there for about 15 minutes, it would have been much less time had the poor guy not had so much trouble getting the tread flapping tire all zipped up. To my even greater surprise when I went to pay, Chad said, ""No charge "". Okay, starting to kinda like this place. Nice customer service. n nWhen I got home and begin pricing tires I was again surprised to find that Firestone was only a little bit more for comparable tires than the other big Discount tire place nearby. I decided to spend the extra 8 at the Firestone because of the great customer service I received. Oh maybe that was their plan all along.go figure. n nI went back in armed with my internet prices and knew exactly what tires I wanted and how much it should cost. Justin, the brand new shop manager, He literally just got to Phoenix the day before, welcome to Phoenix Justin greeted me when I came in even though he was helping another customer. n nWhen he was free he looked up the tires I wanted and informed me they needed to be ordered but he could have them in less than an hour. I couldn't wait due to an appointment I had later in Chandler. I had Justin order the tires so they would be there the next day. n nI asked Justin if they were the same as the on line price, he verified that they were and I said I'd hoped they'd be even less. He promised to see if he could do anything about that when I came in the next day. n nThe next afternoon I dropped off my car and waited at Manuels Mexican restaurant a block away Great Mexican food and Ritas . It took a bit longer than expected but I didn't really care. n nWhen I got back to pick up my car Justin went a step beyond his word and somehow managed to get me a great deal on the tires, including the road hazard. He also had my car fully checked out and told me that I didn't need anything else, my car was in good shape. n nNo up selling, no trying to get me to buy an air filter or another service I didn't need. He had told me that it was his policy to never sell a customer something they do not need and then proved it by giving my car a clean bill of health. n nSo, if you are in the North Valley and need work done on your car, think there might be something wrong, or you need new tires go see Chad and Justin. They are amazing and run a great shop! n nI was going to give them only 4 stars with a mention that I would give them 4.5 is possible but after writing this I think I'm going with the 5 since they are closer to a 4.75. Seriously, go see them!",2
"Ok, don't know where to start.the place is nice. Paintings, decorations, comfortable chairs, high ceilings, huge building hard to miss.big sign advertising happy hour! So I had to stop. We asked for chips and salsa because even though is complimentary is only served to those who ask. nWe also asked about the happy hour specials and were told that it's only happy hour at the bars, not the main dining room. Ok, I'm already feeling stupid paying full price when the person 3 feet away is in a different price zone. But I'm already seating here eating the chips. Didn't seem right to move and start a new bowl of chips somewhere else. I'm not going to upset the waiter, I'll just be upset myself! nOk back to the main dish! This is not. let me repeat.this is not, your regular Mexican food. everything is made with a different twist. Even though we wanted Mexican food we ended up eating Nouvelle Mexique Cuisin al France. Nonetheless the food was good and so were the margaritas. Service? Was very good even tough they should have warned me I was sitting in the ""you'r going to pay more than anyone else, while happy people look at you. "" area. nCheck please! Or should I say. L'addition S'il vous plait? Little too pricey for Mexican food.unless, YOU'R SITTING IN A HAPPY AREA!",2
"Puckett's calls itself a 21st century honkytonk which is an accurate description of the place. This place started off as a farm equipment dealer until the owner discovered that he was making more money selling beer when farming died down in the area! nMy first impression of the place was pretty good.The beer was cold and reasonably priced, the music was loud without being overwhelming, and it wasn't stuffy inside the ceilings are high and the fans circulate air . There is live music on the weekends, mostly country, bluegrass, honkytonk, rockabilly.you know.good down home music o There is usually a modest cover charge which goes to band. ",2
"Great place to impress a first date, just make sure it's payday. Great food and atmosphere with just the right amount of class and sophistication. Live music is a big plus when available.",2
"I have a secret. I'm a menu whisperer. As soon as I flipped the page to the entree section the miso glazed Chilean sea bass serenaded me. n n I'm more than just an option. Hey hey heeeeeey. Refused to be forgotten. Hey hey heeeeeey. n nWhen the waiter told me it's one of their more well known dishes I was sold. Sure, they forgot about me and thought I was only eating a side of brown rice but when my sea bass came out oh boy did it find my lovin'. You can never go wrong with fattiest fish of the sea! n nIf I were to describe the party in my mouth it would be like P. Diddy's white party in the Hamptons with loads and loads of cocaine and orgies in every room. MY KIND of party. n nThe individual bowls of rice can definitely feed more than one person so save yourself a whopping 4 and share one with a friend. Also, when you dine here and purchase an entree you can ask for a stamp to get into the club that helps you bypass a loooooong ass line. n nBut enough with the tips! The take home point of this review is ORDER THE SEA BASS. You will not be disappointed!",2
Delicious! The meat is tender and everything is fresh. I had the torta and it was amazing. I love the set up of this place. I haven to say that originally even though the set up is nice I was a bit sceptical but they exceeded my expectations. I absolutely recommend this place to my friends. I work at zappos so it looks like i found a new spot for lunch!,2
"Love this place. Can be a little hectic on the weekends, but I usually order for pickup anyway. n nThe square pizzas are ok but pretty greasy so I avoid them. The pizza with the truffle oil is swimming in oil to the point where its a little inconvenient. The calamari, meatballs and eggplant pizzettes are KILLER. The salads are whatever. but why are you getting a salad at a pizza place?",2
"First sign a ramen shop is good is a long line and Monta won't dissapoint in wait and excellent ramen. Ramen starts at the broth and the Shoyu based soup had excellent soy flavor without the overwhelming saltiness common in the more mediocre varieties. The noodle is firm and doesn't get soggy absorbing the soup base. Gyoza are prepared well, some crispy spots but still soft and moist. The only bad thing is now my favorite ramen shop is 300 miles from my southern california home.",2
"BE WARNED READ THE FINE PRINT! nI'll admit I was a sucker and swayed by handsome young salesman who came to my door. I hadn't had my home sprayed in some time and had seen a few unseemly critters scurrying across the floor on occasion. I let him talk me into a one year contract that included half price on the first visit if I signed up for autopay that day. I initialed where it said I'd pay a 150 fee if I canceled, in spite of the voice in my head that said, ""Really? You need this? "" n nService wise they show up and do what they say they'll do. At least I assume so I was never home after the first visit but would instead come home to a note on my door saying they'd been by to service the property. n nCustomer service wise, however, they rank quite low. They have a bit of a scam operation going on, with an ""automatic renewal "" after your contract is fulfilled, written into the fine print. It states that you must specifically tell them, in writing no less, if you don't want them to continue beyond your contract date. n nI moved to a different home mid way through the contract, and I called them to give them the new address. At that time, I confirmed how many months were left on my contract. Silly of me to assume that actually ASKING how many months remain on my contract might indicate that I was not interested in continuing regular service beyond that date. Maybe this would be a place for her to ask or remind me that the service would automatically renew if I didn't specifically cancel. Oh but wait, why do that? That might lead to someone actually confirming that they want to cancel. Better to wait and get at least one more month out of them. n nAs a result of my naivety, Dispatch showed up after the contract end date to service my property against my wishes. When I found the ""we've been here "" note on my door and called to inquire, it was explained that while the salesman didn't explain this part of their policy, it is in the contract. Just a ""so sorry, don't know what to tell you. "" When I pointed out the previous phone call during which I had inquired about months remaining, the response was, ""Well I made no note of it, so you didn't ask us to cancel. "" In other words, whether or not my intent was clear didn't matter. You have to say the specific words, PLEASE CANCEL. I offered to compromise, since it appears we both made a mistake, and asked for a discount on the final service. Again, the answer was, ""No, it's in your contract and you didn't specifically ask us to cancel. "" n nAlrighty then. I actually probably would have used them again on occasion I just didn't want to have an automatic service. Now I feel scammed and irritated both at myself, and at the sleazy and borderline unethical business practices of the company. n nLesson learned.",1
Excellent quality. We ordered the half chicken and chicken soup. Everything was very flavorful and fresh. A nice little place. Recommended!,2
"OK, I just came here for Happy Hour, but McCormick touts itself as having the "" 1 happy hour in America "" and a lot of people come here for that so a review of it is fair. n nBottom line this is Vegas. A million better deals can be found in a million places all over this town. And you don't even need happy hour to get most of them every single bar or restaurant that is low to mid end has drink specials that are superior to here. n nI've been to other McCormick's and the food here was just not up to par. Burger was meh. Fortunately, the carpaccio is good! I would say it's a must order, if you like carpaccio. And the calamari was good as well. n nBut do NOT order the happy hour AHI. EVER. It was the saltiest, tiniest portioned, most unappetizing thing I've ever eaten. It must have been triple salted on the crust. I had to spit it out, it was so terrible. n nWhen I got the bill i was surprised it ended up being like 54 for two people for happy hour and it didn't include Coors Light as a happy hour special. Gave it a shot but I doubt I'll be back here.",1
"I rarely ever have a bad experience with this Denny's. The waiters are always there to refill your drinks and your food comes out shortly after you order. Occasionally I have gotten greasy food that was not as good as the times before and after , but that is not common for this location. My favorite waiter is Lisa. She is very friendly and talkative, and she is great at remembering what you regularly order. Overall this is an excellent place to get food, especially if you want a quick bite for a low price.",2
"This is my new favorite local pizza place! They have really good pizza that's not too greasy but still can maintain an authentic ""new york style. "" Also I LOVE LOVE LOVE their zeppoles.",2
Wow! Great late night coffee shop! We ordered the cafe latte and the kona mocha frappachino. My husband ordered the teramisu and I was debating on the cheesecake vs the Italian lemon cake. The guy was real helpful in helping me decide. I went with the cheesecake. He mistakingly brought the lemon cake and said no worries keep the lemon cake and brought a cheesecake! I got to have both cakes I wanted for the price of one! He was all smiles and pleasant. We will be back for sure ! The service was great and The latte was even better!,2
"Valentines Dinner 2013! n nQuestion for you.Where does a Yelper celebrate Valentines? A restaurant that's been bookmarked, that's where. No quiet candle light, no short walk around town, and no 5 star restaurant. I'm just as romantic as it gets. n nGeisha Steakhouse is located on the eastside of town. Not the best neighborhood at night, but nothing stands in my way when it comes to food. Their normal menu is put on hold for Valentines so the choices are Their Valentines Dinner 99 , Seafood Lover 40 each person , or their Land Lover 40 each person . I wanted to try their Land Lover, which consisted of their Rib Eye, Chicken and Filet Mignon. I wanted this so bad, but couldn't since I dropped red meat for Lent. My Valentine and I opted for the Seafood Lover which consists of Shrimp, Scallops, Lobster, and fried rice. I admit, this meal was pretty damn good. All three seafood pieces looked, tasted great, and was flavorful. I've always loved lobster and shrimp, now scallops are becoming a new favorite. Because it was seafood, the meal wasn't too filling in the beginning. In other words, I wasn't initially full. It wasn't until I finished my fried rice that I became stuffed. I was so full that my second Valentine venture was going to be a tough one to accomplish. n nI enjoyed the ambiance that almost all Teppanyaki restaurants have to offer. Geisha Steakhouse has that same type of ambiance group type seating, entertaining skillfull teppanyaki chefs, and great tasting food. n nI really can't wait until Easter so I can come back and try their chicken and filet mignon. You definitely can't go wrong with this place since there's a selection. n nPS I love me some lobster. Geisha's was good, but they also reminded me that I must take a trip back to Lobster Me for their Lobster Mac N' Cheese.",2
"I thought this place was pretty baller, getting us in even on a Saturday night fast and out in an hour. The burgers were way good, the fries and onion rings were some of the best, and their waiters were very attentive. Never has so many calories been so good at Red Rock. n n The only thing that's off is that the windows are given this weird thigh high pattern lace that looks like something out of an 80s music video vixen's closet.",2
"Came here on a Friday night for Jesse's birthday. It's right up the street from our humble abode, which adds the awesome cuz we're definitely coming back. n nBefore embarking on our quest, I browsed the Gasper's site and found that I could make an online reservation. So I did. Not that we really needed it, we were chomping early so the place wasn't anywhere near capacity. Upon walking in I scoped the interior and found it to be tres bitchin. Mood lighting and cool wall things and other things as well which were cool, I gotta say someone put their big boy decorating pants on. n nAt first I thought our server was a miserable bitchy Buzz Killington, but she turned out to be very awesome, just rough around the edges. We immediately ordered the bruschetta, which was prepared fresh so it took some time. This we made do with, even though I was foaming at the mouth. The wait was worth it, as the bruschetta was awesome. So were our entrees. I had the salmon and Jesse ordered her trusty chicken parm. At one point, one of the other servers faked like he was going to topple our tough old broad server's tray. Her eyes flashed and she almost came unhinged on the poor flamboyant fellow. Easily the highlight of my night. n nJesse's highlight was the pumpkin cheesecake, delivered on the house by the owner since it was our first time there. All in all, this place rocks. Check it out post haste.",2
These guys are awesome! I recommend Buddy! Thanks for the new ink. See you next time im in Vegas!,2
"I am really surprised I haven't reviewed this place. I have been to the actual location 3 4 times, but I usually get my B B fix at Grouchy John's. n nA friend originally purchased a chocolate tart from GJs. It literally ranked top three for the best things I have ever put in my mouth. I was on a quest to find that delicious tart's origin. I went to Albertson's, Smith's and checked several bakeries. I eventually went to GJs, but they had no tart. I did, however discover where that tart was made and the rest is history. n nSo yeah the chocolate tart here is beyond amazing. No words, it just amazing. n nBanana Nutella Muffin very good. A regular treat for me. n nBlueberry Muffin Good, but the Nutella is better. It does have a ton of fresh blueberries, and it's tasty. I don't want to discount that, I'm just more of a chocolate girl. n nRed Velvet Bagel Just ok. The cream cheese that comes with it is actually gross opt for your own. n nChocolate chip cookie Too much chocolate. Yes, too much! I never thought that was possible, but long behold. n nThe Hostess cupcake It's disgusting. Every time I've ever gone to B B they've spoken so highly about this cupcake. The cake part of it is ok, but there's some weird coconut concoction that taste like vaseline. Just nasty. n nThe service is great. I've never had an actual meal here just the desserts. Definitely worth a stop.",2
"Breads and croissants are really good here. My favorite was the almond croissant buttery, flaky, and rich with a hint of almond paste perfect for breakfast with their coffee and or tea. The cakes and small pastries were the typical French fare, nothing special. Service was quick and efficient. It gets crowded here during breakfast, but worth it for the croissants.",2
"Sadly, I went to pick up my yummy food last Friday night and there was a sign inside saying they were CLOSING 12 20 due to the fact they had lost their lease! After drying my tears, I asked what happened and the server told me the landlord didn't renew the lease and instead is leasing to a 'burger joint' WHAT? nI am heart broken! I sincerely hope they decide to find another place in the area soon! There are open spaces in the strip mall at Kyrene Elliot hint hint ",2
"As a diehard Packer fan living in Phoenix, I have been going to Casey Jones' for 4 seasons almost every Sunday. Each year has progressively gotten worse than the last. Service is appalling, food quality is dirt poor except for the wings , everything is filthy, and the hospitality, overall, is terrible. A week ago I went in it started the season off on a bad note. I even called the manager over to explain that I am a loyal customer and hadn't seen it this bad EVER. He didn't have much to say as I gave him some gentle feedback on my experiences, he didn't even apologize or thank me for my loyal business. I pledged to myself I will never drop another nickel in that place again after that. Not even for a DIE HARD Packer fan.",1
"This one is my favorite buffet so far! So good in fact that I went for dinner one night and then lunch the next day! I felt like there were more choices at this buffet than some of the other ones I visited during my trip. One of my favorite stations was the pho noodles one. There were different types of noodles and different broths to choose from. Oh, and they had roasted pig! You know, the one with the crispy pork skin. Mmmmm!",2
"Carts are always filthy. Most kids working there are what I call ""don't cares "". They need lessons in customer service. Check your receipt as the wrong prices often ring up. The older checkers are so slow it is painful. The produce is bruised and pitiful. Their meat is the more expensive than most without justification.",1
"By far the better of the two locations. If it was not for my friend wanting to drive around before dinner, I would still be going to the Paradise location. These two are like polar opposite siblings one is the dark party monster while the other is a more laid back social butterfly. n nThe reasons to love the Sahara location. n1 The fireplace is a nice touch that gives off a more chill atmosphere. n2. High ceilings and adequate lighting makes it look larger. n3. It is not crazy busy, so we were sat right away. n4. Staff are quick to drop off food, remove dirty plates, refill drinks, and even pour my sangria for me. n5. For the first time in eons, I checked the bill and it was right. The last three times my group went to the other one, we had to get things removed because they never came or they ran out and didn't take it off. n6. Food is still delicious Different presentation style then the other one, but flavors are spot on. n7. Right now they have Pumpkin Beignets. They are not really beignets, more like donut holes, but still delicious. n nThe reason to dislike the Sahara location. n1. If you are sitting on the high tops near the door, a cold draft hits you every other minute. n nThe Lamb Skewers were tender and juicy. They sat on a bed of lentils. I would have been happy with just a bowl of these phenomenal legume. The purple onions contributed to the flavor and gave them a nice bite. Duck Roll with a hoisin reduction will always be high on my list of to get items. The Stuffed Dates and Patatas Bravas are also crowd pleasers. n nWe made the mistake of getting a pitcher between the two of us. 28 is a great deal compared to the regular price for two glass, so it was a no brainer to just man up. This man will be giving up alcohol for a while.",2
"So here's my story of how I ended up as a patient of Horizon Spine Sport. I was in a minor car accident a few months ago and I developed some neck and upper back pain and well, that sucked. I ask my friends who are chiropractic aficionados who they would refer me to and I'm directed to Dr. Chuck Badger. I can't speak personally for the other doctor at this practice as all my treatment has been provided by Dr. Badger. n nSorry Yelpers not really sorry , but when it comes to medical professionals, you are not my first resource for research. Perhaps more reviews like this will change that for future Yelp seekers. n nAfter a really easy initial appointment set up with Janine the office coordinator extraordinaire , I come in and see Dr. Badger. n nThey have appointments after standard business hours! This is is super helpful for those of us that work 9a 5p, so I don't have to take time off of work for my three times per week chiropractic appointments. n nWhat I appreciated most about Dr. Badger on the initial consultation was the time taken to explain the spine and the muscles and the effects of trauma and how these could be remedied with treatment. I am one of those patients that likes to be educated on what is going on, and I believe that an educated patient is a compliant patient. If you tell me ""because I said so "", well, I'm going to tell you to kick rocks with open toed shoes and seek treatment elsewhere. n nInitial consultation comes and goes and treatment commences! Prior to seeing Dr. Badger, I'd never received chiropractic care so having things explained to me as they happened was greatly appreciated. He addressed the pain and injuries caused by the car accident and he also treated pain related to your standard desk job which was exacerbated in the car accident . n nOn more than one occasion, I have dozed off on the table when receiving electrical muscle stimulation in my upper back, thanks to the low lights and quiet of the office. And Dr. Badger is a huge sports fan so inevitably you will see a game on the flat screen TVs one in the lobby and one by the treatment tables so if you don't end up napping, you can catch a few plays. This falls in line with his practice taking care of athletes injuries, too. n nAfter several months of successful treatment, I'm nearly discharged. I feel significantly better than when I started treatment, and probably better than I did even before the car accident, and that's due to Dr. Badger's skill as a chiropractor. Dr. Badger has a great manner with patients, from young to old and from athletes to car accident patients and all in between, I have only ever seen him be pleasant with all. n nThat pleasant demeanor is also expressed by Janine who is great in her own right. Ever deal with nasty staff at a great doctor's office that you're hesitant to return to the great doctor because the staff is so nasty? That will never be the case here. n nHorizon Spine Sport is a top notch practice and I would recommend them to anyone seeking chiropractic care.",2
We always enjoy a good lunch at any Pita Jungle.,2
The young lady with all the attitude who works mornings during the week at this location has tried to ruin our day for the last time. There's never justification for rudeness and becoming mouthy with paying customers. We've taken our business to another location in the area and it is so much better.,1
"This review is for the lady who answers their phone, Cheryl. The plumber who came to fix our leaking shower head was fine, but he didn't have a receipt or invoice to leave so he stated he would ask the office to email one. When we didn't receive one, I called and this lazy woman was completely rude as if I was bothering her to do her job, Then she hung up on me. wth? This company is not even worth it. There's many others to choose from that doesn't include the rudeness with their service.",1
"I don't think I've ever eaten at Macaroni Grill before, and if I have, it's been a really long time.but we had a great meal, great service and I would recommend this location for sure! Probably would give 3.5 stars if I could, but decided to round up based on attentive service and the fact that overall the dining expereince at this Macaroni Grill in the Ballantyne area was very good! Not a higher score solely based on that my experience didn't wow me, but for a chain restaurant it was a solid experience and a great place to eat a casual meal! n nWe started with tomato bruschetta which was very good tomatoes tasted freshly prepared and bread was grilled just right! I selected Pollo Limone Rustica which was chicken in a lemon basil sauce with penne pasta and was baked to achieve a crusty top with creamy pasta and spinach underneath very good and a large portion with plenty of leftovers for lunch! He had Chicken Marsala and very much enjoyed it as well the sauce looked just right! n nI would definitely return to sample some of the other dishes offered and maybe try one of the desserts that looked really good!",2
Based on the reviews I was excited to try it however based on the tip I can verify its closed. There is now graffiti on the building.,1
"Will never go back again. It was great when Kiesha was there, but that all changed when she was gone. n nDropped off my 3 toy poodles and the 3 women working there were not very friendly seemed like they all did not get along. I had asked if the rate was discounted because I was bringing in 3 dogs and the one lady said yes since my ""discounted "" rate was written on the dogs information card. When I went to go and pick up the dogs, the 3 women were arguing very loudly and would not stop very unprofessional. I went to pay and they would not honor the discount even though it was written on the information card. They denied ever saying that there is a discount and would explain why the discounted price was written on the card.",1
"Wow reading the reviews on here I am either one of the few lucky ones or management has made some changes as my salesman hinted at during the sales process. I also used the service department so I will break the review down into two parts. n nSales nAs many of the negative reviews have even said this was pretty easy and much less hassle than other dealerships. Found a 2008 mustang I was interested in at west sahara location which I live closer to but didn't appreciate their salesman pressure and sending me a letter in the mail to come back and see him which I never authorized my mailing address to be solicited but anyways I contacted this location and spoke with Lorenzo my salesman would definetly recommend who within a couple days got it over to henderson location. The process from here was very quick and simple test drove it loved it put my credit app on got approved and was ready to go within a couple hours. I liked dealing with my one salesman the entire process he was polite professional and showed me on his screen every single step of the process. It was nice not dealing with the hassle and hours of work dealerships can be. Had no pressure and they made me feel comfortable car is great had it about a month now and put close to 3000 miles on it. n nService n nReading other reviews I was very worried about what I would have to deal with when I needed to make an appointment to have a couple things minor checked out within my 30 day warranty. While it wasn't perfect it was much better than I had anticipated. A couple door trims loose inside car 2 of them were able to be reattached. Front brakes were making some noise. I was ready to get the ""they are within carmax standard "" response which I did get but they said they were still going to replace the front brake pads and resurface rotors. It took a whole day and I needed to go to work they told me I wasn't getting a loaner at first had to fight for a bit on that one but they caved in and gave me one. Jason and brent manager treated me well and kept me informed during the two occaison I had it in fit service. n n nOverall great experience buying minus one star for having to fight them a bit getting a loaner car and also when a trim part came in it took them awhile to call and notify me. Would recommend overall",2
"Best Greek restaurant in town! We've been to the one in Miami, Vegas and they are all amazing! The food is 5 star quality, so as the service, ambiance. Love their extended wine list, the price range are pretty good and there is always something for everyone. n nThe milos special is divine, they also have the best crab cake baklava in town. The lobster pasta, lamb chops and fish are absolutely amazing! n nIt's obviously not cheap but worth every penny! Try it and you won't regret it.",2
"Oh my. this was a great surprise find outside of Las Vegas near Henderson . The pizza was amazing, thin crust and crispy, and the freshest toppings. absolutely awesome ! The oven roasted sweet red peppers and Italian sausage. oh my. I definitely will go back to this place the next time I visit Vegas. Worth the drive taxi to try authentic NY style pizza with fresh and tasty ingredients with friendly wait staff.",2
The pad thai is amazing! I imagine the rest of the menu is as good but I don't know if I can bring myself to order anything different. The medium is probably as hot as I can go definitely hotter than other places just so you know before you order. The flavor is amazing! Definitely check this place out!,2
"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great atmosphere, the fish tank at the center of the restaurant is really cool.waitstaff and managers were extremely friendly.only waited 5 minutes for a table with no reservatfion on saturday night last week.drinks were delish! had their top shelf mojito YUM and my friend had their special bloody mary and loved it.menu was unique.we went with the soup trio clam chowder pretty good , lobster bisque very good and gazpacho amazing ! I had the short ribs and scallops for dinner and was really good as well.the short ribs did have a burnt kind of taste but was still good.and the scallops were soooo good.i'd def go back again!",2
"The food here is always awesome.however, the last three times we have been here including today the service was absolutely awful! We got our food before our drinks.the meal was an hour and a half and most of it was waiting on the waitress to bring drinks food etc.a shame really",1
"This is a true first class experience that being said, you are paying for first class! . The entrance looks like an upscale bar, the bathrooms are gorgeous, the theaters offer plush, reclining chairs complete with a pillow throw blanket for each guest .you might have to pick between watching the film and taking a nap. nThe food drinks are pretty good, not outstanding. Popcorn is included in the ticket price. nAll in all, if there's a film that you're really excited to see and you want to splurge on an upscale night out, iPic definitely delivers!",2
"In love with the Chai currently.hot, iced, whatever, just give me a Hava Java Chai! Speed of service is great. Baristas are friendly and easy going.",2
"The food was okay. The pork ribs tasted like they were sitting around for a while. The steak and burgers were good. I love their chips and salsa. They have these video devices on every table. You can buy games for .99 each, great for kids if you don't want to teach them to interact with those you are dining with. You can swipe through the menu on this device but there were four of us so we used the actual menus given us. You can also pay for your bill with this device which is convenient. The hostess explained all this to us. We wanted this thing off our table and the hostess said we had have it on the table. What?! I removed it and then she said, oh I guess you don't want this but we really don't have any other place for it. Well the shelf behind us worked just fine. The floor would have been my next option. When it came time to pay the bill we computed the tip in our heads, 20 but the device gave us a different amount for 20 , a dollar and change more. I took out my handy dandy phone calculator and yes our figure was correct and not the device. Why I have no idea. Maybe they want you to tip the tax. Chili's stick to better food and stop trying to make a few extra dollars on these gimmicks. We probably won't consider Chili's the next time we want to dine out. Not with all the other places we can go.",1
I was doubtful that they could match the paint on my wheel but I was wrong. Not only did the make it look new again but I was in and out in about an hour.,2
"Amazing service! We've been having this vibrating noise in the garage for some time now every time we turned ion the hot water or flushed the toilet. After researching online, it was recommended that we flush our water heater and have a plumber do an inspection. I called at 2 00AM and at 7 30am, they called to confirm a time. Trevor came around 9am. He is so friendly and have a great personality. He flushed the water heater and provided basic maintenance. He answered all of our questions patiently. No more noise! It is such a breath of fresh air to have a service company whose priority is our satisfaction. I definitely will be using them again. Thank you Pure Plumbing.",2
"The reviews are kind of all over the place, so not sure what to gather except for our own experiences. This is a usual place we hit up when in town. But creatures of habit as we are, we always stick to the same dishes. can't miss right. And they're always excellent. n nSpicy Scezchuan beef soup. it's got some serious kick but so flavorful. Yes spicy, but with the proper ratio of flavors. n nPai Goo noodles, which is basically a pork chop with noodles. Simple, tasty, and very fresh. n nSpicy cucumbers. accompaniment of some fresh veggies. n nCongee. all very tasty. Again, comfort food with great flavors. n nAll the above tend to be on the somewhat lighter, brothy side. Would love to try some of the other dishes, like any of the fried noodles. And yes, as the name implies why wouldn't i? Well, bc it's all pretty damn greasy and as tasty as that may sound, and as much as i like not having to put on any lip gloss, it's just all way too heavy. And i think that's where some of the negative reviews might come in. n nService was solid, not 5 star Fancy LV restaurant, but yunno, it's a 13 bowl of noodle level of service. n nIt is however, clean. And fast. Fresh. Tasty. So, basically, it's what most of us want in a good chinese restaurant that is unbelievably difficult to find. Very affordable, fresh, tasty, comfort food, in a clean setting. Trust me, that ain't easy when it comes to Chinese food.",2
"After moving into our first home, my husband and I all of a sudden had a lot more need for stores like the Home Depot, Lowe's, and Ace than we ever did living in apartments. Even though we painted a few of the apartments we lived in, we never had to consider things like which air conditioning filters to buy, how to select the right length of extender for light fixtures, and which window coverings to buy. Having always seen commercials for the Home Depot and Lowe's that promise the customer how helpful their staff will buy in making these important and unfamiliar decisions you know, ""we can do it, you can help "" and ""let's build something together "" , I guess we expected a staff that was a lot more proactive and helpful than the one we've encountered at this Lowe's. This Lowe's staff is definitely more helpful than the staff at the Home Depot in Laveen and their prices are more competitive, but we've been disappointed with how difficult it has been to get a staff member to help us they definitely don't find you you have to find them! and to get questions answered. Every time my husband and I have gone in to select a product, we have found the staff to be somewhat absent we have to had to track down someone to help us and not all that knowledgeable about the difference between various products or the accessories add ons we needed for certain purchases. n nI wouldn't recommend anyone against visiting this location of Lowe's, especially since their prices and selection are decent. However, I would advise new homeowners or those taking on big home improvement processes to do their homework online and with crafty friends or neighbors before coming in to shop because the bubbly, super knowledgeable staff from the commercials appear to not actually exist in the real stores!",2
"This is a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service. n nI ordered the calamari based on the reviews. It was good, but nothing special. I agree with some other reviewers that it was under seasoned. n nThe lobster ravioli was very tasty. The sauce was delicious. n nThe bananas foster did not disappoint. It was the definite highlight of the meal. n nI would not go out of my way to go to this restaurant while in Vegas, but I had a wonderful dining experience here.",2
"Stopped here to pick up some baked goods while waiting for a seat at Zada Jane's. A friend who was visiting wanted to stop. I thought that for a bakery, they had kind of slim pickings, but then again I had just gone to Amelie's the day before and gotten my socks knocked off. I wasn't at all impressed with their selection of sweet bakery items. It looked like they could have an impressive bread selection, but most of the compartments were vacant. n nMy friend ended up getting an iced latte, which was nothing to write home about. We ended up getting a cannoli and baklava. The baklava didn't disappoint, though I'm not a huge fan. n nFor the person who said they'd go back for the cannoli, though. don't. One reason I love cannoli's is that they're a savory item. The ricotta filling isn't too sweet, it's just right for those people who like flavor over sugar. This cannoli was so loaded with sugar that I felt like I was eating a donut. I was extremely disappointed it's hard to screw up a cannoli, but it happened. n nThe one saving grace on the way in, they had free samples set up for a new olive tapenade they were selling. I'm not sure if it was one they made, but it definitely did look like it was made and packaged there. It was definitely the most delicious and flavorful tapenade that I can remember eating, and they put out just the right kind of bread with it. It was beautiful. And that tapenade added another star to this review.",1
Love this place. So many options of food to choose from. Everything kept pretty clean and staff restock food when it gets low. Different seasonings to add flavor to your food. Cayenne pepper is my favorite. 3 different size bowls to choose from so if u aren't too hungry you can get the right amount and not pay too much. One of those places you have to try out.,2
"I came here November 2011 during Thanksgiving Week. The line was insanely long, but the experience was made better by a girl who was with her boyfriend and was constantly checking me out nThe food choices are not very vast, they are small by comparison to other buffets. nThe lighting is quite dim overall in the main area. nThe one thing I enjoyed was the Mac and Brie Cheese with bits of bacon. Other than that I didn't really enjoy their offerings. nBecause I stuffed myself with the mac and cheese, I didn't leave room for dessert, but seeing as how they are a french place, you would think the offerings would be more exotic.",1
"Not bad! On a 4 day business trip to Waterloo Kitchener I ate here twice. It's definitely decent sushi and since I'm from the Bay Area in California, I feel this statement has twice as much weight as someone who is from a landlocked part of the country. n nNiko Niko has a lot of selection, from sashimi and tempura to some pretty crazy rolls. Each day of the week a roll will be on sale so check the board behind the sushi counter to see what's discounted. Dishes will typically come with a salad loved the dressing and miso soup. The rolls are pretty hefty I was full eating two of them and one plus an appetizer might be better. It's around 9 12 for each. n nCame here on a weekday and there was no line and service was quite prompt so it wasn't very crowded. I'd recommend stopping by if you're in the area and looking for a solid meal.",2
"On a recent trip to Vegas, we got roped into the timeshare scam by Grandview Resorts. n nWe were approached on the strip by a blonde lady named Robin and offered two pairs of free show tickets plus a free buffet breakfast if we could suffer through an hour presentation after. We were told the hotel we'd be touring was just down the strip from where we were staying at Excalibur so we figured, knowing it would be sales pitch that we wouldn't take, two hours of our time was worth two free pairs of tickets. I really wanted to see a show while on vacation. n nUm no. All lies. n nWe boarded a charter bus from our hotel on the strip with a bunch of other suckers around 10 am. We drove for 30 minutes on the freeway. Got off the bus and were ushered into the lobby of some hotel in the middle of nowhere. Upon arrival, there was no food as promised. The saleswoman on the strip had insisted that we don't eat before we go so we were totally hangry at this point and annoyed that the hotel was so much further than we were told. n nWe waited in the lobby until 11 am. Some salesman retrieves us and has us get in another car to travel to yet another property 10 minutes away where we were told the food would be. We're about an hour in at this point. n nIn the car, we told the salesman that we were told the hotel would be on the strip. ""This is the strip, "" he replied. ""Technically, we're on Las Vegas Blvd still and this will all be connected by 2020. "" Seriously, dude? n nThat's when we asked to be taken back to the hotel and given our money back. We wasted 2 hours of our day. Got no free show tickets, no food and had to argue to get our money back. n nDon't fall for the scam! The 2 3 hours does not include travel time. It's more like 4 5. The hotel is not down the strip at all. They'll tell you anything to get you there. It's quite far from the strip and in the middle of nowhere. n nThere are plenty of ways to find discounts in Vegas on shows and other fun. You don't need to attend this scam for free tickets. Totally not worth it. n nPS The salesman said we could complain, but warned us that this was such a successful pitch that the company would not care about two people complaining. Comforting. n nShame on you, Grandview!",1
"Sadly, I think this place is suffering from ""I don't know what I want to be "" itis. In the past, we've gone for the happy reverse happy hour and had great experiences. But, Saturday, unfortunately, it was just not good at all. It was 9 45 PM, on a Friday, but since they didn't close until 11 I figured we were ok. The only empty table that was clean was at the sushi bar which looked nice due to the enormous fish tank. Sadly, that's when the nice part of the evening ended. n nImmediately after sitting down, one of the sushi chefs started breaking down cleaning the entire bar whist mean mugging us and the rest of the patrons. I then realized I couldn't even hear myself think. Between the sauced people in the lounge, to the house music blaring overhead, I thought, for a moment, I was stuck in an over priced lounge in Vegas. n nOur waiter, who I'm pretty sure was an extra on the Jersey Shore, took our order and it only took twelve minutes to deliver the drinks. Then, two of the three sushi rolls that were ordered made it to us, along with completely un seasoned sliders and greasier than it should've been flatbread. n nA manager noticed my sad face and asked what was wrong, after explaining it to him I think he heard me he came back with 6 taken off the tab for the grease. It was a nice attempt at saving face, but not enough to right the sour note. Alas, KG, we will not be back.",1
"So based on the previous reviews alone I sought this location out. Luckily it was just a 10 min walk from my room in another hotel to get there. n nI gave it a 4 because I was not a happy camper when after 5 mins of tying to figure out what I wanted they were out of Roast Beef! Seriously? A deli out of roast beef? Put up a sign or something next time please. So after that everything else just seemed lack luster and I went with Turkey on sourdough. n nIt was piled high and the bread was substantial enough to hold it together with out fallout out all over the place. They have a large selection of sandwiches, salads and even the famous Black and White cookie. n nI will definitely return on my next Vegas adventure. Sandwich is big enough to share of you're just looking for a quick sharable mid afternoon snack.",2
Hugo was great food was pretty yummy,2
I have no idea why I even went here more than once. I've only tried their espresso drinks and they're of very poor quality. It's weak and inconsistent and overpriced. Would not recommend and would not go back. There's an abundance of better cafes to go to in this area.,1
"My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub par we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey.",1
"the bf and i stayed here over this past weekend for the life is beautiful festival in downtown vegas. we wanted to be close to the strip but away from the craziness when we wanted to be. it was perfect. the valet attendants were quick and great, along with the bell hop we got. check in was fast but i felt the front desk attendants could have been more personable. the young lady checking us in was just eh and looked like she wanted her shift to end, asap. n nwe stayed in one of the rooms in the ivory tower. we contemplated on upgrading the room to a suite but it was quite spacious and had the amenities we were looking for. my only complaint would be that housekeeping took almost two hours to provide additional toiletries. so not the bizzness when you're trying to shower and can't due to your bf selfishly killing the small bottles of shampoo and conditioner! other than that incident all went smoothly. we also left both of our room keys due to rushing out of the room saturday afternoon to head to dt. when we arrived back to the room, he called the front desk and a very kind security guard came up to open the door for us. of course, after checking our ids. he was such the opposite of most security bouncers i encounter. very personable and even thanked us for the change of duty, even if it was just to open our doors. n nmegan from concierge was very helpful getting us a town car to the festival and walked with us to show us the vehicle. such great customer service. n nthe bf made daily trips three days to earl of sandwich to satisfy his cravings. the nearest one near us is in downtown disney so that's been impossible. he smiled from ear to ear because of this. we also ate at the 24 7 cafe. the food is typical for your twenty four hour diner cafe. the servers were all very nice and attentive. n nwe will def stay here again but most likely get an ivory suite room or even stay at palms place and perhaps eat at their steakhouse cause this girl is all about a great steak and turf and hopefully be able to check out the bars and clubs as i once went to in my young twenties.",2
"Dont do their Chinese NY dim sum brunch poor quality especially for the price. We went to Wing Lei but their CNY brunch doesn't start till tomorrow, decided to try Jasmine instead because they were open, and we regretted it. n nSame price as Wing Lei 58.88 8 is a lucky number but less choice of dim sum and taste was really mediocre. Also didn't like that they didn't have carts it really was just a straight buffet. They had large quantities of everything in steamers, so obviously it was all sitting for a while. Even at noon on a Sunday it was only 3 4 full, and an empty buffet always means old food. n nI'm not going to bother going into detail of what they had because none of it was memorable. Best thing they had was this mango coconut pudding dessert. n nService wasn't friendly and we had to track them down when we needed something. Unlike Wing Lei the tea wasn't included extra 8 charge. n nThis would be a 1 star review if it wasn't for the amazing view of the fountain. That really was it's only saving grace. Oh and I liked the high quality linens. n nSo if you're craving a high quality class dim sum experience, try Wing Lei exact same price but so much better in every way. Jasmine was a huge waste of time and money.",1
"As suggested, we tried the Cal Italia. It truly was worth all the recommendations. Absolutely loved the pizza and the appetizer meatballs were the perfect compliment. Cool atmosphere, great location downtown, accommodating service and food very much worth coming back for. Which we will be doing soon!",2
"So many things to like about Rebel. I can't give it 5 stars because of the smoke. It's too much to ask to drink my Lagunitas Born Yesterday without secondhand smoking a dozen cigs but such is life. n nThe things they do have going for them though, are going splendidly. They have a great selection of taps and they usually have something new to try when I pop in. If they blow a keg of your favorite brew, never fear, chances are they have something equally good to replace it with. n nI'm not a huge fan of bar food so there aren't a ton of options here for me to chose from. I eat the fries. As far as french fries go, these are decent. They're fat steak fries not the annoying shoestring version. The fish tacos are a good option too but they aren't listed on the menu so I'm not sure if the tacos are there to stay. n nThe bartenders a few of them at least recognize me, which I like. They know what I drink and greet me with a sample if they have something new on tap they think I might enjoy. Cool. Go for the beer, stay cause the people pouring it are pretty cool.",2
"This museum is located just about a mile away from Fremont Street in Old Town Vegas. I say it is definitely worth the visit, just try to keep your doors locked as you definitely pass through an interesting part of town. n nWe called ahead to get the low down on how this worked, and it seems like you always have to do a guided tour, not a place you just show up and walk around. The tour runs every 30 minutes and lasts about an hour. Day tours are 18 students get discounts and night tours are 25 I believe only about 5 of the displays actually light up though . n nThe tour guides you through their ""boneyard "" and gives you lots of history of the signs and Vegas back in the day. It was extremely informative and our guide was quirky and fun. For us, on a Sunday after Vegas and the afternoon warming temperatures, the tour was a bit long and we really just wanted to see the signs. I recommend picking an early time so the sun isn't too hot on you as there is really zero shade the whole tour. n nCheck it out and get some fun pics while you learn a bit of Vegas history.",2
WOW this place is amazing! Some of the best Italian pastries I've had south of Philadelphia. The cannolis and baklava are amazing and the staff was very friendly and made excellent suggestions. I wish they had a store in south Charlotte HINT HINT.,2
Fun place! Live DJ playing music but not too loud to talk. Large and varied selection of in house brewed beers. We tried several and all were interesting. Food menu was small but tasty. Probably not the best place for dinner but a great place for drinks.,2
"Hot N Juicy is an experience as much as it is a delicious dining destination. Where else can you don bibs and suck away on crab legs, shrimp and clams doused in ""hot n juicy "" chili sauce or garlic butter or lemon pepper, depending on your preference that arrive in plastic bags? n nEvery table has two paper towel rolls, 'cuz this restaurant knows it's gonna get messy. I couldn't take any photos because they would've come out looking nasty. But looks are deceiving! n nThe sauces are heavenly. I suggest you try all of them. Wash the seafood down with mozzarella sticks and cajun fries or sweet potato fries, if that's your thing . Trust me on this. n nHaven't been to Boiling Crab so can't make a comparison in that regard, but I was very, very happy with Hot N Juicy!",2
"Very disappointed. n nFor as much as my group was paying for staying in multiple rooms, we expected a lot better. I have never stayed in a room that required so much maintenance and additional service because a lot of stuff was missing. There were so many problems ranging from clogged sinks to broken refrigerator handles to no kitchen utensils to missing seat cushions. Even when the hotel solved all these problems, they would half ass certain aspects of the service not cleaning up the sinks, replacing only one of two the seat cushions, etc . The service was disorganized and there seamed to be a disconnect with the hotel staff. For a hotel as new as Cosmo, there should not have been as many problems as we encountered. n nAt the very least, we had a great view from the balcony, the room decor was nice, and the casino bars were nice. Marquee is also very enjoyable. If it was not for everything outside of the room, this review would be worse. n nCosmo is nice to go through or party at, but definitely do not stay there.",1
"We were really looking forward to some good Irish grub, unfortunately, it didn't happen here. The Shepherd's Pie ""gravy "" was watery and tasteless, and there wasn't much meat. The irish stew was cold and and bland. The wait staff was nice, but service was lacking. Everything took a long time, and the most disappointing was dessert. Though the bread pudding was good, we asked for ice cream on it, and the waitress waited too long to bring it to our table so the ice cream was almost completely melted. Won't be returning.",1
"It was a dark and gloomy Sunday night in downtown Phoenix. It was 6 30 Pm. On any other day in this city the streets would be lit up with restaurants eagerly proclaiming ""we're open! we're open! come on in! give us your money! "" n nBut not on Sundays. On Sundays everyone closes their doors and goes home. As invisible as magic, unicorns, and Mariah Carey's acting talent. n nIt was Nathan's birthday, and Amanda B and I took it upon ourselves to devise a place suitable for a birthday dinner. You might as well have asked us to perform brain surgery with a screwdriver and a plunger. n n ""Two Hippies? "" n ""Closed. "" n ""That BBQ place you like? "" n ""Closed. "" n ""Um.there's a Pizza Hut "" n ""Uh, no. "" n ""Sorry. "" n nYeah. Guess which one I was in that exchange. n nFinally we came upon Mamma Mia's, and collectively griped at how we had forgotten our ""freebie "" chips from the Birthday pARTy. Thankfully, they were open, though you wouldn't have known it by the way the girl ushered us through the kitchen to the dining room. n nThere are two types of people who order pizza. There are those who, when asked their preference, list all the toppings they like. And there are those who respond by listing all the things they don't like on pizza. With the latter option, everyone gathers around the menu and lists off what available toppings they wouldn't eat. Through the process of elimination, you pick from the available toppings and come with a democratically agreed upon pie. n nAnd that's how we decided on basil and fresh tomato slices. With a side order of meatballs. n n ""How many meatballs come in a side? "" asked Nathan. n ""Five. "" n ""That's perfect. "" n nAt first I was skeptical. How is five perfect for a party of three people? Who taught you to do math, birthday boy? Big Brother? n nThankfully I kept those thoughts to myself.I know, even I was impressed with myself. n nAnd I'm glad I did, because the meatballs were big, saucy and spoonable, since our party of three only managed to get two sets of plastic silverware. I guess it's not just Nathan who's math is a little fubar'd. n nThe pizza was rather superb. So superb that, even armed with only basil and tomatoes, it was enough to satiate a palette accustomed to deep dish pepperoni sausage with buffalo sauce and buffet breadsticks. n nThis was like re education for my taste buds, but without the hard labor and Chinese man screaming in my face about how awesome communism is. n nThe question about whether my hair was real or not aside, the staff were accommodating and friendly. n nIf I ever find myself lost in the dark and lonely place that is downtown Phoenix on a Sunday after 6pm, I will definitely keep Mamma Mia's in mind. And I will remember my ""freebie "" chips. n nDear Phoenix, n nThis isn't Salt Lake City. Cut this Sunday nonsense out. n nLove, nMe",2
Amazing place with the best customer service!yumyyyy so yummyy love your cakes very much!,2
"If you like pizza, do not order one from Benvenuto's. Concepts of the dishes are simple and appetizing in theory, just wish they could execute. Poorly made food and too expensive. You could do just about as good at Rocky Rococo's to be honest. Big thumbs down from me.",1
"Worst place EVER n nWe had 3 guys 5 ladies. The bouncer took all of our girls. n nWe had those stupid passes, but the bouncer held everyone in line after 12AM after the passes weren't valid anymore. It was 40 bucks to get in. n nWe waited in line for 3 HOURS, all guys in line. After waiting at the front of the line for about an hour, they let us in. We were already too pissed. Our girls had already gotten drunk and were ready to go home so we just left. The girls told us that it was mostly women and old guys inside. n nI would suggest coming with a large group of girls over guys and don't let the bouncer take the girls away. n nI'm not coming back here again.",1
"I live in what might possibly be one of the finest cities for sushi in the US.yep, Los Angeles Feel free to argue or debate this point with me and then tell me where to go, cuz I am a sushi ho! . n nSpecifically, I live in Studio City the home of sushi row, the land of sashimi wonderment and the prime pallate real estate that holds faves like Asanebo, Nozawa and Iroha.

I thoroughly enjoyed the tasty treats we had here last night and I would definitely come back if I lived here. n nI really liked the hamachi with jalapeno. It was a little light on the ginger sauce, but still very good. We also tried the tuna carpaccio that mixed walnuts with it. Very different and very good. We also tried one of the featured scallop specials that was good, but a little too heavy on the scallions for my taste. I wanna taste the scallops and they got a little lost in the onion madness. We also tried the shishito peppers, good, but a really small portion and the eggplant. Oh and I can't forget to mention the miso marinated black cod. Very deelish. n nDefinitely check it out. The atmosphere is nice and charming, the service is attentive and helpful and they serve a nice Pinot Grigio to boot. Good times ",2

"Bad experience with this office. Only one staff member that I encountered was helpful and friendly and that was the lady from Chicago at the front desk when I checked in. The doctor's assistant Dr. Brill is the worst MA I have ever encountered in a doc's office. She will not listen and gets everything wrong causing headaches trying to straighten things out. n nWent for a pap and am told that it needs to be redone 2 weeks later their fault. Also when I requested insurance approval for a med that the doc prescribed, this MA refused to do the paperwork and two weeks later I still cannot get the prescription filled. My insurance company had to fax paperwork twice for med approval and she still refuses. She will not listen to what needs to be done and when it is explained to her, she does not hear it, but cries out that people are yelling at her. A real problem. When I tried to straighten it out, I spoke with someone in the office that told me she would have the office manager return my call. Never did. Really bad customer service. n nNeedless to say I am looking for a new gyn. Don't go here unless you are desperate.",1
"I had heard about Chino Bandido and knew that Guy Fieri had it on ""Triple D "" as a must go to place so when an out of town coworker asked where's a good place to go for lunch, how could I resist trying this place? So many people I know either want Chinese or Mexican for lunch, this is the best fusion of both worlds. n nI LOVE spicy food! For me, the hotter the better. If I can still speak and breathe and my eyes aren't watering, I don't see how they can really call it ""spicy. "" n nThis being said, I went straight for the SUICIDE PLATTER! I was NOT disappointed! I had the Jerk Chicken, Pollo Diablo with Cuban style hot black beans, and Jerk fried rice. They provided a warm snickerdoodle cookie for dessert. swoon n nThe chicken dishes were all so nice and juicy and yes they definitely activated the heat seeker in me. As for the Cuban style hot black beans, they brought on flashbacks of how my Aunt from Cuba used to make them when I was a kid and lived near her. Wish I had the recipe but they unfortunately declined so I'll be hitting up my Aunt for her recipe. n nWhen friends, coworkers and relatives are in town I always tell them to go to Chino Bandido and downright beg to go with them! n nThe only reason this isn't five stars may sound silly to most people, but it is the portion size. It is just way too much food for me. Seriously. n nBy all means, DO SAMPLE THE DIFFERENT FOODS. Find what you like and piece together your own combination ""Takee Outee "" taken straight off the menu, they said it even though most eat right there. n nYes, it is extremely busy. That's a good sign! n nIf I hadn't been going straight for the Suicide Platter because I wanted to see just how hot spicy their food truly was without sacrificing taste or tastebuds , I would have gotten one of many other tasty dishes I sampled. n nThe Jade Red Pork was delicious, as was the Emerald Chicken which was so tender it practically melted in my mouth. I sampled the Carnitas, Chile Relleno, Hengrenade Chicken too and all were wonderful. Machaca.yummy! n nFor me, it is a bit of a drive but well worth the trip!

"I went to M.C.N salon because I had seen positive reviews on Yelp. I have to say the reviews were right. It was one of the best salon experiences I've ever had. The salon itself is beautiful and very inviting. The receptionist was so warm and genuinely friendly. I recently changed stylists for something new which I was wary of doing. I decided to try one of their junior stylists, Elizabeth. Everyone should go to see her! She gives a great first impression which is reassuring because nothing makes me more nervous than a stylist who is not put together or whose haircut and or color is whack. n n I came in a hot mess and I left feeling and looking a 100 better. My hair is really thick and was driving me crazy in the heat. She did a great job thinning it out and giving me layers without sacrificing length. My head literally felt lighter.

I would recommend her to anyone. She's really professional and great at her job!",2
"Food is good. Portion sizes are on the smaller side. I'd grant more stars if it weren't for the poor service. What I'm about to describe has happened to me numerous times here, and I've witnessed it happen to countless others as well. people who order well after I do often get served way ahead of me. My order is generally for one person, max of two people, and the item s ordered are always simple not to mention, sometimes, exactly the same as what others behind me end up ordering. And yet they get served first. This happens all the time here. n nWill likely not return.unless I see an ""under new management "" sign.",1
"My husband and I recently went to a few consignment stores in the area. The prices don't bother me as I like high end stuff like Robb and Stucky and Thomasville. The positives are they have nice quality things for the most part and it is nicely laid out. They also did initially call to ask if we were satisfied with the products. However, the negatives far out weigh the positives. The staff is rude and they use very high pressure sales. When we brought up some problems for example they left only one stool out front and the other two in the back and wouldn't let us view them all together . When we brought them home they didn't even match. Also, their stuff is overpriced and when we explained we were frustrated and how I had a agreed with other yelp comments, I was told that the people on yelp were just all cheap. Well, we also went to air park consignment, lost and found, etc. Though they are all quite different in price and quality, some are even better quality and I didn't mind spending a couple thousand dollars on a piece as long as it was good quality, going to last, and I was not being taken advantage of. Definitely didn't feel that way at dash! Again, the staff was pushy, rude, and I didn't feel they were entirely honest about pricing. Would not return, though the philosophy of a consignment, as well as the price is well worth the visit to some of the other stores in the air park where the staff is also quite lovely!",1
We love to come here everytime we are in Vegas. My favorite entree are the tacos. I love the spices they use. Plus I like the decor and open air vibe and lighting. They play a mix of music as well. I tried the shrimp ceviche appetizer this time which was just ok. The top shelf margaritas are yummy. nI did come for Sunday brunch once and I do recommend it. They have mariachis during the brunch.,2
The idea of a club based on a cheesey movie. I have no idea why I had to check this place out. Probably because I was drunk.,1
Shopping carts throughout the parking lot and in spaces where you want to park your car. It's after 800 am and the garden area is not open yet. I don't get that. Areas in garden are blocked off for an operating fork lift so I can't pick up garden plants. Then I pay for my items and the only open registers are by the commercial area and this exit is at the opposite end of the main entrance. Dislike.,1
I have been to a lot of Starbucks locations here in town as well as my wife has to but this location stands out pretty well as far as service goes they remember our names and our drinks almost every time the wait time isn't that bad considering how busy they are! Great job !,2

Some eating places even close at 2 30 pm, like The Good Egg First Watch. They wouldn't DARE close that early in LA because they would lose a lot of profit! .I am from LA .",1
"This was, by far, the worst meal we had while in Las Vegas.especially disappointing since it was also, by far, the most expensive meal we had while in Las Vegas. n nWe just had a little time for dinner before a show, and the concierge suggested this place since we had no reservations. It was horridly overpriced, and the food mediocre at best. n nThe service was, however, outstanding.sorta. They brought a piece of bread before the meal, and never offered another, until we chased the server down and asked. Not cool. n nWe split the grilled octopus appetizer. The octopus was cooked perfectly, but sauced with an extremely strong balsamic glaze that completely obscured the flavor of the fish. We both ordered the short rib with polenta dinners. The meat was overcooked to the point that it became mush as soon as we started to chew it. The polenta was excellent.both tablespoons of it. The ""dinner "" portion would have been an appetizer anywhere else. This meal was thoroughly disappointing, especially at 36 a pop. n nThe wine, at 22 a glass, was no better than the wine they bring for free if you just stick a dollar bill in the penny slots. n nMario, if you're paying attention You can do a lot better than this!",1
"My new burger stop. My wife has picked me up some burgers from there previously a few times. Wow. They are delicious! Swung by the other day after work to get gas, and to my surprise they were still open. Walked in and was greeted by the guy who was running it. He recognized my wife right away and already knew her burger order. I wasn't sure what I wanted, so he suggested the cheesesteak. Good choice! Better than Pat's or Geno's in Philly! Also got an order of fries. They are cut from fresh potatoes, not the frozen kind. And they use Heinz ketchup, the only brand that should be legal to use. I definitely recommend this place. Good food, good service, and it certainly hits the spot! Try this place out!",2
"My husband first went to Elite Eye Care 2 years ago, it took 7 weeks and 4 different try's to get his glasses right. We thought well may be this was just a one time issue.

"Definitely worth trying out when you're in Vegas. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Like everyone else says, SHARE! It was only one of my girls and me going at the plate and we barely made a dent. Its super carby but such a guilty satisfaction. Also if you're a fan of bloody mary's, do try the BLT Mary.

"Buzio's was just okay. I went there as a treat from my friend who dislikes seafood but indulged me anyway. He got a Groupon. Without it, this place it's definitely not worth it. n nTo me the concept of the whole place was just off. Everything in a restaurant tells a story glasses, flatware, decor, menu, pricing, etc. All of these pieces just did not add up. For example, my water in a water goblet, but my waiter was wearing a denim looking shirt with a big fish embroidered on the back and a casino esque nametag. The prices here are in the same range as Maestro's Ocean Club, which is insane for the service of the staff and execution by the chef. It feels like the restaurant is lost and doesn't know who it is other than they want to charge a lot of money for a lack of quality to try to increase profit margins. n nWhen we got there, I had to tell them I had reservation because I was never asked. We were seated. No polite conversation on the way to the table. I could tell that this place was about the bare minimum of service. Immediately, I thought the place reminded me of a Red Lobster that was taking itself very seriously.The waiter came and was polite and friendly. He took our drink order and left. He came back and asked if we had questions about the menu. I asked a few then decided on the lobster pasta honestly because the 2 sides that the meal came with seemed so small . My host ordered the chicken with mushrooms and mashed potatoes. I had a cup of the lobster bisque to start. It was good, but there were not any pieces of lobster in it. I know that it's not standard, but it would have been a nice touch. The bread was good. It wasn't amazing or terribly fresh, but it wasn't old or stale either. Our empty plates and bread basket sat for at least fifteen minutes before he thought to clear them. n nWhen he did, the main course came out. My lobster pasta was good. I've tasted more truffle oil on my fries at Yardhouse, but at least it wasn't overpowering. It just wasn't very seasoned at all. I will give them credit for basically putting an entire lobster tail in the pasta. On some of the bigger pieces, the lobster wasn't cooked all the way through. The chicken was good. It was moist, but the sides were incorrect. Even when we told the waiter that we didn't order carrots but mushrooms instead, he just said okay and never brought out the mushrooms. I asked my host if he wanted me to get the mushrooms for him, he told me not to worry about it. We were asked if we wanted desert, but we declined and decided to go elsewhere for dessert. n nOur check came with automatic gratuity of 18 added in. We were a party of two. I don't remember seeing that posted anywhere, but I didn't say anything. When the waiter brought back our change, I counted it, but it was incorrect. It was an error in our favor. Normally, I would say something, but they added in gratuity and certainly more than what was deserved with the incorrect orders and lack of basic service. The waiter looked at us because we didn't tip. My guess is that many people aren't reading their check. n nOverall, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. The seafood wasn't all that fresh. The service was subpar. Auto gratuity on a party of two is ridiculous. Three strikes and you're out, Buzio's. Sorry.",1
"Buffet Mass quantities of low quality food. n nI came here for the daily deal, 30 for all you can eat, all day, all the time until 10pm. Meaning you can come back as many times as you want. n nAs usual the food quality was below standard, typical of most buffets. The only reason to go would be for the great deal 30 all day eats , it is 25 for all day eats during the week too!",1
"Love this place. Always clean, fast service, and ample seating. Not a fan of the taco salad but the burritos and enchiladas I've had have been excellent!",2
"The nerdy girl in the glasses that kept leaning over showing her ass crack to the entire bar was completely rude and ruined my experience. n nAlso, it's cool that all your friends from the Scottsdale Whole Foods came down for a beer, but stop chatting and get me my damn beer, I mean there were only 20 of you behind a tiny bar. n nVery upsetting considering I love the Chandler bar.",1

"We gave it a try. honestly we did. Went in for appetizers and drinks during the middle of the day once, then came back for pizzas for lunch, and finally even gave a full out dinner a shot this week. I'm sorry to say, but Francesca's just simply isn't that good. n nSo, here are the obligatory nice things to say nice people, casual atmosphere yet in a nice refined interior, and a bar area that could even persuade me to drop in for a drink or two while downtown. n nNow, why it's just not a place I'll give a fourth try to n Busboys. in an momentary lapse of judgment, and or 'different way to run a restaurant,' there are what seem to be 2 or 3 busboys for every table, and they must have a bet going, and or are paid on commission of how little time someone can finish a meal before they grab the dish away from them. Honestly, by the third time we were visiting, it became humorous. n Pizza. the pizza crust, it's just bad. I was hoping to have some hand crafted brick oven tasty goodness, but alas it is bland, hard to chew, and seems to be mass produced. This is a big miss, especially since they have a pizza special for their lunches and are supposed to be a 'trattoria' with 'simple, rustic cooking' per their website . n Pasta. in the ravioli di funghi mushroom ravioli that I had, one could taste the treated water in which it was either prepared or cooked. And if that chlorinated taste wasn't the water, then I really don't want to think about. On the upside. the sauce was okay. n Noise. on the first visit, we had the 'rents in town, and the first thing that they commented was, ""This place is going to be loud. "" Hypothesis true. Dinner on a Friday night is not a place for conversation. n nI could say more, but those are the main points that begin to stand out. and once they start to get to you, the rest of it just simply falls apart. So, I hate to say it, because I wanted to like it, but Madison has too many great restaurants to spend an evening at Francesca's.",1
I've been going to this location for about a year now. It's not a fancy resort but it's a great place to get a nice relaxing massage. I've never had a problem with the people there or waiting and they've always been nice and friendly. nIf you are not a member you will get the sales push and of course they wait until after your massage when you are feeling REALLY good. But I did join and I don't regret it. nI get my massages with Ashley and I really like her. I don't like to talk during my session because I just want to enjoy it and Ashley complies. I feel very comfortable there. I do agree that they seem to be pretty busy but as long as I call ahead and make an appointment it hasn't been an issue. nOh and they have extended their hours and are open pretty late in the evening which is really awesome. Call for hours I don't think the ones listed here are current.,2
"I've tried this place over the last couple of years. And, having moved within about a minute of the place was hoping that my last couple of visits would be improved upon but. to no avail. n nThis place still suffers from lack of real professional food management in several areas. The food still ranks a 3 4 on the 1 10 yummie scale. The drinks are about 3 alcohol and 97 mix. And of course it always turns me off when you stick to the dried ""something "" on the vinyl seats or sit down to a dirty table. The staff definitely needs better training in clearing a table. n nI tried this place twice since moving down the street in hopes that it could become a new hangout. WRONG. For dinner, the Mai Tai was literally 99 pineapple juice and maybe, MAYBE they sat it next to the rum for a minute but beyond that. not a well made drink. Probably made it a ""virgin "" for a 9 year old or something. n nThe fish and chips were miserable. The batter on the fish was not light and crispy but spongy and burned tasting as if the oil was last changed for the New Year's party seven months ago. The ""chips "" were some thin product made of potatoes but were tasteless and limp from the same bad grease. n nThe waitresses we had two for some reason so one must have been in training although both seemed just as incompetent were dressed in some weird combination of bad party wear and beach rejects. Quality places should have some sort of professional dress code to maintain the overall image of the concept, not a fashion free for all even in casual places. n nI'm no snob and have eaten in 5 stars and dives from Hawaii to Maine but. i like to feel like the food was actually prepared by someone who could at least spell food and served with some fun and care. I like the food to be tasty and resemble the type of concept i'm visiting and worth the money i'm spending no matter how much. n ni might give this place one more try but the last three visits have yielded the same mediocre experiences. after all. desperate people do desperate things.",1
"Yesterday was the second time my husband and I dined here. The first time we had deli sandwiches which were very good with a canolli, which I thought was one of the best I had in town. Unfortunately, yesterday, not so good. I had ordered linguini with clam sauce and better half had spaghetti and meatballs. My linguini came to the table which was unstable with cardboard under the legs with no utensils, no garlic knots and a cup of water which was at least 85 degrees in temp with no ice. The linguini had a very yellow sauce, which to me tasted like chicken base with lots of lemon and an abundance of oregano. Not much garic and absolutely no taste of wine. Furthermore, when they brought the garlic knots out, originally the helper in the kitchen was going to slap them on our plate the from stainless steel bowl he tossed them in until the owner told him to plate them. They had very little garlic flavor, but alot of greasyness to them. My husbands spaghetti and meatballs arrived again without utensils. Spaghetti was overcooked and the meatballs were hard, dry and really did not taste very good. The plate came with two meatballs, yet the picture on their menu clearly shows 3 meatballs. A little deceiving. The facility appeared to need some attention, with the shelf items, like lady fingers, pasta and some tomato goods had dust on them and appeared neglected. As we live as far south in vegas as you can get, I can say I don't think we willl go back there again. Sorry. The only reason why I give them 2 stars is because of my previous visit.",1
Absolutely the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. I just wasted 30 of hard earned money. They also made a big mistake with my order. I ordered 2 of the combos that are supposed to come with wonton soup and rice. They delivered the principal plates instead which were more expensive and I did not get any rice or soup and when I called to let them know they refused to fix it. The Beef broccoli had a strange smell to it and the beef was grey. The poulet ananas looked like it was deep fried 2 days ago and then just reheated and it had a very small amount of sauce and burnt pinapple chunks. Would not recommend.,1
"I thought I'd save some time to stop here to get my car washed while out running errands. I have a four door, compact car used for minimal commute, so the difficulty level was easy. While they did a good job on the outside, despite missing one wheel, the inside was a disappointment. Obvious garbage was missed, even though there were litterally 3 pieces of trash. The wipe down in the front seat area was alright, but they didn't do anything in the back seat except the doors. They even missed the rear dash. The biggest failure was the vacuum job. The salesman I wouldn't call him a customer service rep because he was very pushy on upgrades although I paid 4 extra for each rug to be shampooed , said I would just have to pop the trunk and they would vacuum it. But they didn't. They didn't even close the trunk as they passed it through the wash bay, nor at the end. My four floor mat rugs turned out nicely, especially in contrast to all the dirt and particles left behind after their floor vacuum. I suppose it was my fault for being in a rush and not checking the end result, but I assumed they had someone on staff to check their work before sending it back to the customer my bad. Or maybe I should have obliged and spent the ridiculous amount for an upgrade. Well, I'm on my way to the gas station around the corner to finish vacuuming my car.",1
"Nice atmosphere. Great patio for outdoor dining. nThe most standout dish of the night was the soup. nPasta e Fasioli it was delicious. Well balanced, hearty, great flavor. nThey have a fairly large menu for a small Trattoria, and the prices are fair.",2
"Disaster! We were three. We had a 5 45 reservation but we were seated at 5 40. This was all good because we had tickets to a show and we wanted to have a nice leisurely dinner. Within 5 minutes of being seated, we ordered our meals. Within 5 minutes of ordering, we had our ice tea. So, now we're still foodless at 30 minutes past ordering our food. Now it's 40 minutes, no food. What's up, we ask our server. We have a private party in the private room and their order went in before ours. But your order should be out in 5 minutes. After 10 more minutes, still no food, we got up and left and got a less leisurely meal elsewhere prior to our show. If the restaurant had a private party coming in on a Saturday night when the place is crowded and people waiting to be seated, they should bring in additional cooks, kitchen staff, and a waiter or two. And to make matters worse, I couldn't take advantage of my P.F. Chang's gift card.",1
"Well, my wife had a hair in her shake sooo that is disgusting. Burgers were about a 3 5 and the fries were good and crisp. They gave us 3 bucks back for the shake and apologized. Overall it was too expensive, almost 30 and we could have went to Red Robin for that much. We were dissatisfied with our experience and won't be returning ",1
"This dealer has no intention of making good on discounts offered. I clearly received an email offer for 50 to be used AS CASH on ANY repair, they would not let me use it to repair my key fob which broke during normal use, just like yours will someday as they don't make them to last, they know they will break, it's a well documented problem.",1
The street tacos were delicious and we had fun sampling the different types of salsa. This food has f l a v o r. there is definitely a reason this place is busy!,2
"Yelp 100 Challenge 14' 33 100 n nMy parents had the delightful opportunity to watch Shania Twain's 'Still the One' show at Caesar's Palace last January to celebrate my mom's Nth birthday. I just got off school that night and therefore turned up a bit late and missing the first song. The ushers said we didn't miss much and guided us inside the Colosseum where guitar riffs seeped through the doors. n nWe have been Shania fans since the 90s and didn't really marvel as much at any other female country artists after she got quiet in the early 2000s. When we heard about her Vegas residency announcement, it was only a matter of time when we planned a date night together. n nThe Colosseum had a lavish intimate setting with a huge screen and lights that draped the stage, making the songs and settings spring to life. Shania still looks like a Goddess even after all these years and what she went through. I couldn't say how much of a dear she was, hopping over to the audience to give us hugs and handshakes all while she was on the mic! n nTransitions were smooth, very theatre esque and props were simple. My favorite part was the campfire scene when a real bonfire lit up in the middle of the stage. You could smell the burning wood from everywhere! Also, the moment Shania brought in her two horses made everyone's hearts leap. Country rock at its best, I tell ya add an elegant touch to that too. n nI'll try to refrain from spoiling too many details here and let you guys save the thrill for yourselves! Shania will not be staying long though so book your tickets before she ends her residency this December.",2
"Writing this review to let anyone know, if you like parking your car where you live then avoid Uptown Gardens. People park in the grass, on the curbs, everywhere because there is 0 spots. nI have spent 470 on parking tickets tow expenses in 6 months. nIf you would like to speak to a leasing manager about something, leave work early because the office closes at 5 30. nMight I add. HVAC doesn't work. n nDon't live here if you don't have to.",1
"It's really too bad, honestly, that a potentially good show, ended up getting all serious and preachy. I would have been fine with a little serious but then the whole ""support our charity "" and we give to XYZ and buy this or that in the lobby, we donate proceeds, just turned me completely off. n nAbout half way through the show Terry may I call you that? starts in on a story about a song that apparently people in Vegas wouldn't get. His agent, or the managers or whomever told him that people in Vegas are different and wouldn't go for his song. I think whomever told him this song was a bad idea, wasn't referring to the song, but referring to the whole spiel that come afterward. n nThe song wasn't terrible, sad, about a kid who has a friend who is dying of cancer and wants to know if there are horses in heaven. Okay. It's country, it pulls on the heart strings, that's all fine. But then, its the sales pitch. Buy my album, buy the song, we do donate, buy products, we give. Blah blah blah. n nHey Terry, I paid to see a show, not learn where I can make donations to your preferred charities. And yes, we now know you donate. Meanwhile, there is a good measure of God being thrown around I have no problem with God, it just seemed a little Jim Baker too me n nThis twisted the show so much, I would've walked out right there. Again, it wasn't the song that was the problem, it was the sales pitch that followed.",1
I really like staying here. Close to the MGM but yet away from all the madness. Huge affordable suites. Great for special events. Also they have independent pools from the MGM if it gets to wild there. All the buildings are connected to each other with moving walkways so you don't even have to step outside. Definitely recommend it.,2
"I actually read all of the wonderful reviews for this one and decide to go in. n nI went ahead and made appointment for my car on my day off 3 days in advance online. Seemed pretty easy. Went in 15 minutes early from my appointment, got checked in. Wasn't given a time estimate for they would be done but since I had appointment I figured it wasn't going to be very long. Boy, I was wrong. 1 1 2 hours later my car hasn't moved. Went up to the front to ask what was going on, they said they had a few cars in front of me. I asked ""Well I made a appointment online, does that count worth anything? "" He replied ""No, not really. You still have a hour wait time. "" Towards the end of this forever wait time this brunette young girl, came in and stated that she has something wrong with her car. Another employee went ahead and stated ""Sure go ahead and bring your car around back, I can look at it right now. "" My car still hasn't moved from the front of the store. I was so upset, I just left. n nBest part of all, when they had to go and look at few things in the car to get the paperwork started, the guy couldn't even figure out how to open the hood of the car. I ended up having to go outside and show them. Made me feel very uneasy. n nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone under any circumstances.",1
"We had a coupon for the Caf u00e9 Bellagio, located right off the beautiful Bellagio gardens. Our brunch plans were sidelined the Eiffel Tower restaurant as a result, I came in a little sad with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised! Plus, obviously, it was much cheaper than our original choice. n nTheir non alcoholic smoothies were DELICIOUS, and the crab eggs benedict was excellent. I really don't have any bones to pick with the meal, except for the little sliced tomato on the side. This is merely because I don't like juicy raw tomatoes, and wish that this one was oven cured when it wasn't. Otherwise, the place exceeded my expectations. Even without the coupon, the prices weren't terrible. I'd say it's a great option if you want a nice ""little "" meal to tide you over rather than an extravagant one. n nI suppose if I HAD to pick a bone, it merely lacks pizzazz or wow factor. But I don't think you go to a hotel cafe for that, even if it is the Bellagio's.",2
"This is a great place to grab a bite particularly when you can sit outside. The food would be best described, to me anyway, as an upscale bar menu. The Vegitarian and Vegan items are a nice option as my daughter is a vegitarian and it allows us to all have good food in a great atmosphere.",2
"Love this place! I've been here many many times. It's very authentic. All the servers are mexican. I like that. It seems family owned. There's no bar, just beer and wine and I think they have liquor but they make it in the back. They have nice spicy sauces. The habanero is SUPER hot, I like the tomatillo.",2
Way over priced. If ypu have a coupon watch closely. They bait and switch. Quick service,1
At first this place was paradise! Until I forgot my engagement ring in the bathroom. housekeeping straight up stole it! DOUBLE AND TRIPLE check your room before leaving to make sure you leave nothing behind! They cannot be trusted!,1
"Bagels were worthless, potatoes were tasteless, french toast cut inconsistently so half was undercooked. Veggies and bacon looked unappetizing. Bialys are glorified onion rolls. Prices are inflated scottsdale lol . Everyone's food came out at different times. Every time we asked for coffee server carried individual cup to carafe instead of bringing pot to table. Waitresses seen playing with hair. If this was NY, they'd be shut down in a week.",1
"The concept sounded really cool for me and my 12 year old son but I found this to be a complete disappointment. While we enjoyed solving the case it just seemed like it could have been so much better. The staff while nice seemed overwhelmed and understaffed. It seemed a lot of the equipment was on the blink not sure if we had bad timing or if this was a continuing problem. n nAlso, for what it is the price seemed a little high. The experience comes no where near the level of the TV show. Loved the concept but the execution failed miserably.",1
"This is a review of the Lavo Night Club ONLY. n nWe arrived at the door with passes for Lavo with our group of 17. We spoke with the door man and he told us that he could not accommodate 17 people, unless we purchased bottle service 1500 minimum .as they were letting about 20 people into the club who were not together. We asked if we broke our group up into smaller groups could we get in and and the bouncer said ""No you already said 17, so you have to get bottle service or we cannot let you in "" WTF!? Trying to force bottle service is tacky at best. What a joke. So we got out of line and wondered over to V Bar, where they were more than happy to accommodate our group without bottle service. Later I was told that Lavo was run by the same people who ran Tao Nightclub and it all made sense. both places radiate douche bag ambiance. I expected more.",1
"I will never rent from Fox again. We just rented a compact . Along with other customers who had reservations, we waited over one hour in line. Then another 15min downstairs waiting for the car. The car was fine. The wait was not. Not worth the few dollars saved at Fox.",1
"Breakfast at Autostrada today was disappointing. I ordered the mushroom omelette, and it was thin and served solo. Who eats omelettes with NO side dish? The mushrooms were delicate and delicious and the omelette overall did taste good. However, this 7 dish was pretty blan with no fruit or toast to have with it. I did order toast for an additional 1, and was SHOCKED when the bill came and the substitution for egg whites was 3. nThis place has NO atmosphere, NO Splenda or Equal for coffee or tea, and little personality. I'm not sure what the concept behind the place is, and with overpriced food served with no sides I'll pass.",1
"Went here for my birthday dinner last year. The food was great the spinning salad is delicious. I love the 1940s feel of the restaurant. All the waiters are so friend. We had the bone in prime rib with lobster, for the sides I had the cream of corn. Food was delicious lobster was not dry. They pudding bread is out of this world, dipping it with the sauce is so good. n nWell worth the price! I go now everytime I'm in vegas!",2
"I was super excited about coming here b c I loved my old Plato's Closet in Plano where I found TONS of awesome deals on usually pretty high priced clothes. n nThis place is really only a good deal if you are REALLY into Abercrombie and Hollister, other than that, the store is fairly limited in the brands it sells n nMaybe if it were slightly bigger it could carry more.",1
"There are huge matzoh balls in the soup here. However, the soup is a little on the bland side I had to add a lot of pepper. n nA slice of New York style cheesecake is ridiculously big. I started out helping someone on his dessert and thought there was no way we'd finish. Little did I know this would be the best cheesecake I'd ever tasted, so polishing it off was easy. n nThis is one of the cheapest good places to eat on the strip.",2
"I was pretty much in and out of this location on a Saturday night. It seemed a bit small and disorganized. The boyfriend and me still can't remember if that's grammatically correct, oh well. lol were looking for 5 Hour Energy shots and walked throughout the health and beauty section, which is where they are usually located. Couldn't find them at all. Also couldn't find an employee to help. Found them in the checkout aisles when we were heading out. Is that seriously the only place they are? Meh. I'll pass on a return.",1
"7 31 nLate lunch was a Quiche Lorraine, which came with a side salad. Looked absolutely delicious, but did not provide the mouth feel I craved. I was still reeling from the blissful onion tarte I had at Coup des Tartes and was hoping to reclaim that gastronomical ""hit "" with the cake y quiche it was a bit dry . Greens were also a tad under dressed. n nI wouldn't order the quiche again, but I will go back and try other items. In the meantime, I'll just admire the photos I took at Essence.",1
"I like the gastropub look and feel, but honestly the menu had too many fried items for my taste. The quality was good but I think it could be healthier. n nOur waitress was super sweet and I still have to go back and check out the upstairs, but I'n not sure I would have dinner there again. I give em 2 starts because the hype lead me to believe it would be 4. n nKeepin it real.",1
"I love the decor in this place Trendy Gothic with a Spanish feel. nThe food was OK, nothing crazy good to me. The popular appetizer right now is deep fried avocado and they have it. I thought the Avocado came in a tie with the grilled shrimp as for the best things we ate. We tried the Steak and shrimp with cilantro rice and grilled tomatoes. The cilantro rice had maybe a hint of something but was very bland to me. The grilled tomatoes had no taste even a splash of lemon juice or a pinch of salt before they grilled it would've helped taste wise. nThe waiter had a whole speech as to how their steak was excellent and it was the same steak as in the expensive steak house I forgot the name in the Silverton. So we were sold but the steak wasn't tender and I had to ask for sauce to deep it in for taste. nThe shrimp had a yummy sauce on it. nMy brother really enjoyed his steak salad in a taco shell and my kid's cheese quesadilla was passable as well. nThe service was slow.too slow.the waiter at some point did come up to me and said that because I wanted my steak well done it would take longer which is fine to me but bring out all the other stuff like the kid's meals and the easy salad! So even with all that it must be known that we were only the 3rd table with people in there so the extra slow service was just weird to me. nMy main problem was with the young lady who was the greeter at the front. It was a Sunday afternoon on Father's day and her demenor was just awful. She hardly cracked a smile and she had ""I hate my job "" written all over her face! I watched her with each customer that she brought to their table and each time it was just so unfriendly, so unwelcoming. I told our waiter what I felt and I hoped that he passed along the right channels because there are so many people right now that so badly need and want a job and that would appreciate one. So it just sickens me to see public service employees act like that. n nOh and as we were leaveing she didn't even look at as and then as we were going to turn a corner we heard in a very low monotone voice just like in a weird freaky movie ""Thankyou, have a nice day "" My Mother looked at me and said how nice she was thanking our backs.",1
"Food was okay. Atmosphere was quaint. Can only speak for the ladies but if you have to potty you may wish to go somewhere else. As for the service, it was awesome.",1
This is located inside the M Resort and Spa away from the strip. Great place to hang out and let the traffic die down before driving back to LA. Free Wifi. Beautiful and yummy desserts.,2
Two words COME HERE. n nPlace looks phenomenal. It's definitely one of the coolest bars I've seen yet. n nPrice You're in Vegas. Don't give weird looks when drinks are over 14.,2
"This place is awesome! Came here late at night while staying at the hotel across the street and the bartenders were cool, hipster types but unlike many who are pretentious, they were super friendly and made my girlfriend and I feel right at home. 5 stars all the way!",2
Fun place. Good bar food. My server was great. There was live music. Will go back for sure.,2
You should never take any computers to be fixed here. They have the poorest customer serveice and they don't do repairs on time. This is not a good business if you work from home with your Mac as I do.,1
"Really bad. Really. Just don't. n nI normally write longer reviews, much longer, but just don't. It's really bad, not as a buffet, but as, anything. n nDon't.",1
"I called Handy Andy after reading all of the glowing reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, my experience was nothing close to those I read. n nI had several things around the house that needed repair and, after going over the details with one of the representatives not Andy , an appointment was set up for the following day. I reconfirmed the appointment time in the morning, then rearranged my work schedule including two meetings to make sure I was here to meet him. The appointment time came and went after an hour and a half, it was clear no one was showing up. I left two messages phone and email to find out what had happened. No one bothered to return my messages or apologize for the inconvenience. Apparently, their time is more valuable than mine.",1
"We mistakenly chose to host an 65th wedding anniversary family celebration at Vincent's. At the end of the meal, as we were trying to collect our uneaten desserts, Vincent became enraged by the delay to his waiters' ability to clear the table. We later surmised that the threat of overtime pay prompted this entirely inappropriate, frightening response. The alternative and civil approach would have been to help the guests while simultaneously clearing. nThe honorees, ages 87 and 88, had been loyal and frequent customers for over 30 years. They were deeply shaken and frightened by Vincent's threatening loss of self control which escalated to threats and his grabbing of my 87 year old mother's arm . No member of my family will ever step foot near this establishment again. Unfortunately, Vincent's inappropriate behavior trumped any value associated with food.",1
"Ok. So while I was waiting for my pizzas at Pizza Hut, which was around the corner in the same building. I of course head to the Hawaiian section. Last time, I got some Li Hing Keiki. This time, I bought some Banana Chips and more Li Hing Mui. I also got packages of candy. The store brand packages of orange slices, carmel candy, and gummy worms.Each package was 39 cents. I was in shock to see that it went from 1 to 39 cents, so I bought 3 packages of orange slides, one of gummy worms, and one of carmel candies. I haven't opened them yet, but when I do, I will be in paradise.",2
"Ewwww dude. This wasn't very good. After taking well over an hour to deliver food on a Thursday night. It was cold, soggy, and not appetizing. I ordered the sesame chicken, which was really sweet and sour chicken sprinkled with sesame seeds. The crab puffs were soggy and under cooked. The only things thought was decent was the egg fried rice. I have yet to find a decent delivery place in tempe, and this makes me sad ",1
"Took my sister for her birthday, enjoyed a yoga class and massage. Yoga instructor was a sub and was great. She described every pose and was fun too. Massage was pleasant although the room was chilly. We ordered lunch which was 45 minutes late, no biggie gave us a chance to enjoy the pool. Overall it was a pleasant experience, only downside is the front desk staff I would not say they are the friendliest.",2
"After a so so first visit I took my wife for a quick lunch. Under pressure to order from a extensive menu, so we felt cheated that we might have ordered a better item. Food did arrive promptly but very average salad was nothing more than a large bowl of romaine, dressing was pretty tasteless, sandwich was very inferior even to Jayson's. nValue for money I'd score less than 2 stars. Well below average experience.",1
"Hipster version of Town Square. n nThe container park is essentially 200 square foot re purposed containers stacked upon each other to create a outdoor shopping mall. Most of the units were vacant during the soft opening but I am sure they will fill up as time passes. Many of the stores were boutiques selling handmade clothing, accessories and snacks, along with a few art galleries. Keep in mind that unlike other shopping areas you won't find any franchise or chain stores here. This place is excellent collection of Mom n Pop style shops. small businesses ftw! n nThe park itself is beautiful another great architectural addition to downtown. A giant fire breathing preying mantis greets you at the entrance. The centerpiece is a massive children's playground making the Container Park a great family friendly spot. The outdoor stage for shows and grassy field is going to be great for summer shows and is flanked by plenty of bars to drink up at. The atmosphere is friendly and the park is fun to just run around and explore. n nThe Container Park is a must see for any downtown trip and really illustrates how much the whole DTLV scene is evolving.",2
Everything was so yummy and fresh! They have so many choices as well for vegetarians and gluten free eaters. It's a great vibe with friendly service! Awesome lunch spot!,2
"Oh man, I love the Taco Truck. I stalk them regularly on twitter and Instagram for daily menus and their current location, which they are great about sharing. Most often, I'll visit the truck at The Coffee Buddha in Perrysville because it's not too far from home. They always have at least one veggie option, and it's always mouth watering! And cheap! To date we've tried the black bean tacos and the curried potato tacos my favorite! , but they also have a tofu taco on occasion and a samosa type choice which I'm desperate to try. I'll have to keep stalking I guess! nThe turn around has always been quick considering the quality of the product. The ingredients are incredibly fresh and high quality. They even offer vegan cheese and I believe all tacos are 100 gluten free! Bonus! nI look forward to PGH Taco Truck Wednesday's at The Coffee Buddha. They've been branching out location wise recently, so look for them near you soon! I wonder if I can convince them to park outside of my house for a few hours?",2
"My husband and I ate here Friday and we were impressed. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and this place was spicy! But that's a good thing! We bought a groupon for this restaurant, and we've decided to buy another one! We shall be returning!",2
Be careful of what activity is going on when you visit. DO NOT for food go when there is a drawing or contest. Your food and service will suffer greatly!,1
"Delicious Asian food ranging from 4 different kinds of curry, a variety of stir frys, and local favorites like pad thai and orange chicken which has been voted best orange chicken in the valley multiple times . Definitely better then Pei Wei and always excellent customer service. They really will make it EXACTLY how you want it. n nI'd suggest the Hot Korean, Stir Fry Crispy Beef, the Wonton Soup, or the Cantonese Chow Mein. Tell Young Rachael sent you. ",2
"I had heard great things about this sub shop, but honestly Mr. Goodcents subs are far better. The problem is the bread. It was hard, crumbly, not flavorable. The tomatoes were slimmy and on verge of rotten. I was also disappointed only Pepsi products and NO DR PEPPER on the fountain. On the plus side the turkey was high quality and sliced to order.",1
"Awesome! I had pho with well done brisket and it was great. I have a favorite Vietnamese pho place that is Zagat rated back in Philadelphia and the pho at UnPhoGettable was very similar. The noodles are perfect and the broth was delicious. The meat was also very tender, melted in your mouth and had no fat. The soup came with basil, lime, sprouts, and jalape u00f1os like usual, which were all very fresh. The service was great also. Always had a drink, food came out fast, and very friendly servers and owners. Great place for pho lovers! I will definitely be going back!",2
