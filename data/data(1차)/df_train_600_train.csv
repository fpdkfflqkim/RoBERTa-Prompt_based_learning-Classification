"Went for lunch today! Took over 30 minutes to receive our burgers! Ordered the Philly Burger with Cheez Whiz, still looking for the Whiz! No where to be found. Can only have the burgers medium which of course came medium welll! Asked for no onions, lo and behold onions on the burgers. Did refill our drinks without us asking! Probably to appease us for the very long wait. Extras for 1.00 mushrooms, ordered came with a portabella which was not stated. Did not take the 1.00 off the check. This was reflected in the tip we left. Not going back here EVER.",1
"Overpriced Denny's.the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and the prices were outrageous for what we were getting. The service however was amazing. I say this because we showed up here the first time at 4am drunk and the waiter was not only humorous, but was very attentive to my drunken ramblings. nWe went back sober, so I can with all confidence say hat food isn't amazing, although the french fries at 4am were pretty clutch. nPS.not that this is a bad thing for a sober person, but that menu is daunting, to say the least, when you are drunk. I mean, so many choices, and I'm indecisive.yikes",1
"Take a minute to brainstorm everything you hate about Walmart. Every generic , stereotypical thought you can come up with about this corporation. Go ahead, I'll wait a little longer. n nThis Walmart embodies every single one of those stereotypes. There is nothing good I can say about this place. Ok, maybe one good thing the people watching here is top notch. Especially on a Friday night or the 1st of the month . n nI have been to this Walmart 3 times. I refuse to ever go again. It is seriously that bad. This is no exaggeration. You have been warned.",1
"This is probably one of the worst strip clubs in the US. Our limo driver took us here as some of our friends talked it up. The bouncers were hella RUDE, stuck up, and full of themselves. We had a group of 10 people, guys and girls, and they wanted to charge everyone. Charging girls? We ended up going elsewhere and had much more fun. n nThere are ALOT more better places to go to in LV if you are looking for a strip club. Better looking girls, better attitude, and much more fun. n nI do NOT recommend ANYONE coming here. Waste of time.",1
"More to come from the 5 other yelpers in my party who had the same experience as I did. I just wanted to beat them all to the punch. To sum up what they will say in what I'm sure will be great detail n n1. The good not great, reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time. n2. Now reading a bunch of other reviews here I see this isn't an uncommon story. n3. Most of the drinks we had were good, including bloody maries, but make your own mimosas by buying champagne and a side glass of OJ.",1
"I have been here twice and after the first time I realized that this isn't the best mexican food out there. I have had better mexican in Charlotte. However it is a good place to have drinks while catching up with friends. n nI enjoy spicy mexican food so Vida isn't the best option for me, but those who do not like spicy do enjoy this place. n nI have had their margaritas and they are great. Their guacamole is also really good and their salsa is good, the spicy salsa you have to ask for it is really good and definitely has a kick.",1
"If there is a chance at you catching a show here, then you should really jump at the chance due to the intimacy of the venue and their ability to score the occasional mid level act. I've seen several acts here, including Phoenix and Bob Schneider and although crowded, it was awesome due to stage proximity. n nI cannot imagine another reason to visit this place other than to see a show, cos things like 'cover' and 'curtained booths' and 'mashup djs' should be enough to turn you right around. n nAlso, I find something sinister and disturbing about 'chain nightclubs'.",1
"The food was simply delicious, and the atmosphere was equal to the task. BUT the service was so poor I will never return. I think the bartender was doing double duty as the server, which meant we got our food when there was a lull at the bar. Lunch literally took an hour and a half, and we didn't receive all the food we ordered. Which was a good thing because we were so satisfied with what did come that there was not room for the additional items. Only problem was that they didn't make it to table, but they definitely made it to the tab.",1
"Blech! Unfortunately ate here twice while staying at Luxor for a conference. The worst buffet in Vegas! Everything tastes like it was frozen then defrosted and plopped into serving dishes! Yuck.lunch offerings were dry and over cooked pork loin, fried chicken and beef stroganoff. Both my husband an I hated everything that was sampled.EVEN dessert! How do you mess up dessert! Well ask Luxor cause they seem to have it down! Sundays champagne brunch was better.only because with all the alcohol everything tastes better!",1
"These people are the worst. They get a little power over you and they treat you like garbage! They are like Nazis! Just mean for no reason. I hate dealing with them. Curt and impersonal. Avoid at all costs! They like to call themselves a law firm, but they are a collection agency with absolutely no personal touch. They obviously do not depend on repeat business from anyone they deal with and they show it. I have never written a review before, but I was compelled to after my last phone call with Christine. Good luck!",1
"Booked ahead so, no problem. Sink was dirty. Posted a pic. Got a no smoking room. Had cigarette burns on TV bedside table and blanket on bed. Only smelled a bit like cigarettes. Only had one wash cloth two towels and two hand towels. When questioned they said they were fully booked and didn't have any more wash cloths. There were two of us booked for the room. They gave us hand towels to wash with. Staff was nice and polite. Bed too close to wall. Only a hand span wide. Room is big enough for two night stands and bed could be further int the room. It was livable but probably won't be back.",1
"If your primary objective is to have a relaxing place to go with friends or the kids and the food does not matter very much the Buca Di Beppo is the place for you. The food is OK but that it about it. When you get past the quantity you realize that the food is pretty bland. It is the Olive Garden of family style Italian. A chain that does family style right, although it is a bit more pricey, is Maggiano's Little Italy. There you can get loud, enjoy your friends, but have much better quality food.",1
"If I can give this place 0 stars I would. We were stopped by a promoter to go to the Eclipse Night club where Daylight is during the day. She told us it was free for guys b4 midnight. Wrong. We got there and had to pay 40 bucks at the door. Not to mention EVERY bouncer told us something different. There were 4 lines and none of them made any sense. Nobody knew the answer to any question and the cashier didnt have a clue. If someone tells me it's free, I assume it's free. Don't set up a promoter booth if you're gonna feed us BS. Terrible.",1
I have never felt so unwelcome in a doctors office before the staff treats me like a leper. They have very little compassion and its obvious they do not like middle class acchss patients I'm sorry I'm not a rich Scottsdale lady! Im 37 weeks along and wish I could find a new doctor. Dr. Webb is very nice and good at his job its his staff that needs to learn compassion and patients. The lady who answers the phone shelly is the worse! SO RUDE the front desk isn't much better. No smiles or pleasantries just cold in and out no questions asked. A how are you doing? Would kill you!,1
"The customer service through CES has been going downhill for the last few years and they keep making the free registration deadline earlier earlier Who's thinking about a trade show taking place in January in August? They are losing a lot of smaller companies who aren't willing to shill out the extra 500 to have passes not to mention losing for the Las Vegas economy has anyone noticed that there are less and less people each year? n nHopefully they will get some staff on board who are nicer and more interested in getting all trades involved, not just the big names.",1
"Finally got a table the other day. NOTHING HAS ANY SALT IN IT! I've seen other reviewers have the same complaint. There was literally no detectable salt in the salsa tomatillo or chipotle , or the tacos or chile rellenos. I think this might actually be a problem in sensory perception by either the chef management or both? I never put salt on food at the table, especially in restaurants, but everything we had was flat and vegetal tasting. You're better off for flavor going to Mad Mex as much as I hate to admit it. Shoot, maybe even Taco Bell.",1
"Ok this is not going to be good. I had a craving for fish chips and this place is close to me so I decided to try it. There was another customer in there waiting on her order and I was at the register viewing the menu to see what to try when out of the corner of my eye I see a bug crawling up the wall. The other customer also saw it and brought it to the lady behind the counter's attention but she was acting dumb till I said out loud ""Its right here "" pointing at it. Not even an I'm sorry or nothing. I left disgusted!",1
"Nothing special. nI had cheesey bread sticks and a five cheese pizza delivered, the delivery guy gave me attitude because it was near closing It was a half hour before hand which I thought was reasonable . The sauce is bland and so is the crust and my bread sticks were plain. When I say plain, I mean they didn't even put garlic butter on them let alone the cheese I paid extra for. I'm certain this was done on purpose, oh well! Next time I'm in pinch for a late night pie, I will take my business elsewhere.",1
Was there and the food was average. Then there was an off duty Pittsburgh Police officer in there eating.naturally he had his service weapon concealed however the manager came up and asked him if he had a weapon. The officer identified himself as a PIttsburgh Police officer and told the manager that he had his service weapon. The manager asked him to leave.the nerve. I will never enter your establishment again as long as you have concealed carry policy and to apply it to law enforcement is absurd.,1
"That's it I've had it with this office! I can't do it anymore! These people don't work. The girls that do the scheduling need to go back to school. I've been here 5 times now, every time I am an hour waiting past my appointment! They just put me in the wrong room. And now I'm not even going to get to see the doctor. They don't respect me or my time. I'm done! I'm telling her what my problem is, and she's writing filling out her paperwork. How can she write and listen to me at the same time! Very dismissive. Doesn't even look at me when she's talking. This place sucks I'm never coming back!",1
"Good prices, but I won't go there again. I dropped a shirt off that I needed for New Years Eve. I went in Dec 30 but it wasn't ready. When I came to pick it up NYE at 4, the place was closed. No sign, no warning. They closed at 2. n nWhen I talked to the owner after, he said they were trying to tell people about closing early. HOW ABOUT A SIGN DUMBASS! I told him they didn't tell me that and asked for a credit but he just didn't care that I had to spend 27 on a new dress shirt because they decided to close early and not tell anyone. n nVERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!",1
"What a disappointment, this was our first and will be our last time eating here. To start the girl who rung us up was very rude. We got there about 11 30 and beat the lunch rush but still waited 30 minutes for our food to come out. I order the vegetarian sandwich on ciabatta bread, when it finally came out it was on soggy wheat bread and cold fries. Christian got the veggie burger which had avocado and lettuce and nothing else on it, he also got the sweet potato fries which were also cold and lacked flavor. nDont recommend, save your money, go else where",1
"Don't go unless it's free or a comp. Unless you like frozen convenience food baked fresh for you, this isn't a real restaurant. I went because of the 30 foot salad bar that they supposedly had. Yes, it could have been 30 foot station, but that doesn't mean they have 30 feet of salad bar offerings. The day I went, there was fresh spinach and fresh lettuce, dressings and toppings, and a make your own sandwich offering. This occupied about 5 feet. Why brag about a 30 foot build out with only 5 feet worth of fresh food? FYI I went for lunch.",1
"Lousy customer service! The blonde girl the cashier boy short one you both sucks! Made me wait in line for nothing. I picked 2 Pima basic for 20. The cashier boy said it's 12.95 each. I have to get the right one, went back to the rack, met the blonde near the front door, she said ""yes, they're 2 for 20 "" I went back to the cashier he insist ""no, they didn't ring up "" WTF! It's not rocket science. Every H M has it, can't believe it! I will call your head office for such an incompetent service. nNo surprised, Maghan the blonde girl gave me bad number for customer service. However, I found one",1
"Just like hooters but even worse service! I've never been so disappointed in a bar. The food was decent, wasn't expecting much but for bar food it was ok. The beers were nice and cold that's for the 2nd star but the SERVICE. I don't know how they couldn't even call it that? She came to our table 2 times and she wasn't hesitant to drop the bill off before our party was finished. Even worse she never came back to get it and someone from our party had to get up and personally ask for a Togo box from the bartender. Will definitely not be returning!",1
"I have been in the food industry for 26 plus years, as an chef from Ireland, I have both been to France and cooked in France. This is by far some of the worst prepared french dishes I have EVER had. The brioche and I only call it that as that is what it was called on the menu looked and tasted nothing like brioche. n The basket of warm sliced baguette, which is lunch bread in France, was a strange item to receive for breakfast. The one positive for me was the busboy kept the coffee cups and water glasses full. n n Over all this was a restaurant experience I won't be able to get back.",1
"I personally did not like the show. I have seen several Cirque shows, which leads to kind of having a certain expectation of the Cirque du Soleil shows. This is just not up to what I was expecting. I can appreciate the show, but again, I was coming in with a certain 'cirque' expectation. Too much dancing, not enough ""cirque "". It would be one thing if mosst of the dancing was good, but it was not. Alot of the dancers were just no insync when they were suppose to be. n nI do like the the nostalgia of the show, hearing 'the King' rock the stage. Maybe they can add more cirque ness later?",1
"We ordered for takeout and it took forever during non peak hours and they screwed up our order. My boyfriend ordered the Philly Cheesesteak pizza but they gave him the sub, because it took so long, we didn't bother complaining. We also ordered a pepperoni mushroom and olive pizza. The sub was good but the pizza quality was just a step above frozen pizza quality. The mushrooms were canned not fresh and the crust was kind of greasy. We picked it because of it being close to the Rio and the other Yelp reviews, but we'd have been better off ordering from Pizza Hut or Domino's.",1
"I love Steak 'n Shake. Just not this branch, unfortunately. I was initially surprised that it was a SNS lite fast food esque when I walked through the door and further unpleasantly surprised by the low quality and saltiness of the parties themselves. The whole point of going to one of these establishments relies on the extensive menu, the atmosphere of a sit down restaurant with overstuffed bench seating, and the friendliness of the staff. This branch only had the latter, which was not enough for me to want to return. sad face ",1
"I got the veggie wrap which should have been called mostly spinach wrap. It had absolutely no mushroom or other veggies in it. It didn't taste bad just realistically was lettuce and tortilla. It's always so crazy to me how veggie anything cost so much more than meat. I spent 9.45 for the wrap and a drink which wasn't worth it. When the girl came to serve me, she rudely and sarcastically mentioned that I need to put my number on the table ring. IVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE! AND IM THE ONLY NEW CUSTOMER THATS WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR IN 10 MINS! I don't think I'll be coming back",1
"ASU used to be just a shitty school with too many students and lots of partying. Now it's a shitty school with even more students and slightly less partying with delusions of being an Ivy League institution. ASU is alright if you recognize it for what it is a school for people not able to get in anywhere else or for Arizonans who don't want to leave our beautiful state for their education. If you go expecting anything more than that, you'll be extremely disappointed. It's definitely not worth the price and if I didn't have a merit scholarship, I wouldn't go.",1
I would do no stars if I could.worst attorney ever! He took my and did nothing for months except string me along. He didn't fight at all for me and knew nothing about my case when we went before the judge. I have never been in need of an attorney so I found him off the internet. Biggest mistake if my life. I have since talked to many others in similar situations and I am amazed at how much better their representation was. I am not one to review often but this was so bad I had to make sure others know,1
"Horrible!,If i could give it no stars i would. We get an estimate of 50.00 on the internet, when we get there are bill is 203! we asked if we could use are own insurance, No we have to use theirs, which is a lie . O and because we are local we have to bring in a Proof of Residence which is a bill and they put an extra 350 hold! All in all this place has bad employees including managers and mis rep a lot! I was wondering what was taking people so long at the counter until i got up there and found out the reason why. This place sucks. go with enterprise.",1
"I wanted to say first that I tried my hardest to like this and I really wanted to like it. However , for a Vegas show at the Wynn there is so much that could of improved it. The music is good obviously because it is just play Sinatra tracks. nObviously there is a lot of dancing but, there needs to be stage transitions and the storyline is very weak. nThis is really a show you expect at Imperial Palace or Flamingo. Thankfully the show was half off on Travel Zoo. The most entertaining thing I saw when the show was over I had no clue Mario Lopez was sitting in front of me. Slater!",1
My bestie tried the fish tacos and I indulged with the chicken steak fajitas. Fajitas are always a winner. I mean it's pretty hard to mess those up. The fish tacos were great. The only thing lacking was the service I hate being pitched. this guy was trying to make a quick buck and was so busy trying to up sale everything he kept forgetting what we needed or asked for. The manager Ashley is wonderful and helpful and really seems to have a firm grasp on how important the customers are to her line of work. Our server not so much. On a side note. all the servers seemed pretty miserable.,1
"Come here with the expectation of loosening your pants by the end. nAnd eat the french toast. n nthere is some serious and unabashed EGG CHEESE PORK love here, so sidle up and get some. n nPersonally, it's not for me. It feels a lot like a 90s business lunch place. Think Ferris Bueller's Dad cob salad with lots of cheese meat and potatoes. The ""creative "" twist every one is talking about is a 90s plating device, more about presentation that new and distinct tastes. But if the in laws are in town from Minneapolis.well, this is the place.",1
"Relatively lazy service can't get a refill on your coffee to save your life nOK food no kids breakfast menu, though, so my kids had to split a regular entree nThe ""healthy "" omelet I had was cooked in so much oil that I didn't feel so healthy afterwards nApparently, people regularly chew tobacco here. at their table. first thing in the morning. because when I asked for a paper cup to give to my toddler I was asked if it was to use as a spittoon, since that's what most people ask for them for. Gross.",1
Seven days after Karen P. of iPic Theaters responded to my review and asked for my contact information I have not heard back from iPic or received a credit for the 48.00 charge for 2 tickets. I guess I shouldn't have expected anything different since our entire iPic experience was a disappointing disaster and definitely not what they advertise. I will continue to visit AMC Esplanade and encourage all my friends who of course have been told this story and have continued to ask if iPic ever responded to do likewise.,1
"Only reason that I'm giving a ""bad "" review is that according to this site AND the Rosati's website, they are open until 10PM on Sundays. I called last night, which happened to be Sunday, at 9 20PM. I was told that they are closing in 10 minutes and the ovens were off. I mentioned that on both Yelp and their own website, that it states that they are open until 10PM. The girl apologized. n nReally no sweat off my back. I just called Round Table. They were more than willing to take my business, and it was a great pie.",1
"Wow, 5 stars? Did we stay at the same hotel? This location is the newer version where the room entrances are enclosed which is a plus. They've also had their renovation in the lobby with the high counter seating area. But my room smelled like stale smoke and the desk was really small. n nSo while the staff was super friendly and the location is actually more convenient to where I needed to be in Madison, on my return trip I opted to stay in the HGI in Middleton than endure another week in this less than acceptable Hampton.",1
"This is a very typical neighborhood Foodland. It looks like it hasn't been renovated since the days of the Steelers ""Immaculate Reception "", but it kind of has a certain well worn charm. The place is crowded and cramped too, but not unpleasant. The parking lot is very small, but as I was taking the ""T "", it wasn't an issue. I stopped here last night because I was in the neighborhood attending a meeting at someone's house close by and I volunteered to pick up a treat. n nI'd say that this place is worth it for your run of the mill staples and nothing else.",1
"Great beer, decent burgers, not great dinner.TOO LOUD ALL THE TIME! A place with 200 people doesn't need a crappy band to play way too loud. Last time I was there I found myself screaming to the girl across the table from me. We were 2 feet away from each other and on the opposite side of the place from the band.and it was so loud I felt like I was in a club. n nLose the bands, improve the dinners and keep the beers great and you have a good place. n nI had a jambalaya and it was just awful. It was rice with some meat and a spicy sauce. Not good at all.",1
"My wife and I went back to IDN last weekend and I was kinda bummed to find that the menu had changed along with the dining room, which was bigger and glitzier and the experience was overall rather poor. n nIt felt to me like they had fallen in to the classic restaurant trap get a little bit of success, overexpand, get out over your skis, cut back on the quality, go out of business. They're only at step 4, but a drag. We had the greek salad, very little feta not good. Entrees were forgettable. Oh well.",1
"If you have been to any other PHO restaurant, in any other city, Tram's Kitchen would be OUT OF BUSINESS! n nFor starters, the portion of the PHO is extremely SKIMPY! I don't think we have had such a small portion of PHO since we were Babies! Seriously, would it kill you to add more rice noodles? n nSince we had the PHO as our Appetizers, we then ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles.Oh wait.we paid for Seafood.but all we got were vegetables and some imitation they call seafood. What a Joke! n nSuggestion if you plan on going here. Come FULL and just order the Spring Roll.",1
"The opening ceremonies are over and well, it's not that great. In fact it is overpriced, noisy, and even if you discount the fact it's been open 10 days only its well below expectations. nThe wait staff uniform looks like a steakhouse cowboy theme. No table cloths for this price range. Food was mediocre. Scallops were undercooked 4 large in the entree . Soup looked lost in the big bowl and mussels were 20 unopened . There are much better selections in Charlotte for the same money. Life expectancy for this place is about a year. let's get Ramsey in here to help sort them out.",1
"Disappointed. Diner food. Very average. Too expensive for what you get. So many other options, kind of embarrassed for them! And yes, hollandaise did have a film. Are the plates reheated because they're per prepared or is it done on purpose? I don't know but will not eat there again. And as an Italian, bocconcini have no place on a breakfast plate. And the tomatoes used for the salad were old and grainy. Yuck! most dishes come nWith the side of tomato and bocconcini . The vinaigrette made is particularly bizarre.",1
"This place SUCKS. The lady that took my order was not very nice talkative or friendly. I ordered a white chocolate mocha and the lady turns over an ipad towards me and didn't ask me if I wanted to pay cash or cc, she assumed Im just going to pay with a cc, and I thought that was rude. Then on the screen when you sign your signature theres a box if you want to leave tip. Really! For the unfriendly cashier. The white chocolate mocha was not made correctly, not sweet at all tasted horrible. I took 2 sips and threw it out.",1
"I had been a customer at Morningstar Cleaners for about 5 years and found the prices to be great and the ladies who work the store front to be wonderful! However, I have now had 2 incidences of items returned to me with brown stains that were not previously there! The owner will not take responsibility for the stains, address me directly, or offer a reimbursement for the ruined clothing. BAD BUSINESS! I will not be returning! Simply acknowledging the mistake and giving me a fair price even a store credit for the ruined clothing would have kept me on as a long time customer.",1
"The casino itself is ok, had much better games then Green Valley, well, at least they had the ones I like to play. Ghost Busters, Hillbillies, Wizard. n nNow. to the BAD part. n nTHE BUFFET IS TERRIBLE! everything was cold and gross! I felt like i was in the scene of Vegas Vacation with Clark and Cousin Eddy when they are at the buffet and Eddy goes, ""Ill try some of the yella', gimme some of the blue. "" It was so bad! My dad basically just ate cold potatoes and ice cream. The ONLY saving grace of that dinner was the guy making the cheese steaks! BUT. they only serve those ONE night a week!",1
"The line for this place can be horrendous, and really, it's not that worth the wait. Most of the crowd can be ""trendy "" and stuck up, though some people are genuinely there to have some fun. Bottle service isn't worth it, and the music is pretty average for a club. The place can get REALLY packed, which provides for a wide assortment of people. The drinks are expensive, but they're made pretty well. This is a decent spot to hang with friends, but in my opinion it gets too crowded with people who are trying too hard to seem important. I'd go elsewhere to just hang and have a good time.",1
"There is just something about these Red Velvet Pancakes that make me forget that I don't like to eat pancakes lol. n nSince my initial review I've tried quite a few more items on the menu, most notably the Adobo Fried Rice omelet and the Huevos Rancheros. The adobo fried rice blew my mind. 1 Because it was delicious and 2 I'm filipino and it never once crossed my mind to mix adobo and fried rice. WHAT EVEN. n nThere are now two locations and the quality of the food at the new location is just as good as the quality of the food at this location. n nAlso the name has changed lol.",2
"Wow. Best ever Miso Ramen order it with double extra Chashu. nIt is so rich, complex and creamy. I hate to tell you about it because the place is so small. I am in love with one of the girls that work there. Is that politically incorrect? n nThe Chashu is so moist, cut extra thin but oh so good.Chashu isn't like char siu which you may have seen in Chinese restaurants. Japanese chashu is actually braised instead of being barbecued so it's soft, tender and moist. n nPlease don't go there. I don't want to wait outside on the wooden bench!",2
I'm going to get straight to the point. This is one of my favorite station casinos. I've won nice sums numerous times on the slots and today was my first time playing a sport's wager. It's a very welcoming casino and definitely has the local feel to it. I also love the Feast Buffet's Sunday Champagne Brunch! But I'll leave that part to another review. The only reason I am giving this casino 4 stars is because it lacks some of the bells and whistles that the Strip casino's have to offer. But hey if you're a local you should love it! Peace.,2
"Tschane and I went to 'wichcraft two times during our 24 hour stint in Vegas. It turned out to be a welcome break from trashy road trip food. a healthy alternative, one might say. n nThe soup is decent, salads are really fresh. Both the soup and salad are served with ample bread. n nThey also sell creative sandwiches. For example the celery, spinach, avocado, goat cheese, and sprouts sandwich was excellent, as was the reuben panini. They sell kettle chips too Yummy. n nMy recommendation get some takeout and head to Red Rock for a picnic lunch!",2
"We went there for brunch for 37 a person with tax it goes to 40 dollars even. I have to admit the service was great as the people gave us our drinks and then cleaned our table as soon as we got more food. They service bone marrow, kalbi beef, chicken sausage and all the trimmings. It was very good, they do have an omelet station, wished i tried it, but was too lazy to wait. Pretty big, the quality of food was great and dessert was good. Great buffet, not so sure for 40 a head, but lot of variety which is nice.",2
"I just had this on Friday and I thought the food was awesome. Its also the first buffet I've been to where you can make your own pizza. Unfortunately this place did not meet the hype that it has for being the best buffet of 2007. The setup of the place could have used a little more work too because some sections were too far away from one side and that it might have easily been unnoticed. I expected a much greater selection, but since it was lunchtime and it was cheaper, I'll let it slide. Good food though nonetheless. I still recommend the buffets at the Rio or the Mirage.",2
"I wish they would come closer to the southwest at least once a week. I really like this food truck. The people are friendly and service has been great as well. n nWe've had their Manny Pacquiao tacos 4 5, stuffed hotdog 3 5, mac n cheese bun 3 5, tator tots truffle deluxe 5 5. n nOmg! Those tator tots are frigging the bidniz the bidnaz. Genius! n nLike I said, I wish they traveled closer to my area. Having to haul my family to hunt down tasty bunz in the other side of Vegas is a pain in the ass.",2
"This place is pretty crackin', my favorite club next to Marquee. It's very spacious, had fabulous decor, love the waters outside and you can dip your feet in the water, felt soooo goood , and the fun gambling table with a great dealer. We had fun despite the fact that the DJ wasn't so great Warren Peace but with great company, can't go wrong! Decided to buy presales and cut the line. My friends without presales got in pretty early just arrive by 930 ish . We bounced after Call Me Maybe came on please do not play this song in Vegas. . n nDef one of the top clubs in Vegas.",2
"After having not so pleasant experience with another dental office that has multiple locations, I was not looking forward to finding a new dentist. n nHOWEVER, my first impression was a good one, the receptionist was very friendly and I was seen not long after I arrived. I was greeted by everyone who came in contact with me, in a friendly manner. Dr. Brittian was very thorough and I even found out that I didn't need all the expensive dental work the ""other dentist "" told me I needed! I will definitely recommend him.",2
"Went back to Vegas, went back to Thai Style Noodle House. Sat at the same table, ordered the same food. Jeez I sound boring. But I just loved it. n nThis time I went with obliging yelper husband and we split the yummy curry and the two appetizers. We both loved it. n nWord to the wise I couldn't remember how hot I ordered it the first time. Husband likes things hotter than I do so we compromised and ordered a 5 out of 10 . Husband said he'd go down to 4 next time and I said I'd go down to 3. So keep in mind that they're serious about the spicy.",2
"My fianc u00e9 and I were having trouble finding the perfect ring. I know jewelers and places to get great deals but I wanted something original and unique. We walked into Galicia and were amazed. I tried on one ring and knew that the first one was IT. It is stunning, completely different, elegant, and was affordable considering the other 3 carats we were looking at. If you are just looking for a deal on a cheap stone, don't come here. If you are looking for something beautifully designed with personality and elegant style look no further.",2
"My husband gave this a 4 but I would give this a 3 1 2 . pros more organized layout of food stations unlike Bellagio which was difficult to manoeuvre, great ambience unlike Bellagio's cheap interior, better quality food. My kids love the gelato, my husband loves the pizza which was very good, prime rib was good. I think overall quality and variety were good but nothing stands out for me. I liked the curry cauliflower, curry beans, salads were good but the meat dishes were not that good to me. Fish dishes were either overcooked, too salty or too sweet.",2
"This is my favorite gym ever! The equipment is nice and there is a lot of variety. I like how they have something for everyone. Can't speak for the classes as I haven't been to them BUT I am sure they are wonderful. The staff is very attentive and greets everyone that comes into the door. I feel like the gym and locker room are always clean and well maintained. I like the flow of this gym as well, if you are looking for a laid back gym with good equipment and good employees and an awesome contract then here you are! We pay 19 month for two!",2
"We went here for lunch on Saturday and it was quite busy. Service was good but slightly delayed I guess because they were busy ha! nI agree that their fries are over salted but the burgers are pretty good. Fried pickles are even better. n nWe had a reservation since I figured it may be helpful to get in faster, it helped. So if you have a family of 4 or 5 and up call and make sure the have room specially if you are going here for lunch or dinner on a weekend. n nI should have taken picture of my food.maybe next time.",2
"So this is another little neighborhood spot I like to visit. I come here regularly to grab one of their sandwiches. They have a good group of sandwiches with fresh mozzarella , meats, marinated peppers, etc. Just good stuff I tell ya. n nThe pizza? Avoid em if you're looking for killer pizza. It is not bud but he dough is pre baked so its nothin fancy. n nAs for the rest of the store? It's a little overpriced corner liquor store.what do you expect? n n nYou gotta get in there for a sandwich.good little spot for something different.",2
"If you are someone who is afraid of partying around a younger crowd then this is not the place for you. This was my second time going this time with my husband, sister, and other family , none of whom are under the age of 30 and we had a blast. Are the drinks overpriced? Yes, it's Vegas. Are some of the bouncers douchy, um yeah.it's Vegas. Will you see people drinking and puking.YEAH, IT'S VEGAS! It's FUN. So have a laugh at others expense and enjoy yourself. Do forget to laugh at yourself as well. 0 ",2
"Palmyra is a great place for a late night feast whether you are returning from a night club with a few bevvies in you or from a massive study session the library and just need to get some for of comfort food there is always something for you to enjoy. n nThe food is great, and there are always massive portions try the Shawarma kebab in naan rool, yum! with the staff being some of the friendliest and funniest I know in any late night place in Edinburgh. If you decide to stay in the restaurant and chat with them, there are plenty of tables to sit and enjoy your food.",2
"We had a wonderful experience at the 107 lounge! We went there for their Happy Hour where you can enjoy 2 for 1 cocktails. The view was unrivaled! Amazing food and excellent service! There was a vast selection of appetizers that will make your mouth water. We particularly enjoyed the choices that our server, Christy, suggested to us. She was upbeat, friendly, and very informative. All her recommendations were spot on, including the fondue, Vietnamese sandwich, and carpaccio. This place has definitely become a favorite!",2
"I was in Charlotte for a conference. Since I was still recovering from jet lag, I wanted to go to a restaurant that was walkable from my hotel. I ordered take out since I planned to go to bed after dinner. My order was ready when I arrived. The hostess was very pleasant and talkative. The ambience in the restaurant was great. It was fairly empty, but I was there at 6pm. I ordered the eel and avocado roll, as well as, the Angry Bird roll. Both were amazingly delicious! I would definitely visit again if I am back in the area.",2
"I've seen this place million of times since I've been in Charlotte and has never once tried it until a couple of weeks ago! My husband use to go to school by there and told me it was not good so that kind of stop me from trying it although I've heard good reviews from other people. n nWe finally decided to try this place since we wanted a break from Viva Chicken and it was close by. I was amazed! I got a hibachi plate with steak, chicken and veggies. It was super delicious! The meat was cook just perfect with a flavor glaze that is so good.",2
"They do the best pedicures! Amazing prices. I got a deluxe pedicure for 25! Now that's a steal. Regular pedicure are 20 but for a deluxe pedicure it's just an extra 5 dollars. Includes a scrub, cooling mask, hot towels and a dead skin removal. It felt so good and everyone there is super friendly. They give you a complimentary box with your own personal supplies really sanitary and bottled water. nBy far the best salon I ever been to. Great customer service. Best pedicures in town. Amazing services. Definitely come and give them a try. The prices are unbeatable!",2
"Listing all the food we ate for AYCE at Goyemon would give me carpel tunnel syndrome. I think the 7 of us cleared off about 50 plates. n nBest of the best n n Braised pork belly A n Masago w quail egg A n Each and every one of the fresh sushi A n nService n So friendly, attentive, quick! n Make sure you ask them to check on an order if it doesn't come within 5 minutes. That just means they forgot, since their orders come out SUPER fast. n nAnd remember, you're in Vegas. nSake bombs are a requirement. n Get hot sake yummmmm! ",2
"I've visited this bakery several times over the past year or so. I like that they don't use artificial ingredients such as food coloring in their cupcakes. I've tried a half dozen or so different varieties of their cupcakes, and haven't been disappointed once. I'd really like the opportunity to try their Cupcake Wars winning tomato soup cupcake, but I never seem to be there when they are available. nI also like that they sponsor different theme days, and have food trucks come there. I like to see small businesses working together. It warms the cockles of my heart! ",2
"I never write reviews but welcome diner gave me every reason to start. I bartend and serve at another local restaurant and have to give it to them for their excellent service. The guy behind the counter was so enthusiastic about the food, and was patient with us since it was our first time. n nI got the champion burger and shared the pork fries. WOW, definitely the best burger I've had in a while. Cooke perfectly med rare and the flavors were perfect. n nThey also had a great beer and cocktail list. n nIt's a must try, and I'm looking forward to coming back to try the fried chicken. n nYUM!",2
"Got a decent deal on Groupon so we decided to make a balloon ride our anniversary my birthday present. The staff were very friendly and respectful, the ride was very smooth and memorable and afterwards there was a champagne and goodie ""picnic "" where we all got to socialize while they packed up the gear. n nAny more than 4 passengers basket will be a tight squeeze and sort of uncomfortable after a while so if you can afford a private ride for less I recommend that otherwise I recommend organizing a group of folks that you don't mind rubbing up against ",2
"This was the buffet that everyone said was the best in Vegas so I had to try it. It lived up to the hype. n nI was impressed with the variety of cuisines. There were many dishes I had never tried before. n nThe crab leg line was ridiculously long and people were putting like 20 legs on their plate at a time people you can get back in line when you want more . n nI'd say stay away from the sushi, it wasn't very good. n nThe line is long for this 50 a head buffet, so give yourself at least 2 3 hours to go to work. It's worth trying at least once. n nBring your appetite do work!",2
"So I yelped up this place and looked at their website and had to take my honey to this restaurant! Wow it was wonderful. The Salmon cake with corn pablano was a feast for the eyes and for the palate. nThe Thai ribs with fingerling potatoes had a sauce with just the right amount of spice. The meat was fall off the bone perfect and juicy. Perfect is perfect! nWith a good cocktail, Pama vodka and a nice simple single malt. What more can you say! nI will tell you Chocolate desserts that are chocoholic quality. nPark the car and come on in!",2
"Yummmmmy. We went here for breakfast on Saturday and it was so good. Their maple smoked bacon is the best thing ever, especially when you're starving from dancing all night! And because I was on vacation and didn't care about calorie count, I splurged and got the mini sliders for breakfast. And then added the bacon. Perfection! Could have used a little piece of tomato or lettuce, or maybe a pickle, but still so good! Loved our meal and the decor was super cute and trendy. Waitresses were friendly and attentive, and the cute little candy shop in the front is definitely a must see! ",2
"This airport is huge.maybe too big. It's Vegas, so there's slot machines all over. the cool part is that they had those revolving full body scanners, which I thought was pretty cool! I ate at the Burger King there and It was more pricey than other burger kings, but tasted the same haha. Some parts of the airport seemed pretty old, but it was interesting to walk through and explore before my flight back home. There's also a random monorail thing at the airport that takes you to the baggage claim after your flight gets into Vegas!",2
"Suns out, guns out. Or in this case. suns out, all the dirty cars out. n nThis location is bumping at most times. It's an Autobell, so there are real no surprises here. n nI took Lance here a couple weeks ago to save him from the pollen. He was a hot mess inside and out. As always, they did a great job. All the workers are super nice, too. Almost like brainwashed too nice, but I like it. n nTrying to take a left out of here when you leave? Good luck. I recommend hanging a right and going up to the light to turn around. South Blvd can be impossible sometimes.",2
"Had our son's Birthday Party here in May and it was awesome. Dealt with Mike to book the reservation and he was great. On the day of the party the entire staff was awesome, but Gisela ? Sorry. was particulary great. She did a great job with the kids and handled everything very efficiently. As for the facility, it was clean, plenty of room, plenty of jump area, plenty of parent area, etc etc. Much better than other places like it. I know one of the kids at our party has already booked his party there, so that will speak louder than this review!",2
"I obviously haven't spent enough time in Parc Lafontaine. I was always a Mt Royal person but I think that will change next summer. Lafontaine Parc reminds me of Central Park. It's larger, has a multitude of paths, nice water features like Westmount Park but it still relatively calm. They also have a restaurant that I'm dying to try and it's not as packed with tourists as most other Montreal greenspaces. Not to mention, you have bars like Le Lab right across the street. Certainly looking forward to spending more time here.",2
"Always wonderful! Friendly staff and great, fresh food. It is on the noisy side thought, but what do you expect for a family friendly resturaunt? The food is consistant at every location which is a plus as well. Never had a bad meal. Tamala Thursday is amazing! I am not a huge fan of their pork barbacoa, but I think it is either a love it or hate it type thing. I do love thier fire grilled chicken and highly suggest it. Their house dressing for their salads is amazing! I'd suggest to anyone for a quick bite to eat.",2
"Never noticed this place because it doesn't have a big pretentious sign. Had the chicken fried steak for breakfast. Generous portions and it was well cooked with just the right amount of spices. The home fries were huge and also well cooked. Excellent meal for 10 bucks! The also have lots of specials so I will be returning to try the other items! The service was also great, they always checked in to top off my coffee and water and they were friendly to boot! what a PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS PLUS",2
"Just a quick update, n nMarley's is one of our favorite restaurant in the West Valley. On our last visit, I had their BBQ ribs with their new fresh cut fries. First of all, I am not a fan of their new fries. Wished they never changed! Fries were to greasy, and salty. Please go back to the old fries. Their ribs was a huge portion, I thought is was pretty good. I have had better, seen them more tender. Flavor was good, but it seemed to be more from the sauce. Glad I tried them, they have much better option on the menu.",2
"I went here tonight for dinner, and I was quite happy with the experience overall. Unlike many other restaurants aimed towards attracting the ""hip "" crowd, this restaurant is actually very pleasant to dine in with no obnoxious decor, menu choices, or loud music. We were seated quickly, the wait staff was very attentive, and the food came out quickly as well. n nI had the pepperoni pizza and my girlfriend had the prosciutto, both were excellent and delicious. We will definitely be coming back here again due to the combination of a very inviting atmosphere and good food.",2
"I'd been here about 5 times and I love the amazing all you can eat sushi they have here! The fish is always fresh. I love their variety of rolls, appetizers, and dessert. The price is decent for quality and amount of food you get. There usually is a wait I never had to wait more than 30 minutes, and I learn to go earlier or later then the rush hour times. The waiters waitresses aren't attentive like in other reviews. But then again, some Asians don't tip well, so I guess you don't need to tip them as much as other restaurant you normally go to.",2
"I haven't been to this place in several years since I moved away from it down to my beloved Tempe but it is still as good as I remember. I didn't have a full meal but instead shared a bottle of Malbec from Argentina and a cheese plate while attending the Phoenix film festival and it was lovely. I love the ambience and the owner and wait staff are wonderful. If I lived closer, or if it was on the light rail, I would probably go more often but location is everything. If you live out in North Scottsdale this place is definately worth checking out. ",2
"I came here with my friend's Groupon. I read some of the reviews, and I was a little hesitant, but I thought I would give it a shot. I saw one review about the crab, and it was an amazing dish. My friend and I split the surf and turf, as I do not eat beef. The crab shell came opened, which is a major plus because I usually make a mess opening up the shell. The crab itself tasted delicious. We sat near the hostess, and she even made a comment that the crab smelled so good that she had to go outside to avoid being hungry! My friend enjoyed her steak and would give it a 5 out of 5.",2
"Went for a late dinner. I've been a fan of this chain for years. I was surprised it was still so busy at almost 8pm I know, 8pm isn't late, but it is when you're used to eating with your kids at 6 ! We were seated right away even though it was busy, but the service was a little on the slow side after that. That usually doesn't bother me though, I see it's busy and we weren't in a hurry. We split one meal, and they were kind enough to bring it out on separate plates. LOVE the Chicken Bryan, it's the only thing I've ever had to eat there besides the Lobster Ravioli, which is also excellent.",2
"I've seen Zumanity twice and I enjoyed it both times. I would describe it as a sensuous show, not a sexy one. n nIt's not a traditional Cirque show, but then, Cirque is breaking the mold with their newer shows, so there is less of a traditional show now unless you go back to the original Strip production of Myst u00e8re. n nThe outfits, gymnastics, and dancing in Zumanity make it very inviting. There are also some very funny parts that break up the more serious acts. n nDon't be shy and avoid Zumantiy. Give it a whirl.",2
"Dr. Mitchell is awesome! After suffering 6 months due to an injury. having gone to the doctor weekly, bi weekly, taking meds, completeing 2 months of physical therapy, chiropractic care, and massage therapy. he relieved the majority of my pain in just 1 visit. I can't recommend his practice highly enough! His staff is awesome. The location is clean and comfortable. It's funny how after living with pain for so long, you don't know what it's like to not be in pain. my attitude about life has improved tremendously!",2
"This place is rather popular among the locals! Every time I have been there, there is always a ridiculously long line. Good thing they work fast or else I would have just skipped next door. Food is okay not really that impressed . What I found I did love was there coffee and how they have their own barrista manning the counter by himself! Their expresso was rich, strong and smooth just the way I like it. Hence, the additional star. I would come back just for the coffee alone. Like previous reviews, their pastrie did look rather dry and bulk made so I didn't want to venture to try it.",2
"This place is fairly new. It's on Rainbow just north of the 215 in the same plaza as Firehouse subs and American Male. It's just like any of the other million self serve froyo places in town. The place was clean, flavors were good and there were plenty of toppings. They encourage you to put some of those toppings in the cup first, then the froyo, and finish it off by adding more toppings. That's the main differentiator between this place and all others. I'm still a fan of froyo, therefore I'm a fan of this place.",2
We have been going to the Tower of jewels for a couple of years now and all of the staff has been very helpful and we always feel like we've gotten a great deal and it always helps that I am a salesman myself so I can beat up the salesperson a little bit lol but all around my wife absolutely loves earrings necklaces and rings we purchased through the tower of jewels and they send us thank you cards and greetings cards around the holidays with coupons which is always nice thanks tower of jewels keep up the good work,2
"Probably the best sushi in town. Fresh fish always ! not easy in AZ nWe always enjoy the strong drinks . Not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat, so I would like to see more creativity but overall I love this place! nThe bar upstairs should be open for people who eat at the restaurant. You should not sand in line or pay the bouncer to get in after you spent 200 at the restaurant. nI would definitely recommend trying this place! I think they have great happy hours and summer specials right now. Worth a try !",2
"I moved to the Rhodes Ranch area a year 1 2 ago, and have been coming here since. Crystal does my pedicures and does such an amazing job, I never want to get out of my massaging chair as she works my feet gently to perfection. My husband gets his eye brows waxed and I am very picky about who I let touch his brows. But Mindy ,Or Crystal do excellent work! I would travel to come here. The nails for manis, and acrylic are so well done, and although they are super crowded, they will take you no problem. Highly suggest this place! I am not easy with my pedis, but they rock!",2
"I was recommended to go to Max Muscle from my awesome trainer yes the one I talk so much about . He knew that I wasn't getting enough protein in my diet, so he said, ""Go to Max Muscle "". So I did. nThis location, I was impressed with the knowledge of the manager that was working there that day. He was in great shape for a body builder.gross and even let me test drink different protein shakes. We chose the brand and flavor.and guess what? They were out of stock until Monday. Go figure. n nThis location is much better than the other location.which I will be review next.",2
"I bought a living social deal from Louie at Waterless. What a wonderful service! Sometimes people will give you less service when you purchase something discounted. Not Waterless! They gave me more! Three hours on my car, and it looked brand new! Better than ever! This is the best car wash I have ever had. The come to you at your convenience! They were on time, friendly, and took the time to give me wonderful customer service. I will be using them in the future, and will recommend them highly! They deserve 10 starts!",2
"I have been to this restaurant 3 times, and I will keep on coming back. I had a chicken soup was good, arroz chaufa good too, and a lomo saltado my favorite dish there so far! The staff is nice and I have no complaints. They do take a little longer when is busy, but that is expected as people eat at restaurants they like. I never waited too long for my food though. Overall, I like the food and the staff so I give it four stars. Also, I plan on bringing my peruvian family from out of town to this restaurant!",2
