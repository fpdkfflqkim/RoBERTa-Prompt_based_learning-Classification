"If you are looking for a church that teaches from and is centered around the Bible . This is the place! Everything from the church's mission of ""Doing Justice, Loving Mercy and Walking Humbly With Our God "" to the teaching and the music speaks of the dedication to help people develop a relationship with Jesus. There are many ways to connect and my family felt welcome immediately and we found it very easy to get connected.",2
"NO STARS ACTUALLY! nDO NOT COME HERE FOR DIM SUM! I REPEAT.DO NOT! n nMy family and I frequent this place regularly for dim sum. But yesterday was the last and dual final time I will be coming here. n n1st they now charge 1 per person for tea, which normally I wouldn't mind, I understand tea gets expensive and can add up. But the jasmine tea tasted like hot water with a hint of color to it, no Jasmine taste what so ever. n nService is slow and servers all looked unhappy. I'm Chinese, and trust me I'm used to Asian restaurants with bad or no service, it just comes with dining at an Asian restaurant. Especially Chinese. But this has got to be the worst I've had in a long time. n nSat down, was asked what kind of tea would you like. Not aware 1 per person. I ordered the stream rice rolls with cilantro n green onion with the server. 15 minutes went by, not a single food cart. Entire restaurant 4 carts, steam cart, congee cart, miscellaneous food, and Chinese broccoli cart. The ladies were pushing them like the wheels were broken or something! Finally the stream cart came by. We ordered 8 dishes my Mom, boyfriend, n myself figured we load up since it took so long. The same cart with the same food came by 3 times after that, no new items. I asked for steamed tripe, and shrimp rice rolls and she looked around at the other carts and said ""I don't have it. "" n nI finally get my order of cilantro and green onion rice roll, only to see a plan ol' plate of steam rolls, no herb. I told the lady I wanted cilantro n green onion. She walked up to the waitress that I placed my order with and told her next time not to write the word white in the order, white means plan. The waitress then comes over to the table and says, ""the lady just started working a few days ago so she made the mistake. We have to make your another one. "" In the meantime, no other carts came by but the 4 carts that had nothing that sparked my interest. Asked for egg custard tarts, nothing. Not a single one to be found. As time pasted, I got more and more frustrated as I watched the lady bring out cilantro green onion rice rolls to all the other tables that were seated AFTER us! The table next to us had 5 orders of egg tarts delivered to their table. So I decided to place one order and ask for the check.we were fed up at this point. n nThe waitress took the check to tally up and added the order of egg custard to the bill. She came back and said 15 minutes wait for the egg tarts. So damn frustrated I said NO! I can't wait anymore, I have to leave now by now it's 90 minutes . She walked away, went up to the cashier, came back n said ok 6 minutes ok because she already added the tarts on your bill. I finally said fine and agreed. 15 minutes later.no tart in sight and the waitress kept dodging our table because she knew I was trying to get her attention. Finally got her attention and she went to get them. I felt played for a fool. n n 50 later and we were all still some what hungry. Because of this almost 2 hour lunch, I was almost late to work. n nNEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!",1
"A beautiful display of home decor items, many items of which replicate one of the suites at the Encore.all for purchase for those who have the funds! . Some of the decor is glitzy and glam, while other items are more serene and calming. I love browsing these kinds of stores. I'm always appreciative when they let me take pictures, although one of the store clerks gave me an evil eye.but didn't say anything about it.",2
"This is a locals heaven. The casino is easy to get in and out of, new, and the aquarium is great. the mermaid bar is awesome with great drink specials bucket of 5 Heineken for 10 bucks the air stream bowling is AWESOME! they have a great selection of restaurants although I've only eaten at Johnny Rockets. The only draw back is that the restaurants close super early, 10 30 on weekends which only leaves the cafe and we ate there yesterday and it was great food at a great price. had the fried chicken and potatoes and turkey w crann sandwich. if your an outdoors freak there's a HUGE Bass Pro shops attached to the casino.",2
"These guys basically don't want business from locals and their prices gouge tourists. They DO NOT allow any outside ammo forcing you to pay their prices, which are 25 for 50 rounds of 9mm! n nThe service is hit or miss. One person I spoke with was nice and helpful. Another salesperson was flat out rude. Even if the staff was great I wouldn't go there because of the extremely high prices and ridiculous policies. n nI would discourage anyone thinking about going here, especially local shooters. There are much better shooting ranges nearby, including The Range 702.",1
I could not be more disappointed by this place! I purchased a shampoo for the interior of my car because the sales guy said it would only take 20 minutes what a complete joke when it took over an hour. This would have been fine if the car was actually clean! When all was said and done my car still has dog hair on the backseat that I was able to get off with just a lint roller. I will not be going back.,1

No Bath Towels. n nSeems as though this hotel is just for looks. Lack of Customer Service.",1
"Well, I finnaly got the chance to ceck this place out. What a letdown. Figured I would go basic and order a Chicao Dog and Fries. Probably one of the worst chicao Dogs I have ever had and I did not like the oven baked fries at all. nNo poppy bun as I was told they either did not get delivered or they were stolen. That aside the brown crust was flaking off of the plain roll, like old bread does. The roll had already started coming apart before I could pick it up. Need less to say it quickly didintegrated as soon as I bit in. The pickle was limp and broken. This a small place that could do a good lunch business I suspect if quality was better. Oneother note, mop the floor every night and when no one is at the register send the cashier out to wipe off tables.I mean really! nI guess I will keep looking.",1

"Hmm. Ive actually stayed in this hotel many times during my stays in vegas but more so recently since the reno in 2008. The rooms are modern and fresh, the beds are comfortable, and the housekeeping don't seem to knock on the door at 9am on a sat morning! I hate when that happens. n nI mean I know its vegas and we hardly sleep but I need to catch at least 3 hours before I go again! n nThe bathrooms are clean, the hotel staff are nice, the hotel is pretty much in the middle of the strip with access to everything. n nI will def stay here again ",2
"Ventano may have the view, but their food isn't authentic italian. Their pasta is dried from a box and sauces as well. They don't even make their pesto. The bread comes from the same company as Capriotti's. For the price it's nice and the view can't be beat. Decor is pretty out of date as well. n nService wasn't good. Owner is rude and makes inappropriate comments to woman. Young staff and slow to get food.",1
"Had passed this place on our way to Hedary's Restaurant registered in our heads. Later the same evening after doing Hoover Dam, needed a snack. Samosa being a good snack thought about Samosa Factory. n nWith a name like that, Samosa should be the signature dish, right? That's what we thought. n nOrdered 2 sides 4 Vegetarian samosas as a take out rushed to hotel to relax enjoy the Samosas with some nice indian tea. What a let down! Good amount of filling, no doubt, but absolutely bland. No taste at all. Just boiled potatoes! Half a samosa consumed rest relegated to trash. n nDon't think we will be visiting this place again, nor recommend it to anyone. Thorough let down. n nWe are Indians as in Bombay nFrom Georgia nHere for week vacation",1
"Damn, just. damn. n nGreat, great deep dish pizza. Comparable to Chicago pizzas well, maybe better because is cheaper . n nThe waiting is long, but give them a credit cause its said on the menu 45min minimum waiting . Well, if you go with friends, just order some pitcher and wait for it having a nice conversation. n nI've been here twice, and just loved. the price is a bit out of the average cirty range, but its worth it. n nI would add that the price difference between the Original Sicilian Pan and the Suer Stuffed Pizza is not worth it. The super stuffed only comes with and extra layer of crust above the pizza. You get more by ordering a original sicilian with more toppings.",2
"I don't think I've ever been to a Nordstrom store in my life. But when I walked in here, I was just reminded of Bloomingdales. I think the people here are very helpful. I was looking at the bathing suit section and this saleswoman offered some wonderful help. Too bad the swimsuits just weren't my taste. Gosh, I think I love Nordstrom now that I'm going to go out of my way upstate!",2
"We love the Priory! n nI don't remember how we found this place, but I feel so lucky we did. A beautiful restoration of a lovely old building, the Priory is a comfortable, tasteful, beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city. We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating, plenty of help and advice for weary holiday travelers, always delivered with a smile. We will return to the Priory.",2
"I guess I can't really expect much from a quick italian food pick up joint in Las Vegas! I expected it to be decent, but it was so bland and just horrible for my palate. n nI got the special, the sausage and wild mushroom calzone needless to say the calzone looked like a baby rock and not even cooked on the exterior. I think the sausage and wild mushrooms have a good flavor, but the dough is what turned me off. There was about an inch and half of eatable calzone. The people working behind the counter were not too friendly, and I just wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. n nOverall, I will definitley not be coming back here!",1
"Totally outstanding service each time I visit. GREAT FOOD. Everything comes together. Really great spot. n nBianca was really good on two occasions, personal, professional, and good at all areas. n nMy only gripe was when we paid compliments to the manager he seemed disinterested and like ""yeah, okay. "" when it would have been nice to hear something like ""really? great to hear, I'll let her know "". Recognition is always important. n noh, and sometimes I found dirty silverware rolled up minus one star. kind of gross.",2
"Has most of what we need, however I'd rather go to the safeway up the street. The pizza at bashas is inexpensive and pretty decent, regular groceries and butchery stuff seams to be a bit more than the safeway but quality is always good. n nExcept for the one check out lady who was grumpy once, this place hasn't disappointed me since. Well they don't carry blue bunny ice cream sandwiches which is a shame.",2
They don't provide parking at the bus station. This is something they don't tell you until after you buy your non refundable ticket and they put it in the fine print at the bottom of the page so you are sure to miss it. n nAlso my return bus was an hour late. nThe internet doesn't work. n nTwo stars because its cheep and you really shouldn't expect much.,1
"Lovveeddd it! nWe wanted to go somewhere that had a nice interior, good vibe, and of course delicious food for our Montreal trip and this place was perfect. nWe booked a reservation and came in around 9pm. Ordered a bottle of red, can't remember what but it was quite good. My boyfriend and I split 4 mains and it was the perfect amount of food. nCod w Potatoe Puree The cod was perfectly fried and crispy on the outside and soft and fresh on the inside. It was surrounded by a potato puree je pense and some chili oil? Really good! nCotechino It's some kind of cooked sausage salami thing. It was definitely really tasty, but I guess I could've gone for something more adventurous. nGrilled Octopus One large octo leg, grilled well and soft on the side. nLamb w Pears It didn't look like lamb, looked like more of a pork terrine type thing. I loved it though, it came with pears and a cream sauce. n nOur friends got a couple things which I'm not sure I can remember well. One was the charcuterie which looked very cute. The meats didn't look particularly exotic and the portions looked small. Not sure if they were happy with this. Also they didn't seem to like the Tuna tartare dish and left half uneaten which cause the the waiter to scoff. He was nice up until that point, but that was weird. Also, it took almost 2 hours for all our food to come out so I had to take a point off. n nWould I be back? Might go back to MTL just for this.",2
"This was my first time hear, had no idea what to order, so I asked the waitress. I went with all her recommendations and it couldn't have been better. Started off with the ""wedge "" salad, which I have never been a fan of wedge salads, but I ate every last bit. The bacon and blue cheese dressing were enough to make me want to like my plate clean. Then had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12 year aged Balsamic and the mac and cheese. n nIf you go you HAVE to have the Mac and Cheese with Lobster, it is to die for! My boyfriend kept raving about it, and to be honest I didn't really believe him. Not until I took that first bite, I was done for! All the flavors just melt in your mount and bland into this amazing deliciousness, really it's that good.",2
"These rooms are just huge. We booked a regular suite through priceline for 100, when we checked in they upgraded us to an even larger suite because we had an amex card. That room was so amazing. It was bigger than some of the places I've lived in. The living room was huge seemed like a lot of extra space though , we could have put 50 people in there comfortably. The view from the room was incredible as well.I will definitely be back.",2
"As far as the authenticity of the food by far the best anywhere in Champaign Urbana, wife and I ordered baby squid in basil sauce and the peking pork, the squid was cooked perfectly and spiced perfectly. The peking pork was fried to perfection and the sauce was very tasty. They have updated their menus so that the good stuff can be read in English now. Their dim sum is pretty standard items, but the only real place to go in Champaign, myself I would probably wait till I get back to Chicago for that. nThe down side of this place is their are two waitress that also work in the kitchen, everything is self serve the tea, drinks, even your utensils. So do not come here expecting great service, but all in all the most authentic chinese restaurant in Champaign!",2
"Rosita's is better than Macayo's that's not saying much , less commercial and more traditional AZ mex. It is decent, but they over cheese everything. Their food tends to be a bit greasy and overpriced, however the salsa is excellent. The menu is humongous and they cater which is nice when you forget it's mexican potluck day at work The service has always been fast, friendly and very attentive. nI'm knocking it down to 2 stars because on last two visits the sewer smell remember that smell from Long Wong's. permeated the entire restaurant and I just about lost my appetite which is not good when you are paying 8.95 for a freaking burrito .",1
"Went here per recommendation from a couple friends. Ordered the special grinder and was hoping for something special. Once I got home and took a bite, I was sorely disappointed with the seasoning. The sandwich was really bland and didn't taste like anything. Will try them one more time for their cheesesteakes, but will stop patronizing them after that. Real disappointment.",1
"Outstanding food and service. Portions are large, enough for 2 meals. Save room for the most amazing dessert ever!",2
"Service was good, fast, and friendly food was okay and prices are fair, but nothing special overall. Admittedly, Middle Eastern food is not my favorite cuisine, but I've had some very flavorful chicken kabobs and shawarma ELSEWHERE that I really enjoyed. Not so much here. n nThe menu is pretty basic consisting of mainly sandwiches, kabobs, falafel, and humus. There was no shawarma to be found. n nSo I had a chicken kabob. The chicken tasted like it had been marinated in salty dishwater. It came with a generous portion of rice and a salad that had a couple of tomato wedges, a slice of cucumber, and lots of feta cheese. Filling, but nothing I will be in a hurry to go back for. Also, while not expensive, 14.99 for the above mediocre meal didn't exactly seem like a bargain either. n nBottom line my one meal here seemed bland and slightly overpriced compared to what I've had at other Middle Eastern restaurants. However, the hummus was good, so maybe it's worth trying something else another time.",1
"Cheap rates for a cheaper hotel on the strip. The shape of the place is really cool and when in the hotel elevators, it is very evident that you are not in a typical elevator that goes straight up and down. However, because of the layout of the place, everywhere smells like smoke! Even in the hallways of the hotel room. The rooms need renovations as it is an older hotel, but you get what you pay for. Would I stay here again? Probably not.",1
Take a Xanax if your prone to anxiety attacks from being around a cluster of people. Front of store gives me that cattle like feeling. But overall there is some pretty good deals here on bulk stuff ,2
"This place was the only restaurant around that was open on a Sunday for brunch. At first thought, I thought it was pretty cute.but then I realized it was sort of a set up for tourists and I was a sucker. n nIf the food blew me away I wouldn't have cared how cheesy the plastic slabs of meat hanging in the window were! But sadly, my Apple Brie Turkey Sandwich came without the apple. I was disappointed because the apple is what makes it. am I right?",1
"I am absolutely tired of trying to purchase a vehicle with Carmax. We are 7 hours into our day with them. We started the paperwork process 3 days ago with an appraisal that took ALL DAY. nWhat should have been a quick fax to our bank today turned into 'well, it'll be an hour'. an hour turned into 2, into 3. We left our bank because we couldn't wait any longer. Now 7 hours later we are waiting for the car to be washed so we can just leave. n nIt's absolutely ridiculous! They obviously have no appreciation for our business and I wouldn't buy here again. n nGail was awful!",1
"Back again for Giants Spring Training and one again it was excellent. Greg was our server and he was ON IT with the refills! The only bummer is we had to wait 20 minutes for a table but hey thats not their fault. n nGreat food, good fun .",2
"Ok. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing here. I dunno. But I was NOT pleased. Not at all. n nI am from LA and I know Mexican. And this place is not Mexican. It's something like what Midwesterners want Mexican to be. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the the Fish tacos were served with a Chipotle Mayo type thing. Yuck. That is not authentic. n nSo I ordered the Sopa de Tortilla. A dish I love to order in Mexican restaurants. Not terrible, but not balanced and it really tasted only like a bowl of chili. Eh. n nThen my friend ordered the 6 taco platter and I tried the Rajas and Mushroom tacos. Blech. No flavor. Plus and I hate when restaurants do this although the menu stated the Rajas Tacos came with Queso Fresco versus just queso , when it came it was melted Jack Cheese. That is not Queso Fresco. I guess they don't expect people to know the difference! n nThe only reason I am giving the 2 stars and not 1 is because their house made salsa was pretty good. Thank god for that, because it was the only way to flavor the tacos!",1
"Like many others, I think this is one of the best boba spots in Vegas, if not the best. These are big words from me because I'm a huge fan of 1 Boba House is that what it's still called? inside the Chinatown Mall. n nFirst of all, the drinks are great. The staff is really nice and accommodating to any special requests you may have. This is something spectacular in terms of the boba world, at least in Vegas. Since most spots are in Chinatown service is just unheard of. But not here. They're definitely onto something. n nI can't speak for their food, but for drinks this is just not even a question. Boba and service in one place who would have thought? Now if only it wasn't so North.",2
"A great place for a late night dinner. I absolutely love tapas and the food here was not bad at all. But I do have to say I wish our server told us while we were ordering that this so called small plates were not that small. Coming from SF I really expect SMALL plates. Dinner for 8 was super cheap 150 and that is with alcohol and we were stuffed. n nWe had the white sangria.it was yummy tasted like juice. I seriously think we over ordered. We had the tuna tartare, sliders, calamari, ceviche, paella and a bunch of other stuff. Everything was pretty good and once again the prices were great. I would definitely come back again if time allows the next time I come back to Vegas.",2
"I received a flyer in the mail for a good deal on brake service from Infiniti of Peoria. I'm not much for handing off my car to others and do most of my own maintenance, but I thought the deal was decent plus I wanted to give some local guys a fair shake. n nI had the rear brake pads replaced and the rotors machined for 200 and an alignment for 99. They were also kind enough to do a 31 point inspection just for kicks. It's the inspection report that I find difficult to chew on. n nThe following are a few quotes from the dealer provided report n nObservation Found cabin Hepa micro filter dirty nRecommendation Replace cabin HEPA micro filter n nObservation Found automatic transmission fluid to be contaminated burnt nRecommendation Perform automatic transmission fluid exchange service n nObservation Found coolant to be in poor condition or contaminated nRecommendation Perform coolant fluid exchange service n nObservation Found rear differential fluid to be dirty contaminated nRecommendation Perform rear differential service n nThese were just a few observations from the report. Just over 500 bucks for these services. Actually, all of the report observations and services totaled over 3000. n nThe rub as mentioned above, I do much of my own work on the car. Just a few weeks earlier, for example, I had replaced the HEPA filter myself and it was essentially brand new. Dirty automatic transmission fluid? Well the car has a manual transmission and I serviced it in the recent past with synthetic gear oil and at the same time serviced the rear differential with the same brand synthetic. When I replaced the gear oil in the transmission and differential, I was pleased to see how clear and clean it was. I also replaced the crush washers as per the FSM. Poor condition or contaminated coolant? The coolant was replaced in the recent past as I had to replace a faulty thermostat. n nEthically challenged tactics to say the least. Beware the fact that they really don't perform inspections.",1
"Huuge fan of the Cracked Egg! I've gone on weekend and weekday mornings. Weekday mornings aren't too bad, but weekend days can have quite the wait sometimes 30 40 mins . I either get the California omelette or the mexican skillet, depending on my mood. Both are just too delicious. I love their seasonsed potatoes! Their portions are more than enough for me, unless I'm absolutely starving. This is so much better than your Dennys and IHOPs. Fresh and a wide variety of food, and the prices aren't bad at all. The toast always has plenty of butter, and their coffee cake is yummy as well. I've been here more than I count, and it never gets old.",2
"Booked two rooms here with one room receiving housekeeping clean towels, bed fix etc once in three days after numerours complaints to reception.",1
"I've tried really hard to like this place, but they mess my order up two out of three times and then act like jerks when I ask them to fix it. I'm never rude, mistakes happen, but geez get it right!",1
"If I was sober I'd have more to say.but I have memories of delicious smells, tastes, and textures. n nSeriously though.I was wasted.I mean, it was amazing.",2
"Two words UNLIMITED BOOZE! n nHowever, the food here is whatever considering for a similar price I can go to bachannal or wicked spoon. The food here is pretty in the middle for me. My favorite thing are the king crab legs, prime rib and salmon. However, a lot of the food here were stale or utter failures. I am surprised I didn't break my teeth on the garlic bread here or macarons. Pretty much, some stuff were super cold and old and they just leave it there. they need to do a better job of switching stuff out. n nHowever, they have goose island ipa, a solid cab, chard and a solid dessert zinfadel. I hate to admit but the drinks here outrank the food. Compared to the above listed buffets, the desserts here were just miserable. Nothing tasted amazing. If not for my buy one get one free, I would never try this buffet. n nJust save yourselves the money and go to bachannal.",1
"Surprisingly quite except for our table on the Friday before the ACC championship game. nI would imagine this place would be hopping after work! The atmosphere was great for the young crowd to hang out. nMost had the filet, I had the lamb, and one other the salmon. All were cooked to perfection except the lamb. It was a bad cut with lots of gristle that I couldn't even cut through, so three sizable pieces couldn't be eaten. nThe Tiramisu Chocolate Martini was with the whole trip to Charlotte! We may have ordered a few extra of those.",2
"This is definitely a hidden neighborhood gem. It reminds me of Haji Baba in Tempe part grocery store, part delicious eats. n nThe gentleman behind the counter presumably the owner? was extremely friendly and welcoming. n nWe ordered the chicken kabobs and the vegetarian platter which included hummus, falafel and the eggplant dip which I won't even attempt to spell. The chicken was juicy, flavorful and delicious. The peppers that accompanied it were cooked to perfection as well. The hummus was tahini rich which makes it a winner for me. They top it with a spicy green sauce which I thought was an interesting twist but the husband did not care for it too much. The falafel and eggplant dip were delicious as well. We ended our meal with baklava. I don't know if it's made in house we think maybe not but either way, it's delicious. n nIf you need to stock up on tahini, this is the place to do it. It's fun to poke around in the grocery area while waiting for your food. n nWonderful experience and we will defiitely be back!",2
"Car dealerships tend to get bad ratings. They are well known for their pushy sales and secret tactics no doubt about that. n nI purchased my Hyundai when this dealership was under different ownership. The sales process was like any other dealership. But I know what I'm doing and knew what I wanted. n nI love my vehicle. Service dept used to be great. They had a service director there Tim who was excellent and worked as an advisor for years. n nNow I go in for warranty work and they simply don't treat you with the respect I used to know. They have good points but bad ones too. Even an oil change takes forever ! No dealership is great but the service dept is what keeps a customer a customer. Unorganized and have an attitude. I would be even more mad if it wasn't warranty work and it came from my pocket. n nSadly it seems like other local Hyundai service depts are this way too. Infiniti, Acura, honda are all excellent in the service dept. Earnhardt Hyundai needs to take lessons from them.",1
"Sooo. Me and my friends all went on grand opening night. Granted it was kind of crowded but the service was awful! I work in customer service and I guess I just thought during their grand opening they would have gone out of their way to have the best customer service ever so that people would come back but that definitely was NOT the case! I was ignored at the bar multiple times at multiple bars, it was awful. And to add insult to injury when a bartender would even acknowledge that we were sitting there they were so rude and acted like we were bothering them when u would think they would appreciate us spending money in there place I guess not",1
"I love this place but this time around it treated me very wrong , Came there with a group of 12 had 5 rooms rented 4 of us showed up at 2pm and the rest of our party showed up at 9 45 pm . the room was under our friends name who attends this hotel often and even with him on the phone verifying who he was and giving us permission to enter a room we offered a credit card would not let us check in. we had to purchase another room and told that when our hosts arrived that we would be refunded our money likely! Because we had reserved so many rooms and just transferred to there bill. Not the case at all we were not allowed to check our bags because we were not the renters on the agreement. So we rented a room to change in thinking that we would just stay in the room when our hosts arrived at the rate arranged per our hosts. Not the case charged full price and treated very rudely when trying to organize the chaos. we werent looking for a free place just to check in an hour early. we had the host on the phone with the manager giving us permission to check in with credit card used to reserve the rooms also a vip player by there standards and still we were forced to rent another room on top the 5 we reserved . I gotta say i love this property but we were here for a good time and i spent the first 3 hrs of my vacation bickering back and forth with front desk. Then when our hosts arrived we spent another 45 minutes with vip services and they flat out said sorry do you want the rooms you reserved or not.i know it was a busy weekend i understand we were there to have a good time we werent rude due to most of us being in the service industry we just wanted to have fun and enjoy our surroundings at a price we had agreed upon. We were treated poorly and it totally bums me out because we have had so much fun here in the past. our group of 12 spent a significant amount of money here AGAIN! But i think in the future we will look elsewhere due to the fake promises and outlandish rules",1
"For a Saturday morning breakfast, I can't think of anything better. Soon after this little joint opened, a friend said to me, ""You HAVE to try this new waffle place! "" But I was on my way just as soon as I heard the word ""waffle. "" n nThese are not, I repeat, NOT like Waffle House. They're Belgian Liege waffles. super dense, chewy they're made with dough instead of batter, and imbedded in the final product are crystallized sugar pearls. n nYour best bet for a top notch waffle is going at a busy time.you'll have a bit of a wait, but tasting a freshly ironed ? waffle is worth it. At non peak hours, expect that you'll be served a waffle that was made a few minutes ago. n nThey have an old school coke machine that you put quarters in. It's a bit tricky, so take the advice of the staff and pull it out quick! n nGreat spot for breakfast meetings, and they offer free wi fi. Apparently their coffee is highly regarded by the readers of Creative Loafing. It's not my favorite, but when you need something warm and delicious to wash down your waffle, it's never a bad choice. n nThere's a TV at the bar, so you can watch something if you're not keen on conversation. Outdoor seating is a plus, when the weather's nice. I always park in the bank parking lot and walk over. It's easier than parallel parking next to the shop. n nDefinitely go for the ""Extra Sweet "" variety with maple butter, sans the powdered sugar. Nothing gets me out of bed on a Saturday morning like the thought of that waffle.",2
"Thorough workouts, every session is different, plenty of encouragement and positive attitude!",2
"After visiting this place a few more times, they have improved. The service has been great, and the food has been consistently better than before. Now really my only complaint is the three pages of rules that govern their frequent diners card. Every other place I eat at often you get a stamp per entree you purchase, and you can combine cards. The Good Egg is a little more picky, and only gives one stamp per visit, and you cannot combine cards.",2
A solid spot for burrito's! All the staple items with fresh ingredients and great offers. Tuesday Thursday!,2
"We were here last night and bought some cupcakes. They were dry, not all that yummy, and 2 cost 9 dollars. Seriously disappointed with this experience because I have heard and seen so much about this place and was really thinking it was going to be awesome. Maybe the candy is better but Im not much of a candy person, I like my cake.",1
First time Korean BBQ in Vegas and this place was good. Excellent service and lots of choices. Meat was really good. Some needed a little more flavor but just dipped it in there sauces. I would definitely go back.,2
"The last time we ate at Houston's, we waited 90 minutes for a table. They had quoted 45. We complained. They told us ""just five to ten more minutes "" a few times. I was super hungry and expected something to be comped. Anything. I guess they didn't feel the same. n nAnd let's not kid ourselves the food is just okay. I'm convinced people eat at Houston's because it's at the Biltmore, everyone wears their church clothes, and the decor is pretty nice. Dining here makes you feel like you have money, even though it's not very expensive. Or maybe that's just me.",1
"OMG. This place is heaven. My friend who is a local, had planned to take me here for breakfast before dropping me at the airport. Now I had been entertaining clients the night prior and may or may not have had too many martinis. So I may or may not have been seriously hungover. Which could explain why I took a picture of my coffee cup see pictures . The coffee was quite a welcome taste. NOT ""bad diner coffee "". I ordered Eggs Benedict and yes AND plain buttermilk pancakes. OMG. Everything was perfection. The food is a thrill soooo delicious. My friend said they don't have hashbrowns as you can see in the picture, you get potato pancakes. Yummy. I did NOT even peruse the menu but I could see they have TONS of pancakes, omelets, and pretty much every breakfast concoction you can imagine. Honestly I'll be here EVERY TIME I am in Vegas for a cheat day of course. Yea, I'm one of those fitness freaks that watches what I eat 80 of the time, so this is a cheat meal in a big way. So worth it.",2
"There is one reason why I gave this place the extra star, the food here is excellent, although I do suggest getting it to go due to the lack of good service. But I'd rather spend my money elsewhere where the business cares about the customer, afterall we are the reason they stay open. nWaiters waitresses need to know their boundaries as to what type of remarks to have to say to their guests. Obviously in this atmosphere neither their front of house staff nor the owner cares what we think of how they treat us. I had invited my best friend here for a lovely lunch and instead had an overall bad experience. We were very disappointed in the service and how the owner handled it. nI just won't be returning.",1
The salesperson I had today was so rude. I will certainly think twice before going back. The drive to the Shoebox is not that bad and there is always Zappos.,1
"This hookah lounge is just that, a lounge. It has very comfortable chairs and couches. There is a lot of room to spread out and get comfortable. This is a very important factor for Hookah lounges because you are smoking and trying to relax. n nSecondly, the staff is fantastic. They are very attentive. When you need coals they are right there asking you how the hookah is and if the flavor is still prime. If you feel like talking they will sit down for a couple minutes and chat with you, but they are quick to get back to work. n nThirdly, the prices are fantastic. They have food and drinks for sale at this lounge and the prices are unbeatable. The food is incredibly good as well. n nIf you're looking for a cheap, relaxing, and fun hookah lounge to frequent, this is the one for you!",2
"Didn't like it, but we have the best Mexican in Dallas so I am biased. n nThe margaritas were decent. Salsa was ehh, just had brisket tacos for apps.Cute patio. Live music, as in the guy with guitar singing ""la bamba! "" n nWouldn't go back. Crowd was kind of boring. Other places along Scottsdale Blvd looked way more lively.",1
Visiting Tempe and was just walking off dinner and decided to stop in for a beer. Wound up smoking a good cigar and having a few pints. Very friendly staff,2
"Our hotel had a little guide to Vegas on the nightstand and as I scoured it for free and or interesting things to do, the Interactive Rock Wall caught my eye as something my musician husband would enjoy. While it's impressive in theory, the more interesting and fun techie toy we found was just in the waiting area. It was a table top touch screen, reminiscent of the old pac man tables often found in restaurants during the 80s 90s, but WAY MORE AWESOME. er, well, those were pretty sweet too. n nI'm drifting. n nSo the interactive rock wall has random images of memorabilia floating around which you can drag and touch click and enlarge. and is quite large, with basically 6 docking stations for 6 users to peruse the floating options. However, the table top touch screens had a search feature so you could choose whose junk you got to look at. We immediately searched for the Boss's items in the collection, enjoying the i whatever type technology that allowed us to pinch and spread our fingers on the screen to zoom in and out and read old setlists and the like. n nFun times for music geeks. n nI believe these are the same kinds of screens we saw in the booths, but our table didn't have one to play with. so if you want to enjoy that part of the place, ask specifically to sit near one! n nOh yeah and as far as the food went, it was fine, just as at all Hard Rocks, although I give extra props to the waitress who noticed me order my veggie burger without cheese and asked if I was vegan. n n Side note, vegans, don't plan to eat here. There's really nothing for you. That veggie burger had cheese in it, and I was so grateful that she let me know! The option for a side salad is there, but it won't really fill you. with food or nutrients since it was all iceberg or other light colored lettuces with practically no vitamins.",2
"Great steaks from the butcher, too.",2
love this place.you know its a real Japanese place when actual Japanese perple eat there.lol all I have to say is they have amazing food and good service!,2
"What a beautiful display of white and dark chocolate flowing from carefully engineered platters of glass. Seeing this was truly intriguing. I mean, the way the platters were shaped caused the chocolate to flow down in a curved manner. So cool. Anyways, as I walked around the small shop, I pondered about what I might like to try besides everything. They had beautiful displays of everything. Seeing all those artfully designed cakes was like watching the completion of a food network competition. Okay, so I didn't try any of the delectable looking desserts, but I did have gelato. I love gelato and while I thought this gelato would be different, it wasn't. I ordered a mint chocolate chip gelato and it tasted really creamy and still delicious so I was still satisfied. My sister ordered the berry gelato and said it tasted like fruit roll up brings back child like memories. Now that I think about it, I wish I'd tried at least one of those chocolate desserts. Oh well, there's always next time.",2
"Jimmy Joe's ruined Christmas 2014. I had been a loyal customer for many years and my family and many friends will never give them another penny. They advertised a special to buy gift certificates and did not specify that that there were only a certain amount. I went in the day they said to, and they told me they were sold out. The ad did not say to get there by a certain time or that there were a limited amount. I had planned to use these gift certificates as Christmas gifts and instead I had to find alternate gifts and will tell those friends and everyone I can never to eat there. Note to Groupon buyers. when you use a Groupon at Jimmy and Joe's they use only half as many ingredients on the toppings as a non Groupon pizza. You do not get a bargain with a Groupon at this pizza place, you get a skimpy poorly made pizza.",1
"Always the best , can't beat chipotle",2
"I have been to Ti Amo several times over the years and it never fails to deliver. n nSituated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street, Ti Amo is just across the road from the main University campus George Square and it is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach. n nThe decor inside is very authentic Italian, with Italian music playing in the background which gives the restaurant a great atmosphere. It looks quite small from the outside, but the restaurant is on two floors so it is very spacious inside and has a large capacity so it would be an ideal place for a big group of people. n nTi Amo offer a very extensive menu with authentic Italian dishes, including pizzas, pastas, risotto and a good selection of different meat dishes. I had the marinated olives to start when I came here which were really tasty, and too oily which was good. But my main course was by far the superior dish. I had the Four Seasons pizza which was absolutely gorgeous. The pizza base was really thin and perfectly cooked without any burnt bits and they didn't skimp on the topping and cheese, which always gets a bug thumbs up from me. The portion sizes are really decent and the prices are really reasonable too with most main course costing about u00a37. n nThe staff are really friendly and accommodating and make you feel that nothing is too much trouble for them amazing! A great Italian restaurant which I am definitely going back to.",2
"I came here on a recommendation from a friend. n nThe place is clean, staff is very friendly. n nI guess i expected more. n nThe sandwich was ok. Nothing to write home about. n nSorry but I like Capriotti's much better.",1
"This is my third attempt to get services set up. I received a referral through another utility. Granted, it will save me about 100 month over my current provider but I am beginning to think it's not worth it. Each time I am told my services and install date have been set only to be told by the next person it has not happened. Of course each new person can not tell me why I was told it was done.",1
"The burger menu was disappointingly small. You'd think for a place called ""Burgr "" they'd have more than 6 I think burgers to choose from. I wasn't in love with any of the burger descriptions on the menu, but I got the blue cheese one and it was excellent. Cooked to perfection as well! We got the truffle fries to share for the table and they were pretty good, but I would've preferred just regular fries. n nThe milkshake though. Oh man I devoured that thing. My boyfriend and I got the banana snickerdoodle one to share but it was SO good I drank most of it. It had custard in it, whipped cream, and topped with a thin cookie. I would come here and wait in line just to get a shake, it was that great. n nThe first time I came here I got the hummus snack plate. Very impressed with the bread and vegetables and it was refreshing to see a healthy starter item in the menu that wasn't a salad. n nService was a little slow both the times I was here, but it was really packed both times. Very cool atmosphere as well, I like how you can see the cooks in the kitchen, like the perspective of Ramsey's tv shows.",2
First time at the new location. Food was just as fabulous as the other locations in Vegas. Service was great and we were checked on regularly. The Carnitas tacos are my favorite. Next time looking forward to sit in the bar area to enjoy the beautiful view of the city!,2
Did this girl really just grab my food with her bare hands? I threw my food out. Disgusting! Do not eat here!,1
"Was there recently for a bridal shower and was not impressed by the service. Granted I know serving a large party can be difficult, plus one of the servers said she was very new maybe don't put a new server in a large party? . We kept trying to order drinks, cocktails, coffee, water it didn't matter you had to ask at least twice if you really wanted it and even then it would take over 20 minutes to get things. We had a pre selected menu to choose from and everything from it was fine the walnut salad was the best thing on the menu, really good. The buffalo chicken wrap was okay. But it all would have been lovely if the service would have been better faster, especially since it was just a lot of drinks and there were only a few choices for food!",1
"Great easygoing place, no gimmicks, where neighbourhood people hang out. n nNot too noisy or touristy just right. Doesn't get too crowded or in your face like many other area spots. n nQu u00e9bec microbrews, good selection of other stuff, friendly banter, good background music and nice relaxed vibe. n nBig screen goes on for Habs game.",2
"I really liked this hotel casino. The casino was large, clean, and had a good amount of machines, tables, and a sports book. Buffet for breakfast was a good deal at 16 dollars, and was quite extensive. I stayed at the nearby Vdara but my friend's room seemed pretty nice except for the bizzaro tv mounted on a random pillar in the room . n nWe walked all over the strip but ended up just doing most of our gaming here because it was convenient and accessible. n nRecommended.",2
Great Thai spot!,2
"What a mess of a hotel. I guess that maybe I grew up in an era where the Marriott name meant class and luxury. nI can't blame Marriott for the fact that the hotel was hosting the Little Miss Jon Benet America contest. The hotel was overran with 6 year olds wearing make up and donning skimpy outfits. It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. nThe hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. nAnd the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott Madison West. I couldn't check out of that hotel fast enough. nIn the future, I would rather stay at a hotel with sticky sheets, that rents it's rooms by the hour than ever stay at a Marriott again.",1
Skip it,1
"NOT A DELI! Its a glorified sandwich shop. Went there for bacon and eggs one morning only to find out they don't serve it. Had a sunrise breakfast sandwich. same sandwich from burger king was better and cheaper. Don't be mislead by the word ""deli "". Order and sit down. counter staff was not friendly and cooks were loud and didn't seem to care about the image, but, I was the only one in the place mid morning.",1
"I brought home some really good cheese steaks from this location. I've tried the other location at happy valley, but somehow it tasted better this time.",2
"Went to the new location yesterday and it was very nice! Organized, clean, and had a HUGE selection. I don't know how anyone can even go through all the racks there! You will definitely find something there. nI give it two starts though because the service was HORRIBLE! They had 5 employees I counted and not one greeted me, asked if I needed help or even acknowledged me. They were either talking to each other or on their phones. I stood by the dressing room waiting to try on clothes and no one helped me until I walked up to the counter and asked if I could use a room. She didn't even say anything to me, just walked over, unlocked the room and walked away. Definitely not a customer orientated store. Overall. Great store with a lot of merchandise but horrible unfriendly staff!",1
"Cute neighborhood spot. Love the patio! Pet friendly. Great go to for any meal of the day, but especially brunch and happy hour. Friendly staff.",2
"Worst theatre ever. No wonder they are willing to only charge 5 for a ticket.

Oh and our ""tables "" or shall I say ""linoleum office cabinets "". What the heck?!? Oh and get this! The lights to illuminate your food aren't really blue, THEY ARE WHITE WITH BLUE PAINTERS TAPE OVER THEM! Most ghetto theatre I have ever been sat in. I'll never go back and hope I get a good theatre.",1
"Diceman! What happened? n nYou have the energy, the biker attire, and the attention of all those little kids who loved you in your prime and are now old enough to see you in Vegas. And you have my money 100 ticket for good seats Vinyl in Vegas . n nBut, your routine is dated and too scripted. Your references aren't funny now. Really, you are going to poke fun at fancy Starbucks drinks in 2014? Come on, that is so 10 years ago. n nMight also suggest losing the opening act. She is too much like a younger and female version of you who doesn't have the right delivery. She even told some of the same jokes. n nYeah, you still rock out the nursery rhymes, and you have a great delivery of some kick ass jokes. But man, freshen up your act, make it a little longer, and interact with the audience like you actually mean it. You will pack the house!",1
"I've eaten from here a number of times during my college years. Last time I ordered the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. The garlic naan was nice and warm with plenty of garlic bits and good garlic flavor. The chicken tikka masala was nicely seasoned with spices and a good amount of chicken chunks. Definitely a satisfying meal. While the food is delicious it is a bit on the pricey side for college students like me. Worth it yes, but not something to eat regularly on a college budget. n nThis location has a buffet which the Green Street location doesn't, but I can't comment on the buffet, although I've heard good things. Also this location seems to have slightly higher prices than the Green Street location. Probably due to the better ambiance in comparison.",2
ive never waited for more than 20 mins at a fast food burger place. i kept telling my wife that it was a good sign and that it just means that the food will be super fresh. not so much. the fries were prob reheated at least twice as they looked old and the burger meat was on the cold side as well. ill just stick to freddys or in n out!,1
"While I was in town, I wanted see what all the hype was about and it definitely was worth it! n nMeat Potatoes is a must on your list for any night out. n nI headed out with a few of my gal pals, and we had so much fun. The food was amazing, the drinks were fantastic. I'm always a little weary about drinking beer out of a can, but it was okay with the atmosphere. n nThe Fried Pickles were spectacular as was the Kobe Corn Dog it just sounds intriguing, right? The Mac 'n Cheese was excellent too hello, chorizo! n nMy only complaint was that we had reservations, and we had to wait for another 30 minutes and there were open tables. Not sure what was going on.but worth the wait. n nOverall, awesome evening in my book.",2
"Yum, all I can say is YUM. Finally a small mom and pop store that sells authentic chinese noodles that actually taste good! n nWe ordered n1 Beef Stew Soup Noodle lamian wide noodles. Its a hearty, rich soup. Noodles are perfectly cooked, light and chewy goodness! Remember good korean chinese noodles should have a bite, not soggy or too soft! n n2 Pork Chop Rice the pork was not greasy at all, the ran out of rice so they gave up a bowl of vegetable broth with bok choy and regular noodles. The broth was very very light had a slight hint of an onion taste! n n3 Zha Jian lamian wide noodles. Its the orginal version of a korean chachang myeun. Sooo refreshing with the cucumbers lbean sprouts! This was my fav! n n4 Boiled Dumpling chives mmmm tastes like my mom's homemade dumpling. Chives shrimp chunks. n n5 Meat cold dish combination marinated tripe, pork, tendon. The sauce they used has a nice, slight spiciness to compliment the meats. n nOverall, my bf, friends and I would definitely come back here. We can't believe this place opened up last november. Also, you know they use real ingredients not msg when you walk out without being thirsty n nI've always been a supporter of mom and pop stores this store deserves an A !",2
I really had high hope for the Groupon for 2 for 1 gel or shellac manicure. Let's just say I won't be returning.,1
"I had visited the Grand Spa some years ago and had a wonderful experience. This past November, I booked a massage and facial through the concierge prior to my trip. I was contacted so that I could provide my credit card number to book the services. I was told there was a 2 hour cancellation policy. When I arrived, I received a written confirmation of the second scheduled service, the facial. but not the massage. In the early morning hours of the next day, I contacted the concierge about the fact that I had not received confirmation of the first service and received assurance that it was scheduled. So, I went to the spa and checked in and sat waiting for my massage. I was not called at the appointed hour and when I went to the desk to ask they told me the massage had been booked but not placed on the schedule. I didn't want to wait around for the facial and was quite irritated by how I was treated by the manager. She refused to refund my money for the facial. I went to the concierge and was told that it was a ""glitch in the system "" and she couldn't do anything to get the facial refunded. I explained that had the concierge TOLD me in the morning when I called that the massage was not on the schedule I would have cancelled the facial within the 2 hour limit. The concierge repeated told me that there was a glitch in the system and she was sorry. In no uncertain terms I told her that a glitch in their system is not my problem. n A few hours later, I received a call advising me that the full amount would be refunded and there would be no spa charge on my credit card. No charges came through in November. HOWEVER, when I got my December AMEX statement they had slipped the charge for the facial back onto my card. One month later. After telling me I wouldn't be charged. DO NOT PATRONIZE THE GRAND SPA AND IF YOU DO CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT CAREFULLY.",1
"this place rocks and absolutely has a girl on the go's idea in mind. whisked in, got the full oil treatment. glad they didn't try to ""coax "" me into other optional services like ""show me my air filter once again "",i got your numbers boys and brought my own clean one in ahead of time and installed it on my car, so no playing me . that's their job to sell things, i understand, but i was treated after the fact as always with the utmost respect, did my oil change in record time and i was on my way. man they were fast and really kind to a girl like me. ps the wonderful guys said anytime i needed a belt changed, to just show up and they'd do it no problems asked. whohooo! what else could a girl ask for?",2
"Expensive. Food is just 'OK.' We had the pastrami, Reuben, and Dads Favorite brisket on a roll . Meh. Portions were small and pricey. Slaw and pickles were pretty good. Their cheesecake is authentic flown in from NYC? and a ""must do "" if you decide to go here. I would only return if I was in need of cheesecake but you can get that in several other places, too. Otherwise. I make a better pastrami or Reuben at home!",1
"Well, we will never go back and let me tell you why. n nI actually liked the decorations. I am not a hunter and personally I can't stand it and don't get it BUT I can appreciate that is a hobby for some. n nI just couldn't get past how bad the service and food was! We spend almost 100 for 2 people and it wasn't worth 50. n nI ordered the filet and it comes with veggies and a starch. Well I asked if I could have just all veggies and the server says ""I will have to check with the chef to see if we can make an exception. We don't normally allow that "". Uhhhh I'm sorry if my dietary restrictions are just too much for the chef! Really, how hard is it to just leave off the potato and add extra broccoli? nWe order and then wait, and wait, and wait. it took almost an hour to get our food. At one point the server came by and asked if they could butterfly my steak so it would cook faster. I said that was fine but when the food actually came out they didn't even butterfly my steak. My steak was burnt to a crisp. I mean WELL done. I ordered it medium. If you are going to have ""Steakhouse "" in your name then cooking a steak correctly would be a start. nAlso, I asked our server if we got bread with our dinner. His response? ""Oh, well it was still in the oven when you ordered so I thought you wouldn't want any "" Hmmm way to be proactive and ask. nI guess what gets me the most is I gave my feedback about how the steak was awful I didn't even finish my dinner and the response was ""Oh sorry about that "". There was no offer for them to fix it, take it back or own up to it. nI will never visit this place again. I hear the Applebees down the road can cook the hell out of my steak too for a quarter of the price.",1
"I recently celebrated my birthday at La Cave and was very impressed. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. As the name suggests, they have a dim ""hide away "" vibe that projects an understated and intimate elegance. n nOur server was great very attentive and polite. He knew the menu well and was able to make great recommendations. n nThe food at La Cave is easily some of the best in town. My party of three shared four dishes tapas style and they were all excellent. We had a field greens salad with champagne vinaigrette, tomato and mozzarella flatbread with capers, roasted salmon with green beans, and a chicken pesto pasta. Throughout the meal, we literally couldn't stop talking about how great everything was. n nFor a nice restaurant on the strip, the prices were quite reasonable. For the four dishes and a glass of wine each, it came out to about 45 person including tip.",2
The first thing we started to notice was just how slow these people were. Even when we explained to the waiter that things seemed like they are taking a long time it didn't get much better. This is nothing more than an over priced seafood joint. I had the scallops which amounted to what looked like 3 half dollar scallops in some sort of sauce that was sour. Three bites later and your meal is gone. Overall the portions were very small and I actually left hungry even after having desert. This place is all flash and no punch. Go elsewhere.,1
It's a MUST GO SHOW! Carrot Top was hilarious and had me laughing so hard I was the one who was RED!

Right now they currently are offering any two shows for 75 between Excalibur and Luxor so we went and saw Carrot Top and Defending the caveman for an entire night of laughs! n nSide note.or warning.LOL.Carrot Top gets almost totally undressed!

"The hotel was very clean and super comfy, We got upgraded instantly, and the staff was amazing with the amount of crap they were getting from 4 young ladies who didn't go through the proper channels to book a room.

"vegan vegan vegan! n nI don't know how you can make something taste so good and not be at least a little bad for you. Well, definitely get the apple burrito. It has a nice apple to donut ratio which makes it border line dessert! haha. There other donuts are good too, like donuts. n nNice service too. Very friendly.",2
"Sooooo super disappointed with my meal. I've watched the Two Hot Tamales on TV for years, when you could only find them on PBS. So I was pretty excited to have a chance to dine at one of their restaurants. n nMy first issue was with the property itself there's no restroom in the restaurant. I only wanted to wash my hands so it was more than inconvenient to trek down a flight of stairs to do so out in the casino . At a minimum, they should have a sanitizer dispenser available. I just hope the staff has some place more convenient for frequent hand washing. Gross. n nThen the service was just so so. I had one single refill during my meal and I had to ask for it! Even then, the waitress took another 'forever' to honor my request. She came up just as I was heading to the bar to get it myself. n nAll of that could have been forgiven had the food been remotely intriguing. But it wasn't. The guacamole had some funky twangy creamy action going on. We trued doctoring it with the tomatillo sauce. My friend's grilled fish tacos were over cooked and served on some stale tortillas. Other flavors leaned towards bland. Our other companion had to salt his carnitas. Turns out, he paid dearly for his selection. He spent much of the night on the throne. My chicken quesadillas were just 'meh'. I've had better Mexican Tex Mex at chains. I don't expect much from those and in comparison easily get better. Really disappointing.",1

"Saturday night prior to the 3 Doors Down concert at GVR we had reservations at Hanks which we normally enjoy. n nWe arrived a bit early to take advantage of their Happy Hour and the bartender made the most delicious pear martini's. The bar lounge area quickly filled up and within a short time it was standing room only. So, if you're looking to enjoy Happy Hour be sure to get there early! n nOnce we were seated our server introduced himself and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu items and explaining what items were not available because of quality issues. They also finally introduced a non seafood appetizer which delighted my husband who doesn't like seafood. I opted for the crab cakes which, although good, it took me a bit to warm up to as they were not traditional crab cakes but more like soft lumps of crab molded into a round cake form but not baked or pan seared like I would have expected or maybe they were just not cooked long enough . For my entree I ordered the Seafood Jackpot which I always order and thoroughly enjoy. This time, though, I was disappointed the oysters were super small, my crab claws were still somewhat frozen and the shrimp and lobster tail tasted like they had been sitting on ice too long. The lump crab was very good but certainly didn't make up for the price paid for the entree. For my husband who likes steak but prefers it well done, he listened to the servers suggestion and got a bone in steak instead of the filet he would have normally ordered and requested to have it butterflied to ensure it was cooked through. He was also disappointed and didn't finish his steak. He mentioned it didn't have much flavor and was a lot more red than he would normally preferred. He said the best part of his dinner was his baked potato. n nAlthough we've enjoyed Hanks in the past we're not really certain that we'll be going back for dinner since it's supposed to be a high end restaurant and this time, other than the pear martini, it was beyond disappointing especially for the price.",1
"Everything was amazing, well, except for that one thing the whole restaurant is designed around. Everything else though amazing. n nSo there's a line that wraps around this place to get in. They don't take reservations but they will allow you to wander all over the Planet Hollywood after you've put your name down so come with some shopping priorities. n nOnce you get in you appreciate the Vegas Pomp of the place. The walls are made of fire, the drink menu is an iPad, everyone who works here is more attractive than us normies and the jeans are Gordon Ramsey BurGR brand. It's a strip place and yet the prices are very reasonable for it's location. Then again, it is the planet hollywood. n nThe liquid refreshment is exemplary margaritas were top shelf, I had beer on tap I've only seen on tap at high end specialty establishments. Great stuff. The fries came with ample dipping sauces ketchup mayo and were spectacular. Unfortunately. n nThe burger, which was the Pork burger, was dry and relatively mediocre. The waitress recommended it as a favorite, and maybe it is, but it had like four dry ass ingredients and did not inspire me. I was taken aback. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.

"Joy for Joyride! I'm obsessed with the food, especially the ""standard "" taco, which is really sort of a misnomer because there is nothing basic about it. It's flavorful and divine! Nothing here is greasy or overdone the food is fresh and light but very, very tasty. I also love the carnitas taco, and the cheese dip appetizer is to die for. It's topped with fresh jalapenos, other peppers, and tomatoes onions. Soooooo yummy. n nThe atmosphere is casual, fun, and very social. I also love that it's a Mexican joint but they play great indie tunes. No mariachi! My only complaint about the layout is the seating in the lounge patio where you wait for your table. There are these little poof seats that put your arse right at the same height as the table and they're uncomfortable. Yes, this is a very picky little thing but I'm trying to keep myself honest and not just give an all glowing review. n nIf you love fresh and light Mexican food, give Joyride a try!",2
"Went there later one of the weekend nights. The ambiance seems good for friends get together or even family eating. I ordered the Chile Releno stuffed with pork since this place seems to specialize in green chile. And let me say it was amazingly good. I am hooked! A friend ordered the pork shank. It was a bit strange since it's more Italian than new mexican the way it was made. But, it's still tender and yummy. I'll definitely have to go back and try some more things on the menu. But I like!",2
"I called to inquire about private tumbling lessons for my teenager who is thinking of trying out for cheerleading but doesn't have tumbling skills. Paul said that before we spent money on privates, I should bring her in to open gym for an evaluation. Because my daughter is a beginner gymnast, and I've seen the experienced tumblers at open gym, I asked if we could do it some other time, as she would be uncomfortable in front of everyone. Paul said that since cheerleaders have to perform in front of crowds, maybe she should re evaluate cheer. n nSeriously? Does a cheerleader go in front of everyone and do a cheer they never learned before? Of course not, they practice in private and perform when they are ready. Do you know anything about my daughter except I said she was shy? n nNot the type of comment I'd want for a potential coach. Not the smartest business move either.",1
"Curry good. Pancake good. Curry pancake great. n nSouth Indian cuisine is becoming more popular these days and with good reason, as it always feels a bit lighter than the usual curry stodgefest. n nI think curry is much improved by the additional tastes and textures of dosas, idlis and other doughy delights, especially in combination with the various dips and sauces that always accompany them. Check out my photo to see how huge the dosa is. Everything is fairly cheap so it's easy to try a number of small things, and if you can't decide what to have for your main, just about everything comes in a mini starter size. n nI would be happy just dipping pieces of the light pancake in all the delicious dips and sauces, but when you also have some tasty curry inside, it's the gift that keeps on giving. If you're bored of the usual curry standards then this place is for you.",2
Jason price. Was the most discussing individual I have ever met. Won over 5k and was asked to leave. Super winner great hire. Hid his name tag wouldn't tell us his name.

"Often unreachable for follow up or follow through. Commits to deadlines he himself imposes and fails to meet them. Hired to install a new commercial ice machine and his guys took the old ice machine offline then took 12 days to install machine. The subcontractors he hired were unskilled and uneducated workers who needed to call someone else in to solve the issues. The machine has instructions yet they failed to charge the machine with refrigerant prior to plugging it up. n nI had to run to Sams club for ice everyday until the new machine was up and running. I called daily for updates. On those days Young answered I received ""great news will be done tomorrow "" or ""coming back tonight to finish "". n nI should have realized after the first missed deadline the guy was blowing smoke, but he has a trusting personality. Guess he is a wolf in sheep's skin. I don't enjoy speaking ill of people or how they do their business, I normally resolve to just not use their services nor recommend them to friends.

"Round table pizza is usually the bomb. In this case it is made by people who dont speak English and know nothing about making pizza. Too much sauce, too much cheese, undercooked etc etc. If I were the owner of this franchise I'd get my act together cause this place blows.",1

"we showed up with a groupon and it didn't feel like we were cheap, Alex the waiter even helped accomodate the drink specifications. Don't take the west elevators from the convention room side its long and museum quiet, like a complete different world from the north casino side. We had the crab salad, basicaly a thin layer of good crab meat with arugula and thinly sliced hot peppers on top. Then the chicken and the lamb. The chicken was decent and the lamb was fucking amazing. Perfectly cooked but it was the sauce that was trancendent, Alex explained how it was some sort of red wine sauce that gets peppercorn ""infused "" later. The view is of Planet Hollywood and Paris great at dusk",2
Horrible Customer Service! 1st time I ever ordered a pizza they con me into getting a bigger size for a 'better' price. I get it and they screwed up the pizza. I called them and they said they'd have a free one for me next time I order. They lied. No pizza for me they said the next time. I will NEVER waste my money there again. Pizza was mediocre at best.,1

"I tried the pad thai here since that's what I always get to gauge a Thai restaurant. The dish was slightly bland, a bit too sweet and not much else. I did not taste any lime or cilantro, or really anything that reminded me of Pad Thai. The price is the same as any other Thai restaurant, but I think I'd prefer any other Thai restaurant.",1
Maybe a good show to take your children to. As an adult I thought it was boring with the animals only on stage for about a quarter of the show. The rest of the show was very amateurish that you could go see at your local high school. Way overpriced for what you get. This is not what you expect for a Vegas show.,1
"I was let down when I arrived for dinner here. My fish patties were over cooked. When my dinner finally arrived the black beans were cold and the rice was hard and cold, and the chicken that came with my meal was not that great either. When I got home I had to use the bathroom immediately.",1

"Located in the California casino, the cafe seems to be a favorite for the guests of Hawaii. It's cheap and the food quality is average at best.

The only thing that seems edible is the Loco Moco, but a better version of it can be had at Egg I.",1
White peach margaritas.need I say more? Some friends and I enjoyed cocktails and appetizers at the bar prior to our group dinner at Empress Court. Wish we could have just stayed and eaten dinner at Mesa Grill instead! Super friendly bartenders too!,2
Way too loud if you want to hear the person next to you. The steaks are good but sides are just average. The fried chicken was tasteless but juicy. The salmon was dry. Not a good place for a date.,1
"I'm just writing this review to say what everyone else is saying Shinbay is EXCELLENT. n nThe service is top notch, quick, unobtrusive and suits the atmosphere of this restaurant. Our fabulous waitress didn't make a misstep. I was here for my birthday and they just found out when we walked in, at the end of dinner the whole staff had signed a birthday card for me! What a thoughtful touch. n nThe food is incredible. The courses are fresh and original, definitely unique and cutting edge. This is statement food. Every taste was defined and fresh. There wasn't a sloppy dish to be had. It was beautifully presented and some of the freshest I've ever had. n nAnd I have NO idea what people are talking about when they say 'strip mall.' Have you even been to some of the stores or restaurants around there? Definitely high end. I get my hair done in this 'strip mall' and it's by far one of the best salons around. I was seriously looking for a strip mall and instead walked into a beautifully lit corridor that opened up to several beautiful restaurants that led straight here. We walked in and the ambiance and the decor was incredibly high end. Must be that affected Scottsdale attitude coming out live in NYC DC Beverly Hills and then stick your nose in the air, please . n nThis place is beautiful, the food is like nothing I've tasted here yet and I can't wait to go back. I am addicted!",2
"I wanted to like this place, my friends love it, but was SUPER dissapointed. First the one plus the Risotta of the day was AMAZING tonight mushroom cheese. Should have just stuck with that. Now the reason for the ONE star! n Maybe it's better when not busy, cause service was very sub par everytime I needed my water refilled, I had to ask. Not one time did waiter fill it without me begging for more. We had to ask to order 2x before he finally had time to take our order! n The garlic parmesean fries had no garlic they were cold strings with some cheese sprinkled on it. Sent them back with manager and were told they would be off check. Ordered the bowl with 3 turkey balls. My friends chicken balls were better, but turkey were not terrible. Asked for 2 sauces on side, Parmesean like alfredo and the mushroom gravy. The Gravy would have been delish if it was not cold. The bread dipped in the parmesean sauce was really really good. I asked waiter once I flagged him down if gravy was suppose to be hot or cold, he told me hot I told the waiter the gravy was cold and he said he would get me new one. I had 2 balls left.NEVER got gravy. We asked for check before done eating cause had to make it to movie theatre and took so long to order and I told him don't worry about the gravy, just take the balls away. He said he would take them off check, and then didnt even apoligize for no sauce and me barely eating?!?!?!?!?!? When the check came both the FF and the turkey balls I never ate were still on check and we had to ask for them to be taken off. n I really really wanted to like this place, but SOOOO dissapointed! I hope they get it together, I will not be back, and I really hoped to enjoy the place as much as my friends did. I even sent an email to them via facebook and no one bothered to respond. I left hungry and frustrated and dissatisfied! I ended up spending about 20 bucks on candy at Sugar so my stomach wouldnt growl in theatre!",1

"Happy Hour and a sunset? Yes! n nOur party consisted of my wife, myself, and our preschool aged son. We had just finished a long day of touristing yes, obviously from my location, we are visitors and needed dinner. We were originally planning on another location down the street, but that other venue's parking lot was full. n nWe had seen Papi Chulo's on the way in, and decided to head there after our original plans were denied. And it's a good thing too. The chips were fresh and warm, and the two salsa choices were fresh and neither too sedate nor too spicy, either for ourselves or our son. n nI ordered the chimichanga arrachera, which was quite flavorful and, despite being large, not an ""unbeatable "" foe. My wife's selection was the fajitas arrachera, which she simply described as ""delicious "". The flank steak was a hair tough on both accounts, but could have been far worse from our experience. n nOf course, it was happy hour. House margaritas are discounted, and were quite. shall we say. effective. Without being overly ""tequila ey "", shall we say. All this as we enjoyed a sunset dropping down over the valley, as the outdoor seating faces west. n nOn our next trip to the Valley of the Sun, we will be quite likely to pay this restaurant a visit.",2
This place is the best and has the hottest food. It's well worth the price and the portions are fantastic. You will not be disappointed. We recently had the Sangria Margarita and it was delicious.,2
Love this place ! Been going here for over 10 years and average about twice a month for take away. I'm pretty basic but love the Chicken Fried Rice all white meat best in valley and Wor Wonton Soup as well as the Mongolian Beef. Just a great neighborhood restaurant with excellent service and food,2
"Oh how I wish Yelp would allow zero stars. Ok where to begin.this is going to be long. If you are lazy, find summation in last paragraph. n nA while back I needed a reasonable amount of work done. The office clerk, told me the charges which at the time seemed a bit high but I paid. Finally I decided to check with my insurance company, and found out that they were billing me more than they needed to. Armed with this knowledge at my next visit the work was half done so I had no choice but to return before I could mention the error they told me ""the doc is having a special you can get your fillings for half off "" something to this effect . Oh a holiday special, SURE. I knew that this was the amazing credit that was sitting on my account that they wanted to use up instead of refunding me my money. NO thanks, refund please. Issue 1 n nHaving no luck looking for a dentist from my friends family coworkers, I didn't want to neglect my teeth completely waiting for a reasonable alternative. I went back to finish out the major work that needed to be done my fault which took about 2 more visits.or so one would think. I needed a crown. However, the company the office dealt with, got my crown incorrect, not one, but TWO times. Ok 2 times, no big deal eh? Well, for each time they got it wrong, I had to go in and get the tooth template I'm sure it isn't called that done AND then go in again so they could tell me it didn't fit. And I'm a busy person so 4 unnecessary visits are not my cup of tea. Issue 2 n nFinally, we had a winner. After my final visit, I was pretty fed up. I was definitely in the ""glue this sucker on and let me go so I never have to see you people again "".mode. I can't remember but I think I mentioned never coming back my fault again . n nA couple of months later, out of the blue, I received a bill from them. Weird. I looked and noticed that it was for a no show. Scooby says ERR? No show for what? I WENT to my LAST appointment. What is this charge for? I thought, okay, they haven't really been the best with accounts in the past, I'm sure they'll realize they charged the wrong person eventually. My fault AGAIN for not calling them IMMEDIATELY. June comes and I get a notice from a collection company. WTF!?! I called the office and Lucille says ""oh this is for a no show "". Ok, sure, it says that on the bill. What I am telling you is that I NEVER planned on returning, so I KNOW, I wouldn't have made an additional appointment. Her response was ""I will have to talk to the doctor "". After NOT receiving a call back.not a complete shocker there. I call AGAIN. She says ""I talked to the doctor and he remembers being in the room when you made the appointment "". Suuuuuurrrreeee he does. Remind me again when that appointment ""I made "" was.she says ""February 3rd "". Uh huh. it is now July. I call bullshit. Issue 3 n nWhy o why did I go back? Laziness, optimism, naivet u00e9, belief that everyone should have a second chance, or maybe just the belief that they really couldn't be this terrible.could they? I know that I should have walked away after issue 1, so shame on me. But shame on them too! Who needs the added stress of dealing with an office that is inefficient, unapologetic, AND trying to royally screw you at every turn. The bottom line is this office has some shady practices. Find somewhere else to go. I did and I am SO much happier. n nDr Nielsen, enjoy my 50. Apparently, you needed it very badly.",1

"Yep, visited only a couple of days later for lunch with co workers. We all had to be there before it opened at 11 30 or else we'd never have enough to eat. There was a line before it opened and there were always at least a few people who had to wait either at the entrance way or outside at all times. Also important, your whole party has to be there or you won't be seated. n nAnd yes, yet again the tonkotsu impressed. I love it! And this time I ordered the extra chashu. That meat in that delicious broth is just perfect. Maybe one day I'll be compelled enough to order at refill for less than two bucks, but trust me when I say that one bowl is perfect and hits me in the right spot. This might become a regular stop for lunch, of course provided I get there early enough.",2
"I've lived in the area 3 years and had never heard of it! But I'm glad my friend took me here, what a great night! The atmosphere was perfect. Super cozy feeling outside. Felt upscale without being snobbish at all. Great wine list. Definitely manageable without being over the top. We went with the intention to eat real food but our server talked us into sharing some small plates. We tried all four of their dips with pita not nearly enough pita, but out server offered more before we had to ask , the pork belly tacos, and the zucchini chips. I didn't care for the zucchini chips. But that's really the only issue. That, and the pita. But again, good service cancels that one out. Pork belly tacos are kind of overdone and trendy right now, but these one we're really excellent. I can't wait to go back",2

"So disappointing. Ordered the burger salad,the salad was good, the burger was raw and cold. My husband ordered his burger medium rare and it came out well. The fries were greasy and Luke warm.

Too many other great burger places in town.",1
"Bubble tea here is pretty decent. However, it was the waitresses that justify this rating. Although it was amusing for me to watch, they usually ended up confusing up the orders and us when we asked for suggestions. Also the Chinese cuisine was pretty eh. I've had better Chinese fare and noodles at other places. They do have a Cuban menu if people are interested in that, although I can't really comment on how good the fare from that menu is.",1
"Nothing positive to say about this place. Absolutely awful. We ordered three plates at lunch. Shredded beef tacos no beef, no taste of what beef there was, no salsa and no guacamole. Worse yet, taco shells were factory shells and cold to the touch. Carnitas plate ok, roast pork fatty, with minimal spice and taste. One tortilla came with such an expensive plate, request another? pay for another tortilla. By the way, order a soda, your refill will be charged too. Garlic shrimp plate for third meal, shrimp without flavor and presented with dry unflavored rice, and beans on both plates appeared old. Surroundings? took 35 minutes to get to this hole in the wall restaurant in the middle of no where. interior dark, seats old, lumpy and seat backs loose and tight to table. Not sure if table top was cleaned lately, as interior too dark to tell really. Service? not really, no joy here. 65.00 meal for three persons at lunch? with one bottled beer and a house margarita, unbelievably bad. Don't have the heart to tell my friend who recommended this dive about our experience. Can you imagine, any real Mexican restaurant would not have a Carne Asada plate on the menu? Unbelievable. Truly, two tacos at Jack in the Box for .99 have more meat and taste then what we experienced today. Stomach upset on the way home, had to pull over . . . .",1

"Went here for afternoon tea and this place was pretty much empty on the inside. I decided to sit outside. Beware! The tables are very dusty! Server was attentive and polite. Can't remember the first tea I had, but it tasted like watered down perfume. I switched to a different one and it wasn't any better. However, the scones with the cream and jam here are addicting! Seriously, they were so good I had to order another round! The sandwhiches here are below average. Hard and slightly stale bread with either cucumber or chopped smoked salmon. Desserts were okay, nothing spectacular. The only reason I would come back is because of the scones.",1
"Richardson's may be one of New Mexico's best kept secrets so well kept it's improbably located in a Phoenix, AZ strip mall. The place feels so authentic it's like you're dining in an Anasazi cliff pueblo on a desert night. YEAH it's like that. Get some of that extra spicy green chile if you want to have a good cry. The place is small and often packed and its clientele is understandably enthusiastic , but if southwest cuisine is your bag, it's well worth the trip and any wait for a table.",2
"I know this place is very popular with people in the west island but every time I go to this restaurant for some kind of special occasion, scheduled by people from the neighbourhood.

I fear this restaurant is a waste of time the only good thing about it is the parking. Do your selves a favour and stay away.",1
"I had absolutely no idea this bar and restaurant existed, such is its inconspicuous location on the Royal Mile, so when I met some friends for dinner here, I was quite delighted by the fairy light draped pathway which leads inside. I'm a sucker for fairy light enchantment, so this put me in a good mood for evaluating the rest of the experience. n nThe interior is very polished art deco style, modern but warm, with purple booths and comfy armchairs. Definitely good for a sly date or two, as it just has that ambience to it. The menu offers fairly classic fare but with a modern spin to it. The scallops and ginger marmalade I had to start were very, very good, as was the loin of pork I had for a main. The bottle of prosecco we ordered had a lovely flavour to it and came with strawberries to taste, which is always a nice touch. Having a meal here could prove to be quite expensive, but you can check out the menu on the website beforehand, and anyway, Monteiths is a pretty different dining experience from most establishments in Edinburgh, so I wouldn't expect prices to be rock bottom. n nComing here just for drinks is also a good call, as being slightly hidden away, you can escape the masses of revellers going to other bars in the area. The bar still gets busy at weekends though. The cocktail list has some unique concoctions on it, so if you do come in, make sure you sample one.",2

"Let's just say I would never recommend this place. It takes a lot for me to get up and walk out of a place after ordering, but everything that could be wrong with a restaurant experience is exactly what we experienced at this place. And we never did get to the food. After 40 minutes with only beverage service, it was not worth torturing ourselves to wait.

Yeah um this place rocks. Cool bar area. The bomb,2
"We have purchased quite a bit of musical equipment and instruments from this location, and they always do a good job.

They have a decent selection of keyboards, low end to high end, and didn't sneer when I bought a less expensive model. n nGuys in the guitar department are great, and helped the Mr with a new bass guitar purchase. I prefer Sam Ash to the large competitor, and recommend it to friends looking to make a music related purchase. n nOh, they also offer a music teacher discount, which I've used and has come in super handy, especially with expensive instruments.",2

"When is this stupid ""Fresh Mex "" craze going to end? How many more dime a dozen Americanized read bland Mexican places do we really need? Over a decade ago it was Baja Fresh. That was cool, nice fresh change from Filiberto's, and all the other wonderful greasy Mexican places. Then a few years ago we got Chipotle. And it was fun for awhile, but eventually you get sick of eating the same rice saturated burrito over and over and over again. Now we also have Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and a few other places. n nI wish I could avoid eating at all these places for the rest of my life, but alas, sometimes I find myself there, choking down this tedious slop, because all my friends like this kind of food, and I like to be sociable on rare occasions . Or, as in the situation that brought me to Cafe Rio, it's where the family is having dinner. n nAnyways, I had their ""special "" pork barbecoa or whatever they call it , and it was pedestrian, at best. It did not taste natural sorry, guys, but pork is not supposed to be sweet. It's supposed to be nice and smoky. It's supposed to taste like meat. n nThis place is the epitome of the worst aspects of disposable American culture. No heart, no soul, and large portions. It doesn't matter what it tastes like, as long as it fills your stomach, right? Cafe Rio is possibly the worst offender I think I would rather eat at Qdoba or Costa Vida.",1

"I went for an oil change on my lunch break at this location. There was only one car ahead of me so I figured it would not take long to get the job done. We decided to go to lunch at the Sonic next door while we waited for the oil change to be completed. 20 minutes after my car had been pulled in the garage and the hood lifted, I got a call saying they needed me to come over. It took no more than 5 minutes to finish our food and walk over. When I got there, they explained to me that my plates did not match the vehicle on file and they were not able to work on my car. I explained that the car on file was a car I had 2 years ago, the name on the account belonged to my father and I had brought my new car to this location in the past. Since I only had 15 minutes to make it back to work, I told them I would have to come back. this is where it all went down hill. n nHe explained to me that I could not leave because they had drained the oil. ""According to the law, they cannot work on the car until they confirmed that the license plates truly belonged to the car, "" the assistant manager told me. So, I do not understand how draining the oil is not working on the car. I explained to the manager that it makes no sense to even touch the car without obtaining all necessary information. He was EXTREMELY argumentative and told me to stop talking and listen to him. I listened to the hypocritical statements and still believed that draining the oil from a car is WORKING on the car. Then the manager informed me that in the time we had spent talking, he could have had it done already. He never said sorry for the inconvenience and instead kept telling me that it was my fault for not staying inside the customer waiting room. Also, they never even asked for my registration or license. n nNeedless to say, I was trapped and I had to have them complete the oil change. I did not even want them touching my car after this. I was completely offended by the action of the assistant manager and wanted to get back to work on time. I waited 5 minutes and they filled my car with oil. The young man who rang me up apologized and gave me a 10 discount He should be the assistant manager . I think it should have been free because I did not want any service to continue and it was not my fault they had worked on my car without confirming information with me.",1
My favorite sushi place,2
I hosted an event last week at Tommy V's. It exceeded all my expectations. The owner and staff went above and beyond to accommodate my very large group of guests. The food was amazing! It was a perfect night in every way.Tommy V's is officially my favorite Scottsdale restaurant.,2
"My children give this 5 stars. Love the drink machine, chips and if you use the loyalty card they'll discount your meals by quite a bit!",2
"I went here twice over the weekend, once in Scottsdale and once here in Chandler on ray. I must say I think the service is indeed better at the one on Ray, food taste more as it should here too. I had their vegas roll, totally delicious! I love the happy hour here more than anything! Ill be returning again and again. nI'm glad I finally found a sushi place that almost can hold it's own against the ones I frequented in CA.",2
"Nothing bad to say about this place. I came in this morning and even though there were a couple people ahead of me and the guy was running everything by himself, I was still in and out within a reasonable amount of time. Very fast and efficient and honored the discount for mentioning yelp. n nI will definitely be coming here from now on instead of Jiffy Lube.",2
"I think this place is more of a 3.5 star kinda place, but I thought it was closer to 4 than 3. I had been wanting to try this place since it opened. I am in this area often, so I decided to give it a try last week. nI remember coming to the restaurant that was previously in this location, and the set up is similar. I love how open it is and the style of the restaurant. The cashiers and other people working there were all nice, came by and checked on us a few times which was a plus. nI like how fast this place was and that there were healthier, fresh tasting options available. I ordered the veggie wrap, thought it was a tad overpriced, but it is in Scottsdale Quarter, so that is to be expected. The wrap was tasty, the vegetables were fresh and tasty. I was also excited that it was in a spinach tortilla, my favorite. My only complaint was that all of the cheese was stuck in like two separate large clumps on each half. I still enjoyed it quite a bit, ate the whole thing and was satisfied. nI would like to come back to try the beet salad sometime, or maybe the caprese sandwich. This is a good place to stop for a quick, fresh meal.",2
"Nothing out of this world spectacular, but they have lots of good specials, they deliver and their prices are really reasonable. n nAfter perusing a downtown hotels room service menu which was astronomically expensive and weak we decided to surf the net for some decent pizza, and found Genoa's. For 10 we got a good sized medium pizza delivered to our hotel within 30 minutes. n nSaved our night! n nI would give five stars, but the delivery driver wouldn't come up to our room for some reason. He made me meet him in the lobby. Stupid. Other than that though, it was just what I wanted.",2
"Are you looking to take every delicious teaspoonful ahem, alright, HEAPING tablespoons of Nutella to the next irresistible level? Or what about that favorite meal you love to make that needs a little ""umph "" this spring to keep it in its place? n nI've found the secret, and it's so delicious, I can't possibly keep it to myself. I've visited Olive and Marlowe for the past 2 weeks in a row, and I have no intention of stopping. Was it the charming little girl who greeted me at the door exclaiming ""Wow! You're tall! "" I'm all of 5'5 on a good day ? Was it the smorgasbord of taste testing options for the infused olive oils and vinegars they feature? Or was it the incredible comforting scent of freshly baked goodies from La Gourmandine on Saturday? Whatever keeps drawing me there, will likely be a treat for you, too. n nI bought a lovely Basil Olive Oil that is my new favorite ingredient to top off the perfect Caprese Salad. n nI bought a croissant that challenges just about any croissant I've had in all of my world travels. A few minutes in the oven turned this croissant into a fluffy, flaky and buttery perfection that only could be improved with a ahem ""dollop "" of Nutella. This alone, should make you run to check this place out. n nLastly, the owner has wonderful suggestions and ideas for your next culinary adventure. I appreciate her recommendations and value her input. Her suggestion of making a grilled cheese using one of the oils and the ciabatta bread that I bought was a delicious, quick dinner on a busy night for me this week. Community collaborative cooking? I like it! n nHaving moved here from out of state, I've often been told that the best food in Pittsburgh is made right in your own kitchen. After making a stop at Olive and Marlowe part of my new weekly routine, I fully understand why this saying is true. n nHope to see you there when I stop by this weekend, but please be kind and save a croissant, and a compliment for me!",2
"Second time at Crescent for a concert, it was equally a mess to get in.so hot and stuffy inside the ballroom. We left early although the sound system is great and the artist we saw was awesome.it was too hot to stay longer.",1
"I think T.G.I. Friday's is a fine establishment, especially for chain restaurants. But this spot is terrible. I've been here twice and have been thoroughly disappointed. The first time my problem was with the service. It took forever to be seated and to be served. The second time it was with the food. My wings were undercooked and my well done cheeseburger was pink. Then my date's well done burger was pink also, by that point she didn't even want to send it back because we already sent two things back. And on top of that the waitress took forever to return with the bill. I know some casino restaurants are crappy because they don't rely on repeat business and make it up with volume. But this one is pathetic. I will not be back to this one.",1
"I have eaten here twice and I had a similar experience both times. The service was very good! The atmosphere was OK. The food was average. I have been to all of the top tier steak houses in Vegas and this would definitely not be in the top five. Ramsey is a marketing genius and I am sure this restaurant will be a huge success due to his name recognition. But if you want quality for the price check out STK, Nine, Cut or about a dozen others.",1
"Being in all elements of the industry for quite awhile it's been years since I've written a zero as a tip. I also concede being a bar owner myself I feel uncomfortable with writing a negative revue on yelp but. n nI've been here about 4 5 times in the past year and I've always had amazing service sitting at the bar. As of tonight, 6 01 12, the service was absurdly bad. I don't blame the personality of the bartender, he seemed friendly enough, yet he was just not meant to be behind the bar. You can't take someone who just got their ABC bartending certificate and plop them behind the bar on a Friday night and expect good service. n nHopefully they will get their shit together because the chef is pretty good and HRH is short on good, informal restaurants.",1
"Pizza is okay. I little too much garlic I bit into a whole clove under the cheese . It taste better than little cesar's or domino's, but as far as fresh, baked bistro pizza goes.I've tasted better. n nIt's next door to a smoke shop. I think there's a double door adjoining the them. It smells like hookah when you first walk in. The place looks like a poorly remodeled cafe lounge. Seems like it might be a neat place to hang out has a pool table and large tv , but there are quite a few guys friends of the owner? hanging around who make it a little awkward. n nThe cashier cook was nice, but I question the cleanliness of the kitchen.",1
I'm pretty sure this bitch closed down. They haven't been open anytime I've ridden by in over a week. nCan't say I'm terribly disappointed. Bring on something new!,1
"Iconic Frank Lloyd Wright architecture and high quality event programming combine to make ASU's Gammage Auditorium a cultural gem and a highlight for the arts in Arizona. Besides being a stop for the 2004 U.S. Presidential Debates, it's probably most well known for its role as the primary stop in Phoenix for Broadway plays and musicals. n nI last attended Les Miserables, one of a number of ""Broadway Across America "" shows that stops in town. Even though we sat up in the second level, the sight lines were not that bad, seats were ok and the circular interior and winding staircases were fun to wander around. n nThis building was originally commissioned in the 1950s to be an opera house in Baghdad, but for whatever reason ASU lucked out and scored this design for Gammage. It's now one of the most recognizable buildings on campus.",2
"Best pho in Vegas but the service is slow and horrible. If you're that busy, hire more damn employees.",1
"Today I went back and got a Moreo. Still pretty tasty. n nBut one of the sandwich cookies was half missing. What kind of counter help gives you something that isn't all there? I didn't notice 'til I was driving away, as it was ensconced in a bag, and I'm not going to drive back for half a cookie, but this bugs me. Either it was put in the cookie jar this way unacceptable attention to detail or it broke when the counter help retrieved it similarly unacceptable. n nI won't be back.",1
"If there was a chain of this place so many people would be vegan On our short trip to Vegas we came here twice. Got the Italian sampler and the Mexican sampler. Everything was scrumptious! Even my taco bell loving husband couldn't deny how fresh and flavorful everything was. We got to try 4 or 5 things in Each of the sampler platters. The desserts were bomb too! Before we got back on the plane we took food and a bunch of the crackers, tortillas and chips with us. I don't like the gluttony of buffets on the strip but I'll look forward to coming back here next time I'm in town! Or better yet, make this chain PLEASE!",2
"I was visiting my parents in Scottsdale over the weekend and my father made reservations at the Local Bistro for dinner. Both my parents are older and my Mom, in particular, has difficulty hearing in crowded rooms so when my father called to make the reservation he specifically asked that we would like to be seated outside since the restaurant is loud and it is difficult to hear one another in the crowded, noisy dining room. He talked to the manager when he made the reservation and was assured that everything would be fine. When we got to the restaurant, we were informed by the hostess that they did not take reservations for the patio. She quickly called the ""manager "". The restaurant was crowded and horrifically noisy. The manager came over, mentioned that he did remember talking to my father but denied ever having said the we could sit on the patio. We were informed that the patio is first come first serve. Instead of apologizing or trying to figure out a way to seat us on the patio the manager very rudely said that the conversation never happened and basically we were out of luck, We left. I happen to be in the restaurant business and I was pretty shocked at the abrupt, brusque and rude way my parents were treated. Needless to say, we will never go there again. I should not have to remind you that when people are so shabbily treated they tend to tell all of their friends, their children and their families. nI can only say to you that you should enjoy the crowds right now, but every dog has their day. I have every confidence that the rude behavior, snotty attitude and failure to try to observe the most basic rules of customer service will catch up to your establishment. It is not like you are the only restaurant in Scottsdale, or even in your shopping center for that matter.",1
"In one word, horrible! We stayed here thinking we were getting a nice place on the strip, boy were we wrong! The place was so run down and falling apart. The rooms were dirty and cheaply made. The shower rod fell off, there was no remote for the tv so the tv was no use, and the rug was stained and filthy it made our feet black. Outside the rooms the carpet was held together with duct tape, the wallpaper was peeling off, there were pipes and wiring hanging from the ceiling, and there was no access to stairs, which is a huge fire hazard! The elevators were not all working so we had to wait in line to get to and from our room. Sometimes it took us 10 or so minutes just to go two floors. Plus, the pool was under reconstruction so we had no access to their pool. When it was time to check out, the lady informed us that we had charges on our card. We told her we should not have because we had their promotion of 15 a day for food and drinks. We never went over the 15 a day. She then told us that tips don't count towards the 15. This was never explained to us! She should have kindly removed those charges and apologized for the inconvenience, but instead she gave us attitude and made it seem like our fault. It was a very SNEAKY way for the hotel to make more money! We will NEVER again stay at this hotel, it was the worst Vegas hotel experience we have ever had! Save your money and DO NOT stay here!",1
"Can't complain. While 11 for a roast beef sandwich and a cup of soup seemed a bit steep, I learned on this trip to Montreal that there isn't much cheaper to be found in the city, and at least the quality of the ingredients seemed on par with the price. In any case, there are many cafes around that have both good free wifi and solid food, so St. V is commendable on that front.",2
"Cheap, . and nicely done overall! nNothing fancy but for a delivery in HoMa its as good as it gets. nRavioli Hunan are always my favourite here. nSeems like an insignificant detail but its so fun to be understood quickly over the phone. They speak good french and english and japanese I presume! nAnd that's an extra star for me.",2
I'm from LA and know good Mexican food. This place taste just like the Mexican food in Southern California. Amazing. Best I have had in Vegas so far.,2
Unfortunately I'm not a stranger to dental work and I've had an unfair number of procedures over the years. n nTo say that Dr. Castano was fabulous is somewhat of an understatement. Root canals are never a fun experience however mine was the most boring one I've ever encountered. n nKudos to the entire team Surprise Endodontics. I highly recommend this office.,2
"We came tonight to use a coupon we bought, and I should have read the most current review before I bought the coupon. Just like the other reviewer, we arrived and waited at the hostess stand. and waited. and waited. I poked my head around to the bar side and the dining room side and saw people working and eating , but no one ever came to the hostess stand. A waiter even walked by us twice on his way out to the patio and back in, and he never even acknowledged us. n nAfter 10 minutes of waiting, we cancelled our reservation on OpenTable and went to Vine, where we had a fantastic experience. Now I'm stuck with a coupon I don't even want to use because I have no interest in going back.",1
STAY away from the Dungeness crab. They claim its fresh but they are actually recooking cooked crabs. The meat was mushy upon opening so we complained and received another new crab. It was however the same mushy and spoiled crab. Other than that everything else was fine.,1
"I have heard a few things about this place from my coworker, she absolutely loves the Benedict. My coworkers and I always pass by but never really end up eating here, mistake! It wasn't until I was at the Phoenix airport and I ran into a New Yorker and we randomly started chatting about food in Arizona .and she claimed they have pizza that is comparable to NY. Well well. I thought must try this next week! You walk into a really clean and open ambiance, I love the natural lighting. The staff was very friendly, however I wish they would recommend us dishes more, everyone we asked kind of said everything is just good. Lots of options from sandwiches to pizzas to breakfast foods. Now on to the food! n nEndive Salad my coworker got this, she is vegetarian and she loved the apple combination with the blue cheese, they gave her two different kinds of salad dressings one was something like a honey mustard and the other was this spicy mustard and horse radish. The spicy mustard one went well with everything! We dipped our pizza in it, our french dip, and the french fries. Overall a very fresh salad, the blue cheese taste is really strong so a caution if you are not into that. n nFrench dip I really enjoyed the dip, sometimes french dip sauce is overly salty but this was a clear beef broth that was simmered to perfection. I liked the overall sandwich but I'm a fan of medium rare beef. This french dip was well done, it wasn't dry though so that was good, I wish they could somehow have their beef with a medium rare option. Comes with french fries and a salad. n nPizza The name of the pizza totally slipped my mind. It's the 3rd one up from the bottom of the menu, the one with the egg in the middle sorry! . We got extra basil on top for some extra freshness. I am a big fan of brick oven pizza and this one takes the prize. The crust is perfectly flaky and the sauce is not too sour like most places. I don't want to hype this up so just go try it and see for yourself. Hopefully you come out as happy as I was. n nOverall, I feel like when I'm done eating pizza and sandwiches at other places it feels heavy and I have a super lethargic afternoon. Cafepino does not have that heavy feeling and that usually correlates with fresh ingredients! I am looking forward to trying more things on the menu, see you again soon.",2
"We had a HORRIBLE experience at Hometown Classic American Eats! There was only one server. He was overwhelmed. he told us several times he would be with us before he actually came and took our order, then the drinks took FOREVER to arrive. I heard him apologizing to everyone in the restaurant over and over. Our food took FOREVER he repeatedly told us ""they are plating it now "" or ""we ran out of biscuits we r making them fresh "". This created an expectation of fresh hot food. When the food finally came the biscuits were nowhere near fresh and the gravy was ice cold. Regardless of the claims that they were making fresh biscuits, I expect my food to arrive hot especially when I've waited way longer than it should take. When I told the server it was cold he offered to take it back but at that point I just wanted to eat , The server than pointed out the owner to me, and THAT'S WHEN I GOT PISSED. The owner who I thought was a customer was sitting at a table drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Really? If I can hear the server apologizing to everyone, I'm sure the owner did too. He should have got up off his ass and been helping with drinks, orders, refills, etc. At the very least he should came over to our table and pretended to give a shit about our bad experience so we will come back. Then I noticed our server had his jacket on and was then gone without telling us. So we then sat there FOREVER AGAIN waiting for our check. We should've walked out. Right at about this point a party of 10 or more came in and the owner jumped up to help them. I guess a party of 10 means more to him than a full restaurant consisting of a lot of small parties. Waitng for the check I had my head cocked completely around and made eye contact with a staff member and the owner several times, they never came over to see if I needed something. If I have to get up to get my check why am I tipping u? Also our table could've been turned a couple more times if we didn't spend so much time WAITING. Every step involved a lot of WAITING. To the owner If u want to drink coffee and read the paper, do that shit at home. If u want a successful restaurant get off your ass and act like your customers matter to u. If you are not happy and willing to the grunt work for your business, you will fail. You could've turned the whole situation around by helping. If u would've helped we would've got out sooner, and left happy and you could turn the table again. Restaurant 101. Also everyone in the restaurant business knows, when there is a problem or several the manager or owner needs to visit the table. Also everyone in the restaurant business knows as a server when u leave, u let your customers know. You introduce then to the new server, you don't just leave. Did u even want a tip? You should take your staff to the Peppermill on the strip on a Sunday morning and sit at the counter and watch these people work. We are never coming back.",1

"My 9 year old is big into ancient Egypt, so she really wanted to stay at the Luxor. Given that it's one of the more affordable hotels on the strip, we stayed there for 3 nights last weekend. It was overall a good experience. n nWe lucked out and got a nice, standard room in the pyramid. The room was clean, the furniture was in good condition and the beds were comfortable. The room was large enough to be comfortable for our family of 4. Beware, though, that the beds seem to be doubles and not queens. n nWe went to the pool which was adequate though not particularly exciting. We ate at the Pyramid cafe, which was OK. The best part of our stay was the ancient Egyptian theme of the hotel, which the kids really enjoyed. I'd say the worst part was the location, too far from the hotels in the central part of the strip. n nFull and I do mean full review at http marga.voxpublica.org 2011 08 luxor las vegas review ",2

No bueno amigos! n nBeing a recent transplant from Chicago and knowing some pretty fantastic Mexican places i.e. La Pasadita, Zacatacos, etc . I was hoping that there would be equally good Mexican food around Mesa. It is clear that Filiberto's cannot compete at all and has little to offer.

"Cappy's is a rarity on Walnut Street it's as close to unpretentious as you'll ever get in this affluent and often snooty shopping district. As others have noted, it's a dive bar that happens to serve pretty decent food my wife thinks that the Big Mountain sandwich is to die for and I'd agree . The service has always been friendly, and it never seems to get as loud in here as it gets in some other places Shady Grove, I'm looking at you . n nI know it might sound strange, but one of the things that I appreciate the most about Cappy's is that it treats its waitresses as waitresses, not as sex symbols. I've always found the skimpy outfits that waitresses choose to wear or are made to wear at some other places to be rather insulting these women are there to do their job, not to be ogled at by everyone in the area. So thumbs up, Cappy's, for treating your female employees with some respect! n nMy wife and I moved away from the Shadyside area a few months ago. Cappy's is the one thing we miss. Big Mountain forever!",2
"Worst place to go! This was my third visit and all three times horrible and thought I would give it another try, so third strike your out! The manager personally made sure the car was done correctly when I returned dissatisfied. I will not be returning. I will be going to the arrowhead location if I go to Danny's at all.",1
"Nello's is just down the street from us, so it has been a family favorite for years. We always enjoy a meal here! Our family hasn't chosen as to which type of pizza we prefer, Chicago, New York, California, etc. We know we like fresh ingredients, crispy crust, lots of cheese and cold drinks. You definitely get all that and great service at Nello's. n nFresh pizza does take a while longer to prepare than chain par baked dough. The salads are huge and are full of flavor. An there's always a favorite on tap. We enjoyed the Four Peaks Peach Ale. n nNello's just added a Bambino's Menu, fantastic now they have some great kid's size meals for the little ones to enjoy too!",2
"Place seems like it would be a hipster trap but the food is flawless. Wine list is amazing if you can afford anything on it. Seafood platter to start and an all natural grass fed beef steak to finish, with organic spinach in the middle. Flatout awesome and not at all what I expected.",2
"I walked in, and the overall feel of the place was run down and dingy. I sat down in the pedicure chair, and as the woman began filling the tub, I noticed what appeared to be an oil slick on top of the water with dirt and shimmer from what I can only assume was from the previous customer's lotion swirling around. I said my tub didn't look clean, at which point, she started rubbing the other tubs with her fingers, saying, ""it's clean! It's clean! You're wrong, it's clean! "" I tried to bring her attention to what was unclean about my specific tub, but she kept interrupting me, saying, ""you're wrong, it's clean! "" I decided not to proceed with the service, said thanks, anyway, and had my pedicure at a salon down the road. This one was both sanitary, and staffed by courteous people, which Tiffany's was not.",1
"I'm not very adventurous when it comes to food, so, I had chicken vegetables IN a pineapple.it ruled so hard.",2

"I can maybe understand giving Pink Taco one star because the tacos I had were actually really good. However I really wish I paid more attention to the verbal reviews I received that warned me against eating here. For, despite enjoying the flavor of the carnitas tacos while I ate them, the price I paid for the next 36 hours of gastro intestinal misery was far from worth the few moments of guacamole deliciousness. n nNormally, I would just attribute my digestion issues to residual side effects from drinking a yards worth of margarita composed of the absolute best of the bottom shelf alcohols, but when everyone else in my party started canceling their plans for their last night in Vegas in exchange for a bed bathroom pepto alka seltzer combination, my powers of deduction left me no other choice than to blame pink taco. n nI don't think I'll eat here again. Las Vegas has too many other amazingly fantastic places to eat. FIN",1
Wow. Lame service. Server took ages to greet us and never apologized. Burger was supposed to be medium and came out very rare after a 45 minute wait. Wait staff needs training. People complaining all around us. Skip this place. Expensive and poor quality.,1
"Took a flyer on this place because we were in the neighborhood. n nThey had a decent wait, but a nice outdoor and heated patio on which to chill out and have a cocktail. We passed the time nicely. n nFood was really good, the service was pretty cool with a very casual vibe thrown in and one of the chefs actually brought out our dinner because my girlfriend wanted to know how they incorporated celery root into their soup. Our server brought out an envelope with the recipe and quietly slipped it to her, which was followed up by a visit from one of the chefs and a discussion about how to cook with celery root properly. n nThis really pushed St. Francis into a major thumbs up when chefs and restaurants aren't afraid to share knowledge and talk with customers about techniques, they win in our book. n nGo there you'll enjoy it.",2
"Mmmm.artichoke and avocado enchiladas are a veggie saur dream come true! Delicious and then some. n nThe atmosphere is nice in here, and it's definitely a busy place because of San Tan being such a hot spot for shopping, but the service is really pretty great. n nThe drinks are somewhat pricey thus only 4 stars instead of 5 , so realistically, this isn't a place you want to come for more than one drink unless you plan to have a large bill at the end of the meal.",2
I honestly was not impressed. I ordered the chilli relleno. The dish seemed pre made reheated. I thought that it was strange when I asked for it with no onions and they said it couldn't be done. Because it was already made. I'm really sad because this was supposed to be my special birthday dinner. ,1
I love HIKARI! n2nd time around and it just gets sweeter all the time!,2
"OMG I am having shakes just thinking about this place! n nSo good! I heard angels sing to me as I bit into my burger. My husband looked at me like I was crazy, but i didn't care. This was my first food ""O "" and dang it I wasn't going to be disturbed. n nI stopped for a moment and took a bite of my waffle fries. Then it happened. I saw the light. When my sight returned all I saw was an empty plate and my hubbies perplexed face. This place is a must if you are in Vegas.",2
"If playing frisbee golf in a canal that's been converted into a park isn't your thing, then feast your eyes on this beast! Hills, or are they mini mountains? You decide when throwing those frisbees to your heart's delight! n nBe forewarned, this is not a course for the beginner. There are many desert shrubbery, trees, and other unforeseen obstacles that await you around every turn. Make sure you bring extra bright frisbees, because you can spend countless minutes, sometimes up to 15 or 20 minutes searching for them! The scenery is great though. Around this time, there are many wildflowers that grow and it's not too hot this time of year in late January and early February. n nThis appears to be a popular spot for frisbee golf enthusiasts because there were two groups not far in front of us and two groups after us during the midday Saturday before noon. With only 2 people, you can get through games fairly quickly, but with 4 people in our group we let some groups play through since only two of us actually had some skill while the other two didn't. I shall return though! This park offers a difference change of pace and scenery!",2
"Hey, the food wasn't bad. Like a lot of people here, definitely felt like we paid a lot for what we got but maybe that's the ""natural "" or ""true "" food mentality . Our server Tyler didn't really pay attention to us lots of awkward eye contact, like oh shit I forgot about you guys , and no offers to refill drinks. The close proximity of tables can make one feel claustrophobic. My girl friend ordered the curry and commented that she felt something was missing afterwards. Come to find the rice was missing. When we informed our waiter, his reply was simply ""sorry about that I will let the kitchen know. "" 14 for an incomplete meal! Not to mention the vegetables were semi raw still but maybe that's a ""true "" thing .",1
"i have been there few times, but this time just amazing, I met Zain Engineer , he is the best service consultant that I have , and my car well done. I'm happy be there with him. Thanks a lot.",2
This place is fun if you have little kids with you but you'll be seriously disappointed if you've come here for the food. And if you don't have any kids w you.just go to Nora's. It costs less and the food is awesome there.,1
It seems that Vinny's close down we been there a few times love it . Wish I knew why they are close even the number is not in service if anyone can give me information on what happen that be great n nstockups aol.com,2
"Used to love this place. Lately it has been dead, the staff seems to have all been fired or moved to obscure shifts. n nThe new staff is terse, douchey, and seems bent on alienating the regulars. The pub quiz they host on Wednesday used to be fun but the new host is deadpan and as interesting as a watching a corpse decay. Also don't host a quiz if you cannot pronounce Quixote correctly. n nThe food was good, but when I go somewhere to unwind, I will someplace else from now on. I wonder if the owner will notice the huge chain of 1 star reviews lately and get a clue.",1
I was a weekly regular for years when this place use to be Lao Thai Kitchen. I tried it when the new owners took over and I must say I was pretty disappointed with the food. I ordered take out of the Tom Kha Gai soup and the chicken was so tuff I literally couldn't chew it. The broth was so so and not as flavorful as I usually expect. I ended up throwing away the rest of my soup since I found it pointless to eat without the chicken. My Pad Thai was so greasy and had absolutely no flavor. Im hoping I just went on an off day because i really did love this place. The one good thing was the staff is really friendly. I see reviews from others that they liked it so I'll give it one more try and see if they improved the food. If so I will change my review.,1
"It's been awhile since I've had a really good hot dog. Thank goodness Detroit Motor City delivered! I hit this joint up this afternoon with my friend for a little pre movie meal. I have never been to Detroit, but eating here made me want to check it out. n nI ended up getting the Detroit style hot dog, minus the spicy cheese. And I also got their absolutely freaking fantastic onion rings. Every single onion ring was perfectly battered and fried. Each and every time I bit into my onion ring it came away perfectly Ie the onion did not pull out or away from itself , that is the sign of a GOOD onion ring. The dog was tasty too, it had a snap and even though I was a bit skeptical, all the ingredients on it made it really good. I was even tempted to ask for extra jalapenos, but I resisted. n nOh, you gotta make sure to get the root beer! When I find myself in Henderson again I know where I'm going.",2
"Bad, bad, so disappointed with Zumanity show, poor, when you mention Cirque du Soleil you expect a lot! This s not my first time in this Cirques, but this one was the worst, I'm from LA and I had guests from Va. That weekend and I offer to take them to see this show! I wanted they see how beautiful is Cirque du Soleil, wrong decision. I wish I have my money back, I spend on 6 tickets.",1
"Food is phenomenal here.that sums up why it is so popular and you always have a wait. I try to come here early during the week before all the Central Phoenix Millennials wake up. Anytime before 9am is good, ha ha. Parking is tough if you dont get a spot behind the building. My favorite is the bacon and eggs.simple but the bacon is more like a steak! The potatoes are just awesome, with all the herbs they are so flavorful that I am craving them now as I right this review. The place is larger now that they moved a block away and very nice and modern inside. Highly recommend visiting here before you die.and not on the weekend.",2
"i used to shop there all the time. not so much anymore. his prices have gone sky high. much higher than inflation in other stores. that can't be good for business. now when i go to food city, which has the best prices on produce, it's crowded with asians. i wonder if they've stopped going to lee lee's too.",1
"We went there on a thursday 'Ladies' night "" wanting italian food. The starters were blend, the pizze greasy beyond imagination, and the martinis full of so many other things you could even taste it. This was a real disappointment. If you want good italian or just good food walk further!",1
"This place was ok, but nothing out of this world. We wanted to try his pastries and have a drink. The line was super long so we sat at the cake boss restaurant to save time since they sell the same pastries in both. We had two pastries and a drink and water and the bill was 41dll I don't mind the price if it's good, but this was just ok, average. if you ask me its terribly over priced maybe my expectations were to high and that's why I seem harsh Lol. Save your self some money and just make the huge line for his bakery and don't waste your time and money at the restaurant. Line is about 20 minutes long. Service was terrible, the waiter took forever to take our order and after he did he took even longer to bring the drinks out, we just paid for the bells and whistles, which soumded more like beeps and toots, Lol",1
"GREAT LATE NIGHT DRUNK FOOD. n nIf you're looking for the right price point about 10 , a place to eat at in the wee hours of the morning because you've been partying all night at the Palms def hit this place up. It's the only thing open around at 5 6am. It's better than Denny's and it's convenient. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and found that to work out for my hangover the next morning as well. lol.",2
"If you like hunting and sifting then this place is for you! It is jam packed with all kinds of stuff! n nThere is room upon room, there is even a crazy room full of every kind of old window imaginable! n nBeware there is no A C, at least it felt like that this past Tuesday when the high was 109, but they do have a ton of fans on all over the place. Also I wouldn't wear white, its a bit dusty. n nthe one thing I found didn't have a price tag on it and neither of the employees could tell me how much it was, one said 45 the other said 60 , they said if I waited they'd call the owner, but I was on a tight schedule. Oh well, I might go back and see if its priced. n nMy aunt found a few things in there she couldn't live with out. n nCool place to spend a day searching for old relics.",2
"My fiance and I are Las Vegas locals, and often frequent the restaurants in the Henderson Green Valley area. As folks who work in the service and hospitality industries ourselves, we are often on the look out for restaurants that offer both good service and great food! King's Fish House is one of the better seafood restaurants in Las Vegas, and has a good reputation. We have been to this place before, and almost always have a great time. The menu is huge, with many items to choose from not just seafood in fact, on my most recent visit here, I ordered a Southwestern Salad with blackened chicken. Our server was a great guy with a lot of information on the menu items. He offered some suggestions to help us decide which items we would choose for lunch, and he was courteous and personable. A win win! n nKing's Fish House has definitely taken a more hand's on approach to making sure that the service is great and that the food comes out fresh and in a timely manner. Always a bonus when you visit a restaurant with a good reputation and it holds up over time. I highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner or their awesome desserts",2
"My first visit was very quick, doctor got the sample of my skin and I had an appointment for the next week to remove the stitches and learn about my diagnosis, at least, that was what doctor told me. n nWhen I came back following week, I asked desk assistant, if I need to pay for my visit. She replied that I needn't because it is a continuation of my previous visit. I didn't get a call with my diagnosis before this visit, so asked the nurse about my diagnosis and what doctor thought about my condition. Doctor came in and told me that I have a rare incurable disease. His tone rather calm and unsympathetic, as if all I got was a flu. I was shocked by my diagnosis and doctor's unprofessional attitude, I expected a little more compassion. n nIn one month after last visit, I received a bill. After several calls and their promises to call me back next day which they never did, I called the billing. Very rude lady explained to me that the reason why they changed their mind and decided to bill me is because I had a ""discussion with the doctor "". I couldn't believe that being curious about my diagnosis after one week wait can cost that much, given they didn't call me with my diagnosis. I didn't receive any apologies for their inconsistency, just a threat ""Next time, if you discuss something with a doctor, you'll be charged for that. "" n nNo, no next time for Omni. That's a shame that Dr. Racette turned out to be such a heartless scam artist.",1
"My husband and I and our 2 daughters, age 8 and 16, at here on Valentine's day. We were very impressed! The food was DELISCIOUS and the sevice was suberb! Everyone from our waiter to the cook were very professional and friendly. The cook entertained the kids and made us all laugh. Our glasses were always full. Even at the end, the manager came and shook our hands and asked us how our dinner was. It is a little pricey, but you get a lot of food for the money, and keep in mind that part of what you are paying for is the experience. They also usually have a coupon available in the Money Mailer. We will definatelt be back!",2
I paid 100 to have my car detailed. When I got home I found this strange white substance on the driver's door and rear panel. I realized it was probably the tire dressing that was flung on the door when it was being applied. I didn't see it in the bright sun. When I got home I had to scrap it off with my nail and get a rag to buff the rest off. I expect to NOT clean my own car after paying 100. Will never go back there again.,1
"If your desperately hungry for great food, hungover, thirsty for booze and don't care about waiting a little for a table then this the place! Excellent drinks that match the size of their food BIG. Came here for brunch and it was fantastico! n nI had the sage fried chicken and waffles with maple syrup reduction. My tastebuds were in overload my foodie friends. Imagine bacon strips cooked iNSIDE the waffles yummy. The the fried chicken was moist, flavorful and out of this world and I'm not a fried chicken fan. Nevermind that I could not finish even half of it. My husband had the biscuits and sausage with gravy. That was heavenly with the sausage so tender and delish that you can't resist it. The biscuits did get a little hard after a bit but all is forgiven because of the gravy and eggs sitting in a beautiful cloudy fluff! The drive off the strip for this place is worth while and the waiter bartender Randy is absolutly awesome! Place was packed but he made sure to check on us to see if we needed more drinks, update us on the wait for the food and if we needed anything else. Best bargain in town for what you get on your plate. Who needs the buffets in Vegas when you have hash house a go go! You must go my friends for a hip foodie experience that will leave your tastebuds in overdrive.",2
"Stayed here for 3 nights when I was in Vegas to get married. The rates were awesome in December and since we planned on venturing off the strip quite a bit, it had great access to the interstate without having to drive on barely any of Las Vegas Blvd. n nWe did not gamble at all, so I have nothing to say about the casino, but it seemed much more open and airy than a lot of the other ones we walked through. n nAll the staff I encountered were very nice and pleasant. The room we had was very clean and had a nice TV and a great view of the strip and the roller coaster. n nI haven't stayed at any other hotel casinos to compare it to, but there was nothing I could really complain about. n nThe only thing I noted about the other hotel casinos on the strip that I may have liked better was that they had more ""cheaper "" food options.",2
"Lola isn't the coffee shop I visit most often mostly because they don't stay open late but they do have my favorite drink, The Matador. Often imitated, but never as good, The Matador is truly delicious. I wish they stayed open later than 7.it's such a bummer they don't.",2
"Oh Pin Kaow, do you ever do wrong? I hope not, because it's all been great so far. This location is next to my work, Pin Kaow 1 near my house, and it's all delicious no matter where in the valley! n nTheir decor is just as rad as their other locations it's like a bit of Thailand has slipped through the strip mall paradise of this Henderson commercial center. And their outdoor patio is nice maybe not in 106, but it's nice when it's not en fuego outside. n nLast visit I had a great chicken satay and a green curry that was savory to say the least. Great portions. My only sad moment was when the appetizer was a dollar less than the entree. Ouch! n nStill, a delightful establishment.",2
"Five Guys is so good. Have to admit that the first time I tried them I was not to impressed but on subsequent visits I have grown to really like them. It seems there is a big Five Guys Vs In N Out thing going on but I don't thing you can compare them. they each have there own unique taste. Plus I don't want to choose on over the other. They are both great. nNow Five Guys is just a little more expensive but just a little and it is so worth it. Also just a tip unless you really love french fries just order the small because they pile more than enough into the bag. Which is great but why pay for a large when you get enough with a small unless of course you want a ton of fries. nI know they have hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches but I haven't been able to get by the burgers yet. They are so good. I get it ""all the way "" except leave off the grilled mushrooms unless I am in the mood for them. Also a warning their regular burgers are doubles so unless you like double burgers make sure you let them know you want a single. nBut the menu is fairly simple and you can get anything made the way you want it. Also if you want to hang out and eat there they have free peanuts. nThe staff is always really nice. You can see them make your food and the place is always clean. Just wish it was a little cheeper so I could eat there more often. nThey also get an extra point because they have a Coke Freestyle machine.",2
"The food served at this establishment is fair at best, I am not giving this place a good review except for the following. nThey sell a selection of home made pies that is out of this world! Chocolate Cream, Peanut butter, Coconut Cream, etc. Believe me, you won't find better pie anywhere! They would be better off shutting down the restaurant and opening up as a bakery! nThere is a server there named Kelly! Someone that owns a really good restaurant should try to snap her up, as she is an excellent server with an awesome personality, a big smile, remembers your name and what you order! Very skilled at her job!",1
"One of my favorite spots in Central Phoenix! They have an ever changing beer menu and with each change, the beer is getting better and more interesting!

I will be back, and have been back several times.",2
"My husband and i bought 2 groupons here for mani pedi. The lady that was there, yes only 1 lady on a saturday!, was a russian lady who not only was rude on the phone but once I got there I realized nothing was cleaned! I am a licensed hair dresser and was appalled at how dirty this place is. She used the same heel scrubber on my foot as she did my husband with no attempt to clean it. The tools she used on my mani were still sitting on the dirty paper towel from the lady before me. Her attempt at sanitation was to dip it in the sanitizer. Should be soaked for 10 min! I am so afraid I am going to get some flesh eating disease from the nasty conditions of this place. I really dont know why I didnt leave. DO NOT GO HERE",1
"AWESOME PLACE! Great venue inside and outside. If you are a beer drinker like me this is the place for you. They have a HUGE Beer list. Now off to the food, the food is amazing I am serious everything on this menu is FANTASTIC! The green bean casserol and mac and cheese is a must and the ""Lil bit of everything "" is a good starter if its your first time there.",2
"For some reason, I had an incredible urge for cookies the other day, and didn't feel like getting one from Paradise Bakery, Wildflower, or a supermarket. I wanted something less chain y, commercial, and more homemade without having to make 'em myself, of course . Thanks to the magic of Yelp, I found the Chocolate Star Bakery, located within a reasonable distance from my office. n nThe place is in an unassuming shopping center, and I nearly drove right past it it's a small storefront, one of those places that's 9 10ths kitchen and food making area, which is almost always a good sign for a bakery. A fellow from the back room came up and helped me almost immediately, offering good suggestions on which varieties to try. n nI wound up getting a dozen different cookies, and all of them were quite tasty on the same ""this is a darn good cookie "" level that makes picking a favorite nigh impossible. Even after some of them sat, uneaten and unloved in my refrigerator for close to two weeks, when I got to them, they still tasted fresh, with no staleness to speak of. n nI just bought another dozen as a part of a belated holiday present for my parents, and have heard rave reviews from them as well. This might not sound like much, but my dad is pretty much a ""pie or cake or nothin' "" kind of guy, and my mom usually avoids sweets that aren't straight up chocolate. n nThe only warning I would give is that at 1.50 each, the price seems a little steep, given the size and the fact that these are, well, cookies. So if you're on a budget and are looking for quantity over quality, this shop might not be right for you. But if you're willing to splurge a bit more on some fantastic cookies, give Chocolate Star a try.",2
"After all of the high reviews, I figured it would be a good place to try out. As I was entering the restaurant, I stopped someone who was leaving with leftovers, that's a good sign. I asked how his experience was. He was less then enthusiastic about the food and service. That was not a good sign. n nThe sign says, ""seat yourself. "" I looked for a good spot to sit and found a table near where other were seated. I found that it had food particles on it and a few napkins. One of the two only active waitresses came by and asked me to go sit on some waiting chairs. I waited while a waitress went to clean the table. n nOnce it was clean, she waved me over and I sat down. The seats are nice, no arms, and the temperature was quite cool on a hot Summer 100 degree plus day. Though I did smell cigarette smoke from the bar next door. n nThe waitress came by and asked to take my drink order. It was delivered in a fairly large cup, water usually comes by thimble size in restaurants these days, so that was nice. n nThen it was time to order an entree. I opted for the Two Meat Combo for 18.99 which comes with two sides. I asked the waitress what were her most ordered sides. She said the sweet potato crumble and mac cheese. So I ordered those along with a 1 4 chicken and ribs. n nMy previous experience with BBQ in Las Vegas stems from many visits to Ellis Island's BBQ and Famous Dave's. Both places serve large meals for good prices. So I was expecting more than what I received and after a pretty good wait. n nFor 18.99 I received two ribs and a quarter chicken plus the sides I mentioned above. The temperature of sides were adequate. The sweet potato crumble was initially delicious, after some time, it became too much for me to finish. The other person I went with ordered a potato salad, which was much better. The mac cheese was tasty. The chicken and ribs should have been super hot. They were slightly warm to the touch, not what I was looking for. The person I went with also ordered the 1 4 chicken. It too was slightly warm, but not hot. n nThe person I went with got their 1 4 chicken and two sides for 10.99. How can they justify two ribs for an extra 8? n nOur waitress was nice, the water tasted clean and the sides were good. The temperature needs to be turned up a lot on the meat served and I unfortunately ended up smelling like a cigarette.",1
"One of the top three gift giving sites on the Internet. The products they sell are available at http www.wisconsincheeseman.com , and unlike wine country gift baskets, you really get your money's worth of product and not just packaging.

"Oh. My. God. Friends had been telling me that we should try Macayo's. They said it was good Mexican food. I finally tried it. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler and I'm not kidding, the sauce tasted like the crap they used to give us at elementary school and call enchiladas. That is EXACTLY what it reminded me of. Blech. I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. How have they been in business for so long?",1
"Kinda gross that the cook had his hair loose. Also, the nachos weren't all that flavorful. Def not worth 8.",1
"I had been a regular here and placed fairly decent sized take out orders weekly. The food is always good although they don't always get substitutions right. Since substitutions are sometimes about allergies that isn't super. nAnyway, I had not been here in a few months because I got really tired of how terrible the young girls taking the orders over the phones were. I decided I would give it another chance and called tonight around 4 30 to place a take out order. I gave Whitney my name and was about to place my order when I was asked if I could hold. 5 minutes later I was still holding and I hung up. nManagement, train your employees on customer service. I doubt I am the only business you are losing! nIt's really sad too when you love a restaurants sushi but the employees can't take a take out order and treat customers properly at off hours. nGuess next time I'm craving RA I will be driving to old town.

"I've only been dining out for 34 years, but our trip to Buca today Christmas Day was the WORST dining experience I have ever had. n nIt started with us making our reservation online. That was seamless as there were plenty of reservations available. Once we got to Buca Arrowhead, while we were waiting to be seated, 4 different people were turned away because they did not have a reservation, even though there were reservations available online and plenty of empty tables. As business owners ourselves, we were shocked to see so much money walking out the door for no reason. However, after our experience, I'm thinking that those folks who were turned away were the lucky ones. n nWe ordered salad. The lettuce was brown, but we decided to let that go. 30 minutes after we were seated, our 4 year old son's pizza was brought out. 30 minutes after that, we still did not have our food. Our son had long finished eating and was bored. Our waitress visited the tables around us 4 times but never checked on us, refilled our long emptied drinks or given us an update on the status of our food. But all that aside, our food had FINALLY arrived so we figured we'd dish up and eat fast. However I guess our food had sat in the back too long. Our baked ziti was cold and our daughter's chicken parm was rock hard and her noodles were cold. We had to get up to go find our waitress at which point she took our food back. Then a manager came to our table and said, ""Sorry about that. We'll reheat that for you "" and he walked away. REHEAT? Seriously? He didn't even pause long enough to give us a chance to say if we even wanted our food reheated.or I don't know.replaced. I had to chase him down to tell him that our 4 year old was not going to wait for us to get new food and then wait for us to eat it. He offered me no solution and did not ask what he could do to make it better. I finally said, that we would like our salad and our son's pizza comped and that we would be leaving. n nNot that I need to tell anyone how to do their job, but from our point of view, had we been given a little attention and concern and not had to come up with a solution on our own, we would have gladly paid for our whole meal. We left and our Christmas dinner ended having to be fast food. Thanks for nothing Buca Arrowhead.",1
"Okay, so Mandalay Bay was not my first choice but I was excited to stay because they have so many pool and their restaurant selection is awesome. Low and behold, there is a rain and thunderstorm forecast for the weekend I wanted. Oh well, the big perk was the deal I got had early check in and late check out. Little did I know how much a pain in the butt that was going to be n nUpon checking in, I made sure that we still had the late checkout. The front desk man said ""Yes, you have until 4pm Great. Sunday rolls around and after lunch, we go back to our room and of course, the key doesn't work. So we have to go all the way back down to the front desk and wait in their long ass line to get it fixed. Brandy, our ""front desk helper "" was so incredibly rude I couldn't look at her when I left. After telling her I MADE sure we had a 4 pm checkout she still probed me as if I was CHEATING her, as if I didn't really have a late check out and i was trying to weasle my way into more time at their crappy ass hotel. She even asked "" did you take your luggage out? "" and AFTER I said no she proceeded to tell me ""sometimes the cleaning ladies see its clear and then assumed you checked out "" so I said, ""That's impossible "" Any idiot can take one step into that room and see there were two big luggages and my stuff was everywhere. Even so, does that mean.oh okay lets deactivate your card even though you paid for the late checkout? Brandy did not even apologize for the inconvenience or the mixup. She took her sweet time interrogating me and making me wait. And then to top it off, when i went back upstairs the cleaning lady pulled me aside to ask me when I was checking out and I said 4pm and she said "" AY YI YI, did u tell front desk!?! "" umm.yes because I paid for it! At this time I just wanted to leave because they were all breathing down my neck. n nI wish I could say that was an isolated even of rudeness. But no, the bad service was even on the phone. I was given a letter saying ""please check ur balance on the TV so you can take care of it before you leave "" So as a obedient patron, I did as such. Of course the TV doesnt have that option and it say ""call front desk "" So i call front desk and explain the situation and she goes ""you do it on the TV "" and I say the TV doesnt work and she says "" Well thats the only way "" okay.well thats why I am calling you . just doing what Im told! she tells me she will reset it, but nope nop this never gets done. n nMandalay Bay is getting old. It once was a nice place to stay but no longer. The spa is really showing its age as well. Their jets werent working, the robes had big ol holes in them, they even ran out of clean towels,cmon people you are a SPA you need plenty of clean towels. nThe pool is looking run down too. It was way too crowded to feel liek a relaxing getaway, and this was when it was cloudy and 60 70 degrees. n nNeedless to say, I wont stay here again. I will only come back for the delicious food restaurants.",1
"Not too bad! I live within walking distance from China a Go Go and have ordered from here several times. Even though I usually order to go, the staff is still very friendly. They have online ordering available so that's a bonus. And orders are usually prepared pretty fast, within 10 minutes. n nI've tried the Chicken Fried Rice and Pork Fried Rice 5.95 . They are average.I prefer the chicken. Both are a bit oily, but still good. The Chicken Wings 8 for 6.25 are better, but a bit pricey for what they are. They are delicious though! One order of fried rice and chicken wings should be plenty for two people, or for one dinner and a midnight snack. n nTIP There is plenty of lettuce garnish peppers that come with the wings, kind of like a mini salad. It's pretty flavorful and spicy, so I'd recommend saving it with the leftovers and add your own ramen or small bowl of rice. Good for a small snack! n nI've lived in this area for nearly 20 years and the same spot has changed ownership businesses several times the other businesses weren't that great . I wouldn't mind if this particular business is here to stay. If you live in the same zip code, I'd recommend trying this place at least once.",2
"Our little family has been so pleased having Bruce Okun as our dentist over many years! He is such a kind, warm man and certainly is an expert dentist! Now we also have the distinct pleasure of his daughter Amy having joined the practice! We are now assured of continued dental care by a Doctor Okun!",2
"Been a patient there for many years. There staff is getting worst and worst with very little or nil customer service skills. Trying to get a message to the doctor is like going through a mine field.many different layers of rude staff asking the same questions and the doctor doesn't call you back! Good heath care? Questionable! Not a happy customer of SEVG.will be talking to my primary doc to stop referring patient to SEVG hereafter. Please understand there are some nice people that work there but the front office staff that greets you and takes calls, they all suck! and I am being nice!",1
"Typically this place is great but sadly enough we will never be back to Bass Pro due to the horrid experience we received. After driving an hour to take our 1yo son 3yo daughter to see Santa we were told its a 6 hour wait. It would be understandable if they would Inform customers about there obnoxious wait time. To make things worse we brought this issue to management spoke to Carly she was extremely rude could care less that we drove an hour kept making excuses about how we should have called ahead of time even though we did we could not get through to anyone that knew the wait time. This is a great marketing strategy to get people in the door but in the end you lost a Customer complete respect from us. It's sick knowing managers like Carly can even hold that position due to her disrespect and lack of care. The best part about the situation is we spoke to one of the employees at the start of the line ""whom was very polite "" he mentioned that the issue has been brought up to management there corporate office it has not been addressed. This negative review would not even exist if management would have just acknowledge the issue apologized instead of making excuses roiling there eyes. Thanks Carly",1
This has to be the WORST company. I had to use this place due to my ac breaking and the warranty company made me use them. They first show up way early from the time we booked. Then they make an appointment with me and don't show up for it. I'll never use this place again.,1
"Feeling Ripped Off. n nI went through the drive through this morning and ordered the 1 breakfast combo 2 donuts and a regular size coffee .supposed to be 3.39 according to the menu board. I was charged 4.60. I stewed over it all day.should have turned around and went back to talk to the manager no matter how busy they were, but I was in a hurry and already late for work. n n 4.60 is outrageous for two simple donuts and regular coffee, but even the advertised price of 3.39 plus tax seems high. n nWith regard to the donuts the Boston Creme didn't have much filling. The French Crueller was top notch, as was the coffee but not worth the price paid. If I need a quick donut fix not very often at all any more , I'll take my business to the local Circle K or grocery store.figure I can get the same effect with about 3.00 elsewhere.",1
"Shame on me for not double checking my take out order before leaving, but they left two items out of the bag. At first I thought that it was an honest mistake, but when I called to explain what happened they said they were sorry and there was nothing that they could do. n nIt could have been a language barrier issue but I think they knew what happened and just decided not to offer to deliver the items that they left out and not refund the missed items. n nFinally, the food was significantly worse than the How Lee in Squirrel Hill and next time I will simply drive the extra two miles to get better food.",1
"My first time at Old Fashioned was on a date. I ordered the Old Fashioned House Burger per my date's recommendation. It came with a choice of a side either fries or a side salad. I went with the fries, which were thinly cut, nicely salted and crisp. The fries were delicious, but they were not the star of my plate. The burger came with a beautifully fried egg precariously balanced atop a patty smeared with garlic sauce, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, and bacon. It was a beautiful sight. I added lettuce and tomato and then gently placed the top toasted bun, and with slow and steady pressure smushed and watched that egg yolk dribble down the side of my burger. n nMy first bite was amazing the saltiness of the bacon, the creaminess of that egg yolk, and the cheese and onions, so good. It was a messy burger, and I surely looked a mess halfway through it, yolk and garlic sauce dribbling down my chin. Did I mention I was on a first date? At some point, the thought that maybe I should put this burger down and try to be attractive on this date occurred to me, but it was fleeting. This was a delicious burger and my date paled in comparison. There was no second date, but I will forever be in his debt for introducing me to this burger. n nI've since been to the Old Fashioned many times, and often times just for drinks as well. They have a crazy selection of craft brews 50 some on tap, and another 100 bottled , and there's always a tap that's on special for really cheap. It's a great way to sample craft brews. And of course, they serve their namesake, the Old Fashioned. Here, you get to fashion your own Old Fashioned, making choices for the kind of liquor, bitters, mixer and garnish. If you prefer customizations to be done by the bartender, there is also a variety of Old Fashioneds like Apple Jack and Orange Rum. n nAnd if you happen to not be a burger person, they do offer many other kinds of sandwiches and Fish Fry Wednesdays and Fridays.",2
"This place is steeped in history. You can feel it seeping through the rich dark drapes and ornate furnishings, oozing from the ancient edifice and every dim corner. This is one of the oldest buildings in Montreal 3rd oldest, I was told . My wife and I were invited here for an official dinner, and we were impressed by the ambience and decor. And of course our host regaled us with the history of Montreal, including les filles du roi daughters of the king . n nDefinitely a place to consider if one is organizing a formal dinner. Or a romantic evening. The place speaks for itself. I like the spaciousness, with only a few tables in each room, which meant one can carry on conversations at a decent volume and not have to shout. n nI had the grilled salmon which was decent. Service was unobtrusive and servers were polite. n nGiven that street parking in Old Montreal is always a nightmare, one of the advantages this restaurant has is its proximity less than 5 min walk to the car park at the Clocktower Quay where there is ample parking. Parking is 12 but it's better than circling the streets of cobbled stones endlessly on a cold night.",2
"AWFUL. I had to give myself a few days of cool down to write this review otherwise I think I may have dropped a lot of ""f "" bombs. so unclassy. just like this place! If i could give this place zero stars I would. nMy friend and I wondered here this past weekend in the hopes of getting some decent margaritas. we were so wrong. we were seated by a girl who didn't seem to like her job. pretty bland. it was whatever. we looked over our menus and the margaritas looked pretty good so we ordered one each at 7 dollars a glass. I asked for a not so sweet and sour one, but a stronger one with more flavor so the waitress recommended one to me. While she put that order in my friend and I decided to share some basic beef taquitos for 8 dollars. She dropped off some free chips and salsa which were nothing too impressive. the 3 choices of salsa all tasted the same pretty much and were bland. so sad. Our drinks came over and I took one sip and already felt sick from all the sweet and sour. It tasted like a virgin drink. I'm sorry.I'm 27.don't you remember checking my ID while I asked for something of the opposite? I did not say bring me a virgin margarita. open your ears. My friend was not impressed either with his frozen margarita which tasted like frozen lemon water. UGH what is this place?! our taquitos came over and they looked like they were from the freezer isle at target. believe me when I say there was no beef whatsoever in this little things. there were 3 of them and they were the size of my boney little pinky finger. 8 dollars for what?! OMG. unimpressed. When the waitress came over to ask how our drinks were I told her mine was too sweet and I didn't like it as I moved it to the side for her to take away after one sip. obviously she didn't get the hint as she watched me and walked away. umm alright. she brought our check over and I noticed our drinks were 8 dollars while on the menu they were 7 dollars so I decided to ask her about this. She said they charge an extra dollar for the alcohol. nowhere on that menu did it say they were going to charge more money for a drink that already has alcohol in it. WTF! yes.I understand it is only an extra dollar per drink but it is the point of telling your customers about this before they order. I didn't even drink my margarita because it was disgusting and wanted you to take it away but instead you decide you want to charge me more for it?! not to mention your food sucked and was such a disappointment. I left this place so angry and upset over this. The waitress offered no help and it was obvious she wanted us out of there. nI'm apparently still very angry over this about half a week later. I will make sure none of my friends and family ever go to this place. I really hope they do not stay around too long and are replaced by something better. I am so let down with mi casa's food and service.",1
"Awful! nMy husband has been a patient for awhile, and I am so sick of fighting for weeks just to get someone to call me back, or to respond to a pharmacy refill request! Awful customer service! Walgreens has been contacting them for 5 days now for our refill with NO response. I tried to call and the phone just goes to a busy signal. I left messages for all doctors. No response. Very very annoying. I guess they don't care if they keep patients.",1
"I didn't really like this place. The food was really overpriced. Not shocking for a strip restaurant. The filet mignon sliders were the best thing we had. The nachos were all right, but everything else we ate was really bad. I didn't like the shrimp appetizer or the steak frites. That was the worst steak frites I've ever had. Service was ok.",1
"If you are craving Chinese buffet, this is not the place that I would recommend. Sure, there is a large variety of items to choose from. However, the food is terrible. Some of the items seemed to be on the inedible side. n nI wouldn't have gone here for several reasons, if it were not because it is a mecca for tour bus and there were no other restaurants in the same shopping center. 1 The price for Sunday lunch was too expensive. 14.99 for Sunday buffet? That's outrageous. 2 The service. They obviously could not handle a sudden rush of folks. That's the unusual part as I am sure that tour buses stop here at least once a week. 3 I would have chosen to eat for the same or cheaper price at a off the strip buffet restaurant. And 4 The A C wasn't on. With the weather outside in the 90's. Are you crazy? n nBTW, I ate at this restaurant two months ago. The only reason that I still remember the dreadful experience is that it is in Las Vegas, one of the buffet meccas.",1
"Somehow, the husband and I have managed to pass this place like a million times, never even noticing its presence. This Saturday we decided to give it a go, arriving at about 10 55 to eat some breakfast. Uh Oh. The menu says they don't serve breakfast after 11 and I was about to get really angry because of the lack of food in my belly but our server was super sweet and said breakfast wouldn't be a problem. YAY! n nWe both ordered the breakfast bowls, and I got mine with bacon. While waiting for our food, the husband and I made plenty of snide remarks about how this had to be better than the Two Hippies Crappy Breakfast Dumb. Sure enough, it was soooooo much better. First of all, our food wasn't served in environmentally unfriendly styrofoam. Second, it was actually in a BOWL! Imagine that! I dug my fork in and got a nice helping of potatoes, cheesy goodness, fluffy egg, and delicious bacon. The bite was simply wonderful. The potatoes were super crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy inside. There were not one, but TWO layers of ooey gooey cheese in that bowl, making an ordinary dish extraordinary. n nNow, don't get me wrong. this is not the world's greatest breakfast, but it is pretty freakin good. The service was friendly. The food was fresh, non greasy, and delicious. My favorite part of all though, would have to be the no nonsense diner attitude. Give it a try!",2
"Just moved to this area and decided to come here for some grocery shopping.

If you ever get the chance to see a comedy act I would say please pick this place over the other big one I know of in Tempe. n nThey have great staff and a beautiful club and if you are done there and want to do something else there is all sorts of things going on in Downtown Phoenix and it's all with in walking distance of the club, like Copper blue right next door. n nHad a great time there!",2

I would so like Victor Hugo's to be better! It has all the ingredients but comes up short time and again. Brilliant location and essentially a good business model let down again and again by poor execution. Often freezing cold too as the door is left propped open in midwinter! nThe use of boards as trays or plate substitutes seems like a good idea they look nice until they plonk them down and spill your coffee they don't work! have you not noticed! This is after waiting 10 15 mins for said spilled coffee to arrive. In the freezing cold wind tunnel! Oh dear! Please sort it out.,1

"My first buffet experience in LV, pretty happy with it! Dinner on weekends comes out to be 42 after tax, so it's not a cheap dinner, but it seems like most of the other buffets eg Wynn fall in the same price point. n nThe food ranged from OK really tasty. A lot of the dishes use interesting fancy ingredients, probably to make the buffet experience more worth it. I tried a handful of things I've never had before calve's liver, wild boar sloppy joe, fois gras macaron? which made dinner pretty fun. Most of the dishes are displayed in small portions for you to grab and go, which I found super convenient, especially for a buffet style restaurant. My method was to go through and grab one thing of everything I was interested in before I started eating, so I could gauge better what was worth a second go super smart on me. n nI think they probably have a rotating menu, but quality is probably the same throughout the year, I'd rate it a 3.8 5. The prime rib usually a big thing at these Vegas buffets I know was just ok. n nDefinitely worth trying! I heard that dinner on a weekday is only 30.",2
"I went in to use my upgrade for my iPhone4s to just get the same exact phone because I am perfectly content with this specific model, making the final purchase of my new phone 0.00. ""Awesome! "" I thought. When I looked at my bill for February just to mentally prepare and affirm the quota like very other month , it said I owed 101.70, when I usually owe 46.03. Because I purchased 10 insurance, I expected my bill to be approximately 56.03. My thoughts, ""Holy crap! What? "" I spent 40 minutes on the phone with Verizon asking why my bill was so high and they explained to me that when you upgrade a phone, you are charged a 30.00 service fee. I accepted this, but the fact that the sales associate, Levy, did not express this to me, it worried me and wasted time on the phone I honestly did not have. A representative of Verizon connected herself and I, and Levy from this location, on a 3 way call so that we can ask exactly why my bill is so high, and he was very rude to me. I do not recommend going to this location if you are a shopper looking for excellent customer service. Although I affirmed with Levy that there will not be any additional charges, it was clearly not true. n nAdvice for future phone shoppers Ask about service fees when upgrading phones! .and of course, additional charges before spending any money. n nI hope this review helps!",1
"This place rocks.it's simply the best neighborhood bar, with the greatest old timers hanging out there. I always enjoy my food, my drinks and the company no one drinks alone here.

"Update n nI find it absolutely amazing that a person can pass away at their facility then one day short of 7 weeks later, someone from that facility is calling for the deceased, asking to speak with them regarding paperwork that needs to be completed. n nThat's definitely a textbook procedure of making sure the family of the deceased isn't reminded of the passing n nAlso just goes to show how uninvolved the clinical nursing staff was with my dad's brief stay and passing at this facility. Seeing as no one from that facility gave me nor my family any attention that they would miss that someone actually passed away, or who it was. n nI'd save a copy of the voice mail and send it to the facility administrators or the risk management team however, with the attitudes and behavior I witnessed from their staff there that night and now with the voice mail I just listened to I'm sure they wouldn't care. n nI'm moving on and putting this all behind me after this review. I'd suggest that you just keep moving on if you ever find this place as an option for care for yourself, anyone you know or love and even your enemies.",1

Beautiful Hotel! Went here for my birthday in April did I mention it was my 40th! A little late doing reviews. Anyhow our stay was fabulous! We has our own concierge and check in area that was something I have never experienced! Very sweet! Extremely curtious staff and the decor at the hotel was to die for! Our room was a suite and again nothing that I have ever experienced! I must not get out to much ! Anyhow a great place to spend a weekend. They have a beautiful pool area in fact they have a european bathing pool as well which I think is topless which is sorta fun. To bad we got to busy to do that! I would defiantly tell anyone and everyone to stay here.,2

Only goo dthing was the Hageen Daaz strawberry shake.YUM O in my Rachel Ray voice .Sorry SmashBurger.",1
I got a pedicure from here yesterday. I was not happy. Jeannie didn't cut my cuticles very well so I could see there was a space between the polish and my toenail.

"I gave this place two chances to prove itself, but they have failed me. Visited this place when all the hype came about but was severely disappointed in both the size and taste of these tacos. Yes, I know they are street tacos and they run small, but I had to order 20 just to get a good fill, so I decided to order every kind of taco they had. I wish I could tell you what those tacos tasted like, but they all lacked flavor .literally no flavor. n nI'm quite shocked at the reviews raving about the best tacos around.clearly these tacos do not fit in any kind of a ""good "" category.",1

Worst experience ever pulled in needed lug nuts tightened on my truck and they don't even carry a lug wrench to tighten my lug nobody was even working and they did not even take the slightest bit effort to try to help me get my family back on the road!

"The Big Earl cheeseburgers today were VERY pink inside and dry as a bone. 35 for 3 dry, under cooked cheeseburgers and fries that tasted as if they had been sitting for hours. The best thing about our meal was the chocolate shakes. For the money, Joey's of Chicago on Carefree Hwy has a much better burger that runs down your elbow and the fries are out of this world! They even have delicious milk shakes so why bother going back to Big Earl's. Joey's of Chicago is clean, has a much larger seating area and the staff is always friendly.

"It may be smaller than some of the other LV strip clubs, but I just love it! I don't think pretty, well dressed ladies me! accompanied by a well dressed good looking husband should be charged cover, but they do charge! That's not the only problem I have with this club. The cocktails are not very strong, and the cocktail waitresses are a little bit aggressive when it comes to bringing more of them. Having said that, the girls are beautiful, friendly, and not adverse to couples when it's the lady who wants the lap dance. Additionally, they actually dance when they're on stage! Not a bored looking dancer there! Love the effects, the neon, the fog machine, it's all very old school and great! We've not been there on a weekend night, but during the week it's not too crowded yeah, Spearmint Rhino, I'm talkin' about you so it makes for a pleasant, relaxing, comfortable experience. nIn conclusion, I highly suggest anyone looking for a good time with beautiful girls, hit Treasures!",2

"Yes, I ended up joining another gym. Mountainside has a few things my other gym does not have. I love several of their classes and that is a good thing because I am easily bored. I also love that they provide you with towels, so I don't have to worry about packing them for a work out or even for showering, which makes it easier. The gym is small, but efficient. I am not crazy about their treadmills, but I will get over it, or use the other gym for that. I guess I can count this one as another Groupon winner.",2

"My gf gives it a 5, but I think it is closer to a 3, so this post is a 4. The menu is a bit limiting. I have eaten a fair amount of Caribbean food, and I while I thought this place was good for Phoenix, I was not all that impressed. Most of the food was tasty, but the vegetable sides that came with the meals were just cabbage and simple peppers, WTF! No flavor! And the dumplings looked like something I wouldn't want anywhere near my food. It nearly spoiled my appetite. And maybe they shouldn't stress how much everything is localy grown and organic. It's a Jamaican restaurant in Phoenix! How local could it be? Well, that point was answered when our waiter had to clarify the locality of a few items. One more thing, what is up with the 5 bottle opening fee?! I was going to bring a bottle until I read that. n nI am sure to eat here again. If the menu changes seasonally and they introduce some new items throughout the year, I will probably revise my review to be a little more favorable. If nothing changes, I will take the rating to a 3.",2

"Buyer beware! nI brought a computer here that would not power up, and told them I suspected the power supply. nThe owner told me the supply was bad, and also the motherboard was bad and had blown caps.

The only problem with the computer was the easily replaced 30 power supply. There were no blown caps, no problem at all. nThat's not upsell. That's lying, and that's just plain dishonest. nThe transfer of data to the new computer was incomplete, even though the old hard drive was perfectly good. n nI took teamlogicIT's owner to small claims court based on fraud. nThe owner told the judge that the sale was based on his convincing me that my computer was old and needed to be upgraded He said these things, but but the only reason I upgraded was the supposedly bad motherboard. He also said, among other things, that it's impractical to measure voltage at the motherboard Tell that to a beginner computer technician! There's this great big connector.

We went on a weekend evening. The restaurant is located on a high floor with a a nice view of Las Vegas. You check in at a desk on the main floor and ride the elevator to the restaurant exiting into a dark area. You need to navigate through the dark bar lounge area to get to a well lit restaurant dining room. The service was excellent. The lobster au curry was also excellent. There is an extensive wine list as well.,2

"I normally like BWW for beer and wings but this one is pretty terrible. The service is poor, upon arriving there was a wait, so the girl asked if we wanted inside or outside I asked what the waits were for each and she said 10 for inside and about 20 for outside. I put us down for inside so it would come up quicker, then several people came up behind us and were seated before us, on the patio. Weird. So we are seated and we order beers and appetizers garlic mushrooms and the mushrooms came before the beer. And they were tiny. I tasted no mushrooms in the breading, and I've had them before and they haven't been like that. By the time I got my beer I was so thirsty I drank it all before my wings came. Then my mango habenero wings came, and no beer. So while waiting for my next beer my songs got cold. Bad experience, bad meal, if we do ever go back to a BWW it won't be this one.",1
"Okay, so I finally decided it was time to get rid of my old flip phone and upgrade to a smartphone. I was super excited. My grandmother and Iare on a family plan together and she lives in Tucson. She mailed me my phone and was told that I can just go to a Sprint Store up here and have it activated. I took my phone into this store and the associate, I think his name was John, told me in order to access the account, he needed the pin or the answer to the security question. I didn't know either and I used the store's phone to call my grandma since sprint had turned off my service a couple days before and my grandma was giving me a lot of answers that were not the right ones. I was really upset and couldn't believe that this was so difficult. I asked to speak to someone else and he said that they would tell me the same thing. At this point, I'm the only customer in the store and two other associates are wandering around and I know they can tell I'm upset. Neither of them came over and offered to help at all.He told me that my grandmother had to call customer service to reset the password. Well, that's a whole other story. Well, at the end of the day when I met up with my husband after he had a few beers he took my phone played around on it for literally less than a minute and magically, it was activated. n nI can't believe that this person is in customer service. He is an idiot and should be fired. When I was extremely upset, he showed no emotion at all and couldn't help me at all. n nThe next day, my husband and I went into this exact same sprint store, to get my contacts transferred over and I just wish that guy had been there. We did however, let one of the managers know of the situation the day before. I'm not sure if anything will be done about it. n nIt's best to avoid this store.",1
Wish I could say better but we have tried 3 or 4 times since the opened every time the same slow service I'm not sure the have a heat lamp in back cause the food comes out in the order it was cooked so my pizza would come out then 10 minutes later my wife cheeseburger in the mean time you sit there with the waitress passing you by and your drinks are empty. We gave it multiple try's figuring there were some things the needed to work out from being new but food not coming out at the same time for only 2 people? Not sure if there understaffed or poorly managed? Last night we went again and same thing slow service no drinks when you ordered one it took 10 minuets to get it. We ordered cheese garlic bread I had chicken wings. It took fore ever for the appetizer it finally showed up then a minute later the wings I thought they called it a appetizer for a reason? Then 5 min later my wife beef sandwich that literally had two slices of beef? My chicken wings were ok and I got a hole 4 inch piece of celery and the same with the carrot. I think they have potential but need to fix some things fast. The only positive thing I can say is that the atmosphere was good. I hope the fix this and we will try again as managing a business of my own I don't won't to see anyone fail. Good Luck,1
"My doggies and I absolutely love coming to this park. I have small dogs, so I like that they have a separate fenced in area for the little guys. The big dog area is enormous and fun to watch the retrievers and such go after balls in the water, but it gets a little rowdy over there at times. It's a great social activity for pets and pet parents. Glad to have this available for us to use.",2
"I wish there was some way to separate the people park from the dog park. And the pond. Because each aspect gets and entirely different rating. n nLet's review The Good, The Bad And the Ugly n nThe Good n nOverall, this is an amazing park. We've been to many Prides here and I've always been pleased with the amount of space that is available. Go back when nobody's there and you'll see just how expansive this park is. We went on a day when part of the park was flooded and the ducks were happily swimming and some guy's dog was just loving running through the puddles. 5 stars n nBut, the Ugly. n n.he was disobeying the leash laws that are posted. So what. His dog wasn't bothering our dogs or us, plus he or she looked to be having a splendid time. So, get over it. n nThe Bad n nDon't call what some company dug into the ground a lake. I grew up near Lake Erie, and that's a lake. I swam in Lake Michigan, and that's a lake. I took a ferry to Mackinac Island across Lake Huron. This isn't a lake and it's insulting to call it that. In fact, the Port O Johns at Pride smell about the same. So nasty. 2 stars n nThe Ugly n nAs I was reading the reviews, I was certain people were being dramatic. I mean, walking across the lush green lawns of this park, it's hard to imagine anything less. How truly disappointed I was. How utterly heartbroken I was. How completely ashamed of myself for dragging my dear Brady and Max to this gravel and feces covered sty. Maybe the designers of this space could have made a slightly more inviting locale by planting nothing but cacti. Cacti and broken glass to pave the way. And perhaps some poisonous plants. I heeded the warnings and filled up the water bowl at a fountain beforehand, but I should have tasted it first. Poor Brady would look up at me after every drink with his, ""Please, mommy. This is just gross "" look and I felt like a horrible parent for not bringing his chilled, filtered water. Never again! 1 star, because I cannot give the negative 5 stars this aspect of the park deserves. n nHonestly, with such an amazing space one would think the powers that be would expand the dog park and oxygenate the pond to help with the odor. Instead, we're left with a nice green park, a cesspool puddle and a dog park that clearly was intended to train warrior dogs for trips into the battle fields. n nNot for my kids, not for me.",1
"I love this store! Whenever I'm in the area ahem. grubbing at Yama I always make a stop here. I'm a big fan of their candle selection you can always find a scent you like in a good brand for half the price you'd spend buying it in a department store. n nI also keep an eye on their dutch ovens they have a nice selection from Cuisinart to Le Creuset! Wine glasses, vases, OXO storage items. I've also purchased a handful of really great finds in their apparel selection. n nThis place is heavenly!",2
"My husband and I took our honeymoon tour of Ireland and Scotland back in August of 2013. When we were in Ireland, preparing to depart for Edinburgh, my husband was consulting his Scotland guidebook and mentioned to me the tradition of ""high tea. "" It sounded excellent, so I looked online for places that offered a gluten free option for afternoon tea. The Scotsman had rave reviews and was the least expensive option, so we decided to stop there on our first day in Edinburgh after a long day of ""touristy "" things Holyrood and the Castle . We did not make a reservation, but stopped in around 3 30 in the afternoon. n nWe were very impressed with how classy everything seemed. We were ushered into a quiet room with a few other groups scattered around at different tables. It felt very sophisticated and was quite a fun experience. I ordered the gluten free option and my husband went with the regular. I had a pot of apple tea it was pink when I added the cream! When they brought the tray out, it didn't seem like a lot of food. The height was deceptive it's really a ton of food. I started with the finger sandwiches and worked my way up the tray. I liked most of the sandwiches, although I did not like one of the fish sandwiches, so I gave it to my husband. n nThe thing that really stood out for me was the scone. Oh, my God. The scone. To die for! It was slightly smaller than my husband's gluten filled counterpart, but the texture was phenomenal I was recently gluten free at that point . I smothered it with clotted cream and jelly and happily went to town on it. Last, but not least, were the desserts. I remember all of them being delicious, although I seem to recall that the gluten free tray had one less dessert than the regular tray. It didn't matter, though. We both left stuffed. You could have rolled me out of there. Our waiter came back when we were finished and seemed surprised that we finished our trays down to the last crumb. He came across as somewhat haughty and a little judgmental, but we didn't let that get in the way of our experience. We do our best when traveling internationally to be normal, quiet, and respectful the opposite of the American stereotype some people have . n nAnyway, the point is, definitely come here for tea if you're celiac or gluten intolerant or just gluten free by choice. It is so worth it. My husband loved his tea, too, so the regular must be just as good. It is worth every pence!",2
"I love most of the shops here including Bin 702. The playground is fun and the stage is awesome however my wife was unfairly picked out by a security guard named Mr. Jerry as ""looking suspicious "" this after she approached him to ask what time they close. I may return but SHE NEVER WILL. We called it GOTHIC PROFILING. Mr Jerry is Black. It's unfortunate that this put a damper on an otherwise awesome night.",1
"Very solid all around performance in the Plateau area my wife and I felt like we were a part of the scene and maybe away from other tourists since this was a relatively busy Friday night meal. n nWe tried the scallops with black pudding, the calamari and the ravioli appetizer, and a lamb shank main dish we wanted the pork chop, we were told it would be lamb that night, but it still tasted like pork to us! . All pretty tasty, nothing truly amazing, and the wine by the glass prices were close to reasonable. And warm bread served as a starter also worked well. Our server was very attentive and I love any place that lets me book on OpenTable.",2
"Edinburgh is one of the most attractive cities architecturally with buildings such as Edinburgh Castle, The Scott Monument and St Giles' Cathedral. So why oh why did the University of Edinburgh sanction the hideous eye sore that is Appleton tower? It really does look out of place and would look more apt in 1950s communist Russia. n nHowever, although it does look pretty disgusting from the outside, it is pretty cool inside, the lecture theatres are very much 21st century and very spacious and the tutorial rooms are all fitted with LCD TVs outside. Also one benefit from being inside Appleton Tower is that you can't see how ugly it is from the outside, so if you get a chance go to the top floor where you will be blessed with a beautiful panoramic view of the city.",1
Finally tried this place after many weeks of longing for a cronut. It is an old school neighborhood style donut shop. Several senior citizens in there that seemed to be regulars since the employee was sitting with them when I walked in. Promptly greeted and I told him it was my first visit. He gave me a run down on the favorite donuts. n nI ordered the creme filled cronut and the cherry filled donut burrito. The cronut just might be the best pastry or donut I have eaten. Certainly earns a place in my top 5. I really enjoyed the cherry burrito. Basically a sweet tortilla filled with cherry filling and fried then glazed with donut icing. Quite the yummy departure from a normal breakfast pastry. n nService I thought was great. Very friendly and helpful. Good enthusiasm for the product and someone new to the store. I will definitely be back and have placed the 19th donut hole on my regular rotation of donut shops on the east valley. Enjoy!,2
"This has been my ""go to "" post office since I moved into my current apartment a few years ago. Plenty of parking, a separate drive with 2 blue mail drop boxes, and a lobby full of post office boxes. You have access 24 hours a day to the PO boxes, which is convenient n nThere's a second lobby behind glass doors, and that's the actually where the post office workers work, and where you would get your counter service for mailing stuff, stamps, etc. The staff here isn't so bad, but its the post office, so don't expect to much. There's a lady that usually waits on me, and she's rather nice. I think there's also a gentleman who works on the counter, and he's a bit more gruff, but gets you what you need. n nBack in 2011, my mailbox was broken, and it took my apartment complex 6 months to fix. Every Saturday morning I came in here to get my mail from the counter staff, and overall, it was okay. Some days were good, other days were not. The later you go in on a Saturday, the longer the line. Your better off getting there first thing to avoid the crowds. Most likely, your going to have some kind of wait. Staff was friendly and decent most of the time, and the wait varied depending on a number of factors. Some Saturdays I was the only one in line, others, the line felt like it was a mile long. 98 of the time, there's only been 2 counter staff working. Its the govt.and the post office did layoffs, so thats most likely why its a line some times. n nOverall, I'm reasonably satisfied with my experiences here. I still use the drop boxes outside often and frequently to mail stuff out, and its great to live close to a place like this. As annoying as the post office is at times, I like being able to save a day on mailing and take my stuff right here.",2
"This place was horrible.first off they sat us in an area that wasn't even being serviced yet. Luckily the waitress serving the area next to us realized we weren't being helped after about 5 min. We even tried getting someones attention but nobody responded, it was pretty obvious no one was waiting on us.its called 'CUSTOMER SERVICE "" I guess they haven't heard of it. The manager that we ""finally "" got to talk to acted like didn't give a crap and obviously she didn't.We will never go to this place again, the one at Red Rock is much better the service was great.",1

We had an appetizer and 4 burgers. Appetizer came out with the burger with no apologies. nAfter we received the food our server disappeared, so condiments and drink refills were ordered from other staff. When she returned she interrupted our conversation to ask if we were done. From this point on she returned to the table with the check not asking about dessert or more drinks every 5 min. to ask if we were done. nFinally, she came by and leaned in to tell us that ""it's getting really busy in here and there are people waiting for a table.

Plan to still wait and then get seated at a community table. n nSecondly, they have too much going on. Most of the year appears to feature a limited menu of one kind or another. If you go there and it's an open menu day, try not to like the food too much, because it may be a year before you can have it again. n nFinally, I've had more crappy service there than I've had good.

Absolutely wretched. We came around noontime on a Sunday and there was only a handful of customers.

When I brought the issue to the attention of an employee I was literally given a slice of toasted bread. I even had to peel the bread apart to fit to the size of my split sandwich since I could not find a plastic knife extremely poor service. They didn't even bother to cut the bread in half for me! n nIt seemed like there was a rather large amount of call in orders since most of the food was going towards take out orders. I waited around 15 minutes for my food. The servers also were not knowledgeable nor attentive about our orders. My friend was asked 3 times whether he wanted the 5 or 8 special when there was only one price listed on their chalkboard. n nI would never come back here again.,1
"The last time I was in this building, it was a steakhouse, and anyone that has been reading for a while knows how I feel about casual steakhouses in general, and perhaps even Texas Land and Cattle specifically. Put another way Taco Mac really had a fairly easy comparison to live up to here. They really didn't make it. n nStarting off, about all they did on the inside was add a bunch of televisions. And when I say a bunch, I mean a bunch. There must be fifty of them. It is good to have somewhere to go to watch the game, but there are so many, you cannot avoid them if you want to and to make matters worse, they added glass at the tops of booths to help with sound from the next table? , so the sets reflect and it looks like there are not fifty, but a hundred sets. It is really distracting. But enough about the sets. n nWe went for lunch, specifically because they had a Coke Freestyle machine. My wife loves them. But Taco Mac has a full service variety. Any of you whipper snappers may not realize that full service means that someone gets it for you. Sorta defeats the fun in the Freestyle you have a hundred or so flavors to play with, but you have to figure out which you want and order it. Go to Firehouse instead, where you can check out the touch screen wizardry for yourself. n nThe good news is that there are plenty of servers presumably so that they can keep those glasses full , and they are friendly enough but they do not listen well. We said we didn't want to know about the all too impressive beer list, and were promptly told all about it. We asked for advice, and were given some suggestions all I can say is that if the suggestions were good, I would hate to have gone with something not suggested. n nAs has been mentioned elsewhere, lunch service is slow. Don't go here if you're in a hurry. Even getting the check and paying it can take a while. Plenty of other options in the area.",1
Yawn. This place used to be amazing. Now over priced like PF Changs. Won't be back.,1
"Being a military spouse, I've been to a lot of eye doctors all over the country and I can't recommend Advanced Eyecare enough. My family has seen Dr. Brian Miller for the last 2 years and not only is he warm and gracious with me but he's also great with my kids. The office staff is polite and I'm always seen on time. I like that I can schedule my kids and myself for our yearly appointments all at the same time and we still get seen in a timely manner.",2
"This update is for the reservations process only. See my other post below for a review of my actual stay. n nMy experience with the Fairmont conference reservations manager almost made me change my mind about wanting to stay here. After speaking to a helpful person at the 1 800 number, I was transferred to the hotel since I was requesting a conference rate. After waiting several minutes for someone to answer, the conference specialist came on the line. Even though this hotel wasn't listed in my conference literature as participating, she assured me that she could offer me a conference rate. Interestingly enough, the rate she quoted me was higher than the rack rate on the website and I told her so. She basically told me I was wrong, but I decided to book a room anyway, knowing that I could always cancel it up to 24 hours before check in. n nA few weeks later, I received a notification from Hotels.com that some hotels in Montreal were having a summer sale. Upon checking the Fairmont's website I discovered that the Queen Elizabeth was included. Daily rates were 20 off with every third night free. I immediately called the 1 800 number again and asked if I could change my reservation to take advantage of the sale. I was told that I couldn't change an existing reservation, so then I said I wanted to book a new reservation and I'd cancel the original one. n nThe reservationist said this was fine and calculated my cost under the new rates. I'd be saving at least 350. The catch was that I'd have to prepay for the room, and changes or cancellations were not allowed. I decided to check a few of the other hotels participating in the sale first before booking. When I did call back to make a reservation, the agent I got wasn't nearly as helpful as the first one. n nI explained that I had an existing reservation but wanted to make an additional one for the discounted rate I'd been quoted, then cancel the original reservation. This reservationist told me I'd have to cancel my first reservation by calling the conference manager at the hotel she couldn't do it for me. I said this was fine. Then she told me that even though I was creating a new reservation, I might be charged the original conference rate anyway. WTF? n nWhen I asked why, she said that if I was attending a conference while in town, an agreement between the conference organizers and the Fairmont might result in my being charged a higher rate regardless. To this, I responded that it sounded like a highly illegal practice to me. And then I asked who exactly would be enforcing this? The Fairmont? And she said no, the conference organizers. Huh? I told her I was booking independently, not through the conference organizers, so how would they know where I was staying and for what rate? She's lucky I didn't just choose another hotel, but I really wanted to stay at the Fairmont. n nIn the end I told her to book my second reservation using the same dates and room type as my original one. All seemed ok. The total she quoted was correct. But when I checked the reservation online later, she'd put me in a smaller room than I'd originally booked. Argh! n nBy the time I noticed this, the sale dates had passed, but I called the 1 800 number anyway. The reservationist I spoke to this time told me he couldn't make any changes to my reservation, as per the sale restrictions. I explained to him that I shouldn't have to be inconvenienced because the reservations agent had a made a mistake. He said he'd have to put me through to the hotel itself to speak to the reservations manager, so I said fine. Again I had to wait several minutes for someone to answer, and when I explained why I'd been transferred, she read me the details of my reservation, which mysteriously had been switched to a king from a queen during the time I'd been on hold. Still, I don't know why I had to waste my time on the phone with the hotel if they'd already corrected their error. n nSo, after such a horrendous experience with the Fairmont's reservations people, I was starting to think I'd made a bad choice in hotels. But once I arrived at the Fairmont in Montreal, I had a 4 star experience. Please see the review of my stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth below. ",1
 2.20 for a pretty flavorless Americano. I'll be drinking the crappy coffee in my room for the rest of the summer thanks.,1
"Fan freakin' tastic. This is one of the few shows in my life I would go see again and again and again. I also think this is the best Cirque show to take a ""manly man "" to see, as he will enjoy the martial arts elements, the stage, and the fact that there is an actual storyline. n nThere truly is not a bad seat in the house. I actually wish I had gotten WORSE seats so that I could have taken in everything from a distance. n nI can't recommend this show enough!",2
This place is great. The guy that helped me Damien I think was super helpful. I am always searching around town for shops that carry E licube Pink Starburst and these guys hooked it up. They also have a ton of different juices from Cali that you don't normally found in Las Vegas. Great Shop.,2
I had the most unpleasant experience I have had in my life time. This place should not advertise that they recycle clothing. On the phone they said bring in anything and we will go thru it. They seemed to be almost afraid of me. It took one woman over 3 hours to go thru my items. The time and results I received did not even pay for gas. Please do not waste your time.,1
"So, they just opened, we went to try it out. We sat in the bar area at this table with a long wooden bench that was not very comfortable. They had four really nice looking booths, but they were already occupied, the rest of the tables were in the bar and were mismatched and didn't look very comfortable. We sat and waited and waited and waited. We saw two servers talk and discuss who was going to take our table and yet no one came over or even acknowledged us with a smile or anything. Another couple came in and sat down and they got menus at least from a less than friendly server. After waiting almost 8 minutes w no acknowledgement, we got up and left. With this kind of service, I don't know why they even bothered opening. There are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to waste our time and money to be ignored. This was a disappointment since we have been looking forward to this place re opening since we live just up the road and we used to go there a lot when it was the Outside Inn ",1
"Unlike the last review I wrote about an unconventional outlet mall, Outlets At Anthem is EXACTLY what you'd think of when you think 'Outlet Mall'. It is one mammoth of a shopping center and it doesn't matter WHO you are you will mos' def.' find something that catches your eye in any one of the multiple stores total understatement located in this complex. n nWhether you're looking for Gap, BCBG, Banana Republic, Book Warehouse, Calvin Klein, Bose, Claire's, Kitchen Collection, Jockey, Polo, Perfumania, Ultra Diamonds, Vans, or Yogurberry JUST TO NAME A FEW , the Outlets At Anthem have got you covered. n nBeing the avid swimmer that I am, I hit up the Nike Factory store and bought two count 'em TWO Nike swimsuits for 60. Usually one runs me about 75. Can I get a holllllllaaaa?!?!?!? n nThe only reason I had to take off a star is because this is an outdoor outlet mall, and in a place like Arizona, that is INSANE. The weather was SO scorching hot that I would have PAID an entry fee to shop at an indoor, AIR CONDITIONED shopping complex. n nAh well, still got the goods at the outlet prices. Can't complain.too much ",2
"My husband and I stopped by for dinner tonight. We ordered an appetizer platter don't remember the name because it was Italian but it was the most expensive appetizer 19 this appetizer alone is the reason I gave them two stars instead of one. I ordered the orechiette with Italian sausage and broccoli rabe. I first noticed that my dish was swimming in olive oil about one inch deep. Forked up some pasta dripping with olive oil, took a bite, tasted like I bit into pure salt.thought maybe it's just salty and not mixed well enough. Mixed tried a broccoli rabe, again salty. I'm the type of person that will try and not complain about my food and I have never sent food back. However the manager at that moment I think he's the manager because he was dressed in a suit and greeting tables stopped by and asked how everything was and I just whispered it's a little salty. THe manager gave me a look I felt very bad and without a word took my plate and went to the kitchen. I was very uncomfortable because I felt terrible but the dish was inedible. A few minutes passed and the manager came and said we'll get you a new dish which was very kind but I was still uncomfortable because I could tell by the look of his face he was upset. Anyways got my dish and noticed now that there was absolutely no salt. But I will say I'd rather have it that way. All in all I ended up taking a couple bites and that's about it. My husband had spaghetti with meatballs and again heavy salt with the meatballs but at least his pasta was fine. As for the appetizer, I guess the reason it was good was because there really wasn't any cooking involved. Basically it was prosciutto, olives, garlic, and another meat of some sort. . I will not go back again because I don't think paying someone 60 to fill me with salt is worth it.",1
"Food was excellent, we had the Rojo Diablo with sweet potato fries and the All Star burger with real fries. Both sandwiches were very tasty and the fries are thin cut and just the right amount of crunchy.",2
"This place used to be great. The hot food was always good and fresh. The cold sandwiches were consistently delicious. Now, it's just a collection of shortcuts. The mac cheese is watery. The Sonoma chicken salad has the most gigantic pieces of chicken, and the strange watery mayo they use just drips out of the tortilla. Ick. I don't know what happened, but quality control has gone downhill. Not a place I'll frequent anymore. Except maybe for the chocolate chip cookies.",1
"The ice cream machine is ALWAYS ""broken "". Or ""you're just lazy and have poor customer service "", sounds about right to me.",1
"I went in for a procedure and had a great time! I was greeted by an extremely nice woman that assisted me with my forms.

The doctor greeted me and explained everything until I understood what I was doing. n nOverall the entire appointment lasted no longer than 20 minutes, and I am extremely happy with my results! I've referred 2 friends already and both are also extremely satisfied. All 3 of us will be back!",2

"These guys are so honest! My husband took our truck to them today, fully expecting to pay for air conditioning service. The service tech asked about the symptoms told my husband there is nothing wrong with the unit! They could have just done the service collected the money but they are too honest to do that! More businesses could be that honest! Highly recommend Fletcher's Tire Auto Service, been doing business with them a long time never disappointed!",2
"You could eat breakfast, lunch and dinner here and explore with every meal. Food is fresh and hot and the salsa bar alone might be worth it. Reasonable prices and quick service. Only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is because those restrooms have got to change up could use more than one stall per restroom so I don't have to wait on the chica putting her makeup on. Looking for a meal you'll have to work off? Try the LARGE nachos naughty, naughty!",2
"After you get your drink the waitress turns into Houdini. Poof, gone, no more service for you. Needless to say I didn't eat here, you can only sit and wait for someone to take your order for so long before you just get up and walk out. Just a tip, don't eat here. ever!",1
"Wish we had gone to the Chandler location, but our Restaurant.com gift was for the Southern location. Avoid the pizza here unless you really like sweet doughy crust. Be prepared for lemon on just about everything. Doesn't take long for everything to taste like lemon. Good roast on the potatoes but, be prepared for a very strong lemon taste. Although there wasn't hardly anyone in our area, the service seem slow. The flaming feta was thin and needed more heat. The general appearance is outdated, run down and needing a remodel. You will enjoy the Chandler location much better than this one.",1
"We ordered online which was convenient, but were disappointed that it took over an hour for the order to arrive. The food was delivered warm and tasty. We especially enjoyed the lemon chicken and vegetable egg roll.",2
"We have had nothing but good luck with them. Quality food, super fast delivery, and everyone is very polite. I was surprised this time that the specials were gone and a delivery fee was added, but the guy on the phone was up front about it.",2
"How big is not big enough? Well, apparently given other reviewers' sentiments Bison Witches' generous sandwiches fall into that category. I guess we now know why America suffers from an obesity epidemic. n nThe portions at Bison Witches are more than ample that is a friendly poke at all you fatties . I had the Sundevil sandwich as part of the half sandwich and soup combo, and it was not small. For most people making sandwiches at home, the half sandwich that I was served would probably be bigger than the whole sandwich that you would make on your own. n nQuantity is one thing, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the food was really good too. Both the sandwich and soup definitely tasted as though they were made from high quality ingredients. The bread tasted as though it was bakery quality, and the sandwich ingredients were definitely a lot better than your typical cold cuts. Plus the server was very attentive which definitely added to the overall experience. The only downside to my meal was that it took an unconscionably long time to get served. I don't fault the server, it was almost as if the kitchen staff was hung over from an intense workweek night of partying and too apathetic to slap together some sandwiches and soup. n nFor those of you who have been to Dilly's, there is no longer a need to go there for your lunchtime sandwich fix. Bison Witches should definitely be at the forefront of your lunch lineup.",2
"I love this place. What a great restaurant nWhen I first moved to Madison I saw the restaurant and I thought ""Psht, Graze? I bet it's some pretentious vegan restaurant, I don't see me going there anytime soon "" I know I'm a moron nI WAS SO WRONG! This place is wonderful! and if you're like me, there are LOTS of meat options on the menu and vegetarian options of course nIt's got a great menu and drink list and I've been back many many times since my first experience they serve a fabulous brunch . Some of my favorite things to get there is the cheese platter just tell your server what kinds of cheese you like and they will make some recommendations , the oysters on the half shell because that is always a great option, and their carrot cake I cannot believe it's vegan and Gluten free. I usually don't bother with restrictive diet options like that, but it is SO GOOD nTheir menu is always changing so I will make sure to come back sometime in the winter to see the surprises they have in store for me next. nHighly recommended, one of my favorite restaurants in Madison",2
"Took my 5 month old puppy in for her first groom here today and I am beyond impressed! I was a little worried she might be nervous but she fell in love with her sweet groomer, Robin, right away. My dog is a miniature schnauzer so the cut is a little tricky and I was worried they might go to short or too long on the legs. Also, we didn't want the traditional schnauzer face so I was worried about that too. When I picked her up she looked PERFECT! They really did a great job listening to what we wanted and making it so! She was sent home with a cute pink bandana, a little bag of treats with a big bow, and, best of all, a ""my first groom "" certificate complete with her photo and gold stars for good behavior. Beyond impressed, will be going back and asking for Robin!",2
Love Lunch Express! They are always timely on their delivery and ordering is very easy over the phone. The food is always delicious!,2
Why only one person working every time. Avoid this place unless you have at least 30 minutes to spare,1
"NOTHING fast about this food. nLast time I came here I missed a flight. nThis time, I wasnt in a hurry, but it still took forever. Everyone in line was visibly disgusted. nThe employees are polite but they move like they have lead in their feet.",1
"Grand Cafe made for a very nice place to wait for a movie at Sunset Station. Service is pleasant and efficient, and the portion sizes are a little more than expected without being excessive. The shrimp cocktail may seem pricey until they set it down on the table and you see they packed it with shrimp. Want a steak? I didn't need a steak knife, I only needed my fork as it was cooked exactly the way I requested it. Their menu offers something for everyone so if you're with a group of people who can't make up their mind on what they want, Grand Cafe can help with that. n nOverall I was very pleased with Grand Cafe and will be going back again.",2
"Complete waste of time. I walked in to make an appointment, the guy working said ""Come back in an hour "" I came back an hour later to a different person who had no appointment scheduled for me. They offered to have me wait about 30 mins for the barbers to finish with their clients and I did. The two barbers spent a good part of that half hour arguing about who was going to cut my hair because neither of them wanted to do it and then when they were finished with their clients they both left the larger car and went to hang out in the caboose. I have heard that Bolt Barbers are known for barbers with attitude, but these guys were just plain unprofessional clowns. The barbers were super ghetto and reminisced about their friends that had been murdered and talked about giving women free haircuts for sexual favors, in front of two children that were about 5 and 8. I would never recommend this place to anyone and only give it one star because I cannot give negative stars. This was my first time there and seeing as how I had to wait more than 2 hours and still didn't get a cut I will never go back. Avoid this place like it has AIDS",1
"Ordered take out delivery for lunch and was less than satisfied. Salads with ""mixed greens "" came with nothing more than a pile of dry iceberg lettuce. The veggies on top weren't great quality either. On top of that, the chicken was missing on top. although they did send over a new salad with chicken, I'll give them credit for that . If they can't build a simple salad according to their own menu description then I'm not about to try them again.",1
Good pizza but horrible service. Very rude on the phone when asking questions about their specials. Will call another pizza place that can take the time to talk to me. Will not order from here again.,1
Not too shabby. A nice getaway from the flashy lights of the Vegas Strip. They had an ok selection of drafts I drank Bass and it was a place I could actually hold a conversation with my friends without talking loudly like most bars we had been to all week. Thank goodness there are low key places to hang out at in Vegas! haha,2
I heard great things about this place and opted to go last night on date night with my wife. We made reservations through opentable.com and showed up.only to find it was CLOSED on a Thursday night! WT. I really wish someone would communicate that. Fail!,1
Food is excellent. Facility is uncomfortably small with limited seating and the place needs better AC. The best sauces served anywhere.,2
What happened to US Airways? I used to fly with these guys all the time a few years back and it was fine but now it is completely ridiculous. We arrived at the airport with plenty of time or so we thought but due to the enormous lines that only plagued us airways customers we ended up boarding our flight just before the doors closed. Now I am sitting at the tarmac in PHX with barely enough time to.make my connecting flights and they are giving us no info or assurance that we will make it. Add this airline to my no fly list along with spirit.,1

Check out this little wine shop in the burbs and feel the love. The owner lives and breathes his business and you will know it immediately. Brad and I go out a lot and we are still in awe of this experience. This is how all businesses should be run. n nLooking forward to going back ,2

"We came here after a short night of experiencing Montreal nightlife after nearly every single bar was either at capacity or extremely shady looking. Our cabbie even judged us as losers for heading out for Poutine at 1 30am. Shucks. n nAfter a quick 10 min wait, we were seated and placed an order for the T Rex poutine and a couple of beers. The poutine came with sausage, hot dog, bacon, cheese curd, and a gallon of gravy dumped atop french fries. The sad part is that these could have been the worst fries in the world and you wouldn't be able to tell from all that gunk atop of it. I wasn't very impressed.but maybe a few more drinks in me woulda made all the difference! n nP.S. They have a weird system where you pay after you order, before you receive your dish.

A very disappointing stay all in all. The upsides? Good breakfast.",1
"Centrally located, upper scale hotel. Best features of the hotel are the friendly staff, great location and fantastic food and service at Bar Le Senateur. This has become my usual place to stay when visiting Montreal. nRooms are clean, a decent size with all the amenities you need but certainly nothing special other than the view. I would classify the physical appearance and amenities as average in the Marriott chain. nThe front desk staff are very pleasant, accommodating and efficient. Bar Le Senateur is a perfect place to watch a game while having dinner and a beverage. The bartender name escapes me is excellent. Very friendly!",2
"I've probably been to Monta Ramen about 20 times now, and in my opinion it's the best ramen noodle shop in town Fukumimi does come close in my opinion.more on that in another review. n nThe Food 5 out of 5 nI usually order either the Tonkotsu Shoyu or the Miso Ramen and then add an egg. I absolutely love their broth I am a big fan of salt after all . At times, we will order gyoza and or fried rice to go along with our orders of ramen, and that is usually a good way to round out the meal. n nThe Service 4 out of 5 nI love how fast the turnover of tables is after a patron as left because there is usually a line of people waiting to get in. This is my only true gripe about Monta I just wish that they had just a little more seating room. HINT If you go here for lunch, they open at 11 30am.just make sure that you are a couple of minutes early otherwise you will be waiting about 20 30 mins to get seated. n nThe Price 5 out of 5 nOk, I guess that this could be better if it were FREE, but come on, that's not going to happen! But, you shouldn't be paying any more than 20 pp here more like 10 12 pp if you're not getting any extras and or having water as your drink . n nOVERALL nMonta Ramen is at the top of the pack for Japanese ramen noodle shops in Las Vegas in my opinion!",2

"I purchased a car a year ago with Carmax and it has been nothing but a problem, a problem they cannot fix I should say.

I have spent so much money on rental car fees just so they cannot fix the problem. Also when I got it back this last time they had put over 300 miles on my car, for what, not like the problem got fixed. There were items left in my car like someone had used it to move. Also a beer bottle cap and receipt for lunch. So obviously they are letting their mechanics use customers cars for personal reasons. If it was not a warranty item I would be taking to a real mechanic! n nThey are the worst! I would never buy from them ever again. Sad thing is I have recommeded them to so many people and always talked so highly of them. n nOh I failed to mention that my car was in an accident in 2008 and they never told me when I purchased the car, I found it myself on the jeep site since jeep had done the repairs.

Went to Poppys tonight with a friend. Had Marilyn as our waitress and she was awful. Didn't smile or hardly talk to us. She was so slow and hardly checked on us.

Extremely non friendly and I would never want her as my waitress again. She is the women with the lip work done. Hope the manager of this place sees this and trains her better.

The bathroom door didn't close, the shower didn't work, there were chew marks on the sheets, there was a mouse in the room, tons of stains on everything, and our keys stopped working and when we went to go get new ones, the front desk was closed. WHAT FRONT DESK CLOSES MID DAY?!? The beds felt horrible, the pillows were little squares and smelt like vomit. Just overall, this place sucks. I recommend finding some place that's actually nice. As my friends said, they should call this place you'll never spend more than two Days Inn",1
"I'm updating my review to reflect my last two experiences here at Another Broken Egg Caf u00e9. Both visits were on Sunday mornings around 10 AM which, arguably, is probably their weekly peak. However, on both occasions, our wait times were extraordinary despite seeing many unoccupied tables from the lobby. n nOn our latest visit, my wife and seven year old daughter and I were seated with three adult menus we had to ask two different staff for a kids menu. It then took about 30 minutes to receive our food from the time we ordered it and, when our orders arrived, they were all cool as if they had been sitting for a while. By that time we were so hungry we did not complain. n nOn the earlier of the two visits, our service was so slow that the manager offered to comp our meal. We did not take her up on the offer because we figured it was a fluke and she was trying her best to manage the situation. n nAre there factors such as variety and quality that justify dining in a place despite subpar service? Sometimes yes. However, my wife and I agree that there are other nearby options that deliver an overall richer breakfast experience than Another Broken Egg Caf u00e9. We do hope that they are able to address their service and quality issues as their menu is unique in our area.",1
"Clean room is where it ends. Linens were torn, towels were like sand paper. We were grateful to be upgraded, but the hotel positively reeks of smoke, non smoking rooms included. We walked through all the properties on the strip and despite a recent upgrade remodel, unfortunately TI is the WORST! They try in vain with coconut air freshener pumped through every possible opening to overcome it, but instead give the guests coconut ashtray scent. Buffet is free for a reason, and that is the only reason you should go. Never pay for this breakfast or lunch. Better off at McDonalds for sure. Staff is friendly and helpful throughout the property. Pirate show is long gone. We wouldn't stay there again for free. Now. If you are a smoker, I bet it's just fine and an excellent value.",1
"As I walked in the front door there was a sign posted ""Help Wanted "". I should have known . I was just looking anyway and didn't intend to buy anything today. However, I found a range hood and purchased it. What I have to say is that if you go there and PETE is your 'customer service advocate' . RUN . don't walk . RUN ! He has NO business working in customer service. Even while I was waiting a long period of time to be helped, he casually walked over to some other desk, picked up his drink from Circle K and takes a drink . then meanders back and I'm still waiting. He has one speed REVERSE. I won't be back to this store. The only person in this store wtih a clue at all was Noah who had GENUINE desire to help, but wasn't able to as he's never been trained on the cash registers. There was some other guy name Tim that seemed to know what he was doing . but again, if you get Pete . RUN !",1
"Totally mediocre at best. we have tried it twice and its dry and laking in flavor. Maybe if your order the vegan option, its ok but if you want big, bold flavor.Try elsewhere. In a pizza town like this, we won't go back.",1
"The food here is amazing. I have now sampled several items from their menu, and nothing has disappointed at all. I love the fact that they have PBR on their beer menu for 2. It makes paying for the food a lot easier on a tighter budget. Anyhow, even though the food, the room, the atmosphere are all 5 star, service still really needs to step up its game. For the quality offered, and the justified price point, the quality of service still needs improvement. Now, not by any means is the service atrocious, it's actually pretty decent. I just expect a bit more when I'm paying this much. Whether it's spaciness or inattentiveness, it just takes away from what can and should be 5 stars all around. Nevertheless, I will be back soon!",2
Old owners are back so I thought I would try it again. Same lousy food. I picked up the food to go and it was already cold. The tacos had so much grease dripping from them I collected it to change my car oil. SO needles to say I am done with them!,1
"I used to go to Jalapenos many years ago before they had a fire. My friend and I checked it out tonight and were pleasantly surprised. The layout is completely different, the menu is much more extensive and expensive OK though . Our waitress JJ was right on the ball with drinks and our food order. I had the shrimp tacos and they were quite good. My friend had the seafood enchilada and said it was very good also. We have one complaint though, and it's a big one for us. This was something we didn't notice until after we ordered and the food arrived. The people behind us had a dog in the restaurant and it wasn't a service dog. The dog was medium sized and in some kind of nylon carrier with screened sides, and an open unzipped top. When we mentioned to our waitress that it's against the law she said ""Oh, it's OK it's in a carrier "". That did it for us, we will never go back there again. Instead of 3 or 4 stars we give it a one because of the dog.",1
Monkey recently required one of his AC units to be replaced. His home warranty company contracts with Around the Clock to repair home appliances. A technician came out and evaluated the AC. The technician returned the evaluation to Around the Clock but it has taken them over 4 days to submit the claim despite the temperatures over 100 degrees and Monkey having his small baby in the house. Monkey identified this fact to the Manager multiple times over the past few days but to no avail. It seems the Manager just doesn't care. Additionally Monkey has a technician come out to evaluate the water heater who seemed quite unusual and made Monkey's wife uncomfortable.,1
"This restaurant was pretty disappointing. Our waiter pretty much checked out when he realized that we didn't want to order his expensive wine suggestion and we got the cheapest bottle on the menu instead. n nI got the fettuccine with mushrooms and it was about 26. It wasn't bad, but I've had better pasta at Applebee's for 1 3 of the price. My friend got the cheese ravioli, still 19. The sauce reminded me of chef boyardee tomato sauce and the cheese was almost non existent. n nBottom line, it's really expensive for the quality of food and service.",1
"Goldfingers has become my ""go to "" place for breakfast. The kitchen does an excellent job turning out a great menu full of traditional favorites with a few surprises. The Pancake Sandwich is a can't miss, and their daily specials are all delicious.",2
"I tried to book a ride from the hotel to the airport. the odd thing is that they don't want to write down your name much less your phone number. I asked them if I could provide that info and the person on the phone said ""no "". Given the bad reviews, I was wary that there would be a problem with the driver finding me how do you find someone among the sea of people in front of a big hotel? and then I would risk missing my flight. I then went with Super Shuttle and they did take down my name and contact number. n nJust wanted to put the word out there in case other people would find it helpful to know ahead of time, instead of going through the trouble of booking through this company. nI might still use Airline Shuttle Corp from the airport to the hotel, since then there's no risk of missing a flight and I have ample time.",1
WARNING! Butcher shop. They can't even inject properly. They gave me a hematoma from a simple procedure. Avoid these butchers. Chop shop alert. You have been warned. New dentists practicing without supervision. Zero stars.,1
"I don't know how much worse this place can be. I tried the Happy Valley location with an awful experience a year ago and decided to give Mellow Mushroom another chance when they had a Groupon. Bad idea. n nThe first incident of this meal was getting a dirty water glass. This wasn't just 'dirty,' it was caked with food on the bottom. I didn't notice for a second. there was FOOD FLOATING IN MY WATER. and when I took a closer look, the bottom of the glass had dough or some sort of sauce sitting there looking back at me. Our server didn't seem surprised and didn't apologize. I guess this happens all the time? I asked for my water in a to go cup. n nWe waited over 30min on a Wednesday evening to get our small pizza and sandwich with less than half the restaurant full. Our waiter was nowhere to be found for water refills. n nI ordered a small mega veggie pizza and my boyfriend ordered their steak and cheese hoagie. This was probably the WORST veggie pizza I've ever had. There's something off about the dough and it's greasy as hell. I had more cheese on my pizza than veggies and the taste of the veggies was weird like one of the vegetable toppings was starting to go bad . And tofu on this pizza? It's overkill and it's not doing anyone any favors and I'm sure it's GMO soy. nHis hoagie was okay, summing up his sandwich as ""giving me more than I need doesn't make it better. "" This sandwich was overflowing with meat. n nI ate less than one slice and decided to box up the rest. As we were walking out, I dumped my leftovers. I've never EVER thrown away almost a whole pizza. Seriously how can you get it so wrong? n nBad food. Dirty glasses. Apathetic service. The only redeeming quality? Their beer draft selection.",1
"pretty place. not sure if we got the ""b "" squad or what. n nwedding day most important day in two peoples lives ususally n nNoah's was seriously understaffed and seriously u prepared. n nDONT TRUST THEM TO HANDLE SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS YOUR WEDDING! n n1. they RAN OUT OF ICE. not after several hours of partying, it was actually before the bridal party had even entered the party. DId they send out the manager or a bussboy to grab some ice asap? no, they sent father of the bride. n n2. 2 urinals and two toilets in a mens room, shared among the 200 guests at our wedding AAAAND the sweet 16 party going on in another room. I expect to wait in line for 10 minutes at a football game to piss, not at place dedicated to throwing such parties. n n3. Service was severely lacking. One of the servers came over to the bridal party minutes after we FINALLY got to sit down with a cocktail and told us "" were gonna have some fun! The groomsmen are gonna help us hand out champagne glasses for the toast! I told her no, because I am a dick, several of the other groomsmen got up and begrudgingly helped. Not off a tray mind you, they were passing out champagne glasses from a giant leftover box from costco that once help kirkland signature cranberry juice in it. Classy. n n4. the food that was supposed to be served on arrival 415 isn was served at 530. once I took a bite, i realized that the food had been DONE since 415, but they just werent ready to serve it till much later. I have no idea how to make roast beef soaking in its own juices THIS DRY, but it was horrible. I got another serving of potatoes and choked them down since I hadnt eaten since breakfast. n n5. cleanliness and attention to detail. I took a pic of the windows at the entrance, it looked like someone had sprayed champagne or sprite all over them at a previous event. THIS IS THE F ING ENTRNCE, at least take the time to wipe down the glass and the door handles! n nif you still are dying to have your wedding there, if you still dont believe me, get a contract that outlines a financial loss to Noah's when they fuck up extremely important details like .I dont know. ICE.",1
"Not good. Id pay 16 to NOT eat here again. We were stared down by the chef while getting food? The place was hot and muggy and smelled like a fart. There was a glass barrier above the ice cream that forces you to lean over the first row of ice cream to get to the second, making you breathe all over the ice cream! GROSS. nThe server and hostess were somewhat nice though.",1
"By far the best of the ""meat houses "". Pretty pricey, but great service. Also, the sides and salads beat the heck out of the other Brazilian places.",2
"Big Wong is BIG on value. Though we missed the ""Dollar Dining, "" we are very happy to have discovered this place. Luckily, my parents saved the flyer and after seeing the prices on their menu, we asked, ""why not? "" We went there this past Sunday evening and met the owners Wai or was it Wayne? and Connie and their ""regulars "" Judd and Lynn. Luck would have it, we are all avid cruisers. Woo Hoo.one can never have too few cruising buddies! n nBack to why we are here the food. Big Wong's menu is limited to one page and some posted specials on the wall. After discussing the menu with Wai and Connie, their philosophy is to keep the menu simple and ensure their food is always consistent and at a reasonable price. Mission accomplished! n nI had the Hainan Chicken and my wife had the Curry Chicken. The flavoring of the Hainan style chicken was delicate and tender. You dip the chicken into the accompanying chili sauce or soy sesame oil sauce. The included seasoned rice was fluffy and also delicately seasoned. The chicken curry was wonderful and included potatoes, however, I like a little more ""kick "" in my curry. Spiciness is such a subjective matter and I understand you cannot please everyone. Some people may just complain that it is too spicy. You can't subtract spiciness, but you can always add. Connie also brought a sample of their beef stew and let me tell you, the beef was so tender and delicious! Both of our portions are satisfying and don't let the price fool you. You definitely get your money's worth here! n nLooking forward to becoming regulars at Big Wong and try out their ramen and wontons. n nUpdate 6 5 11 Since writing this review, we have been back two more times and today with my parents. I have had the Beef Ramen, Ribeye over Pasta, and my wife had the Shrimp Wontons twice. Big Wong's Beef Ramen is exquisite. They spend a lot of time preparing the bite size chunks of beef and tendons by trimming out the fat and un chewable membrane that you find in Chinese style beef stew. Every piece is satisfyingly tender. I asked Wai how is the broth prepared and he told me directly from the stew. Delicious and hearty. No MSG after taste here. n nThe wontons immersed in a flavorful broth are loaded with shrimp and no pork filler used here. The ribeye is also very tender and juicy cooked medium and comes with a pepper style gravy that you pour yourself and a sliced herbed potato. n n6 17 11 Went to our first UYE here at Big Wongs. It was great to meet other Yelpers. n n6 19 11 Wai has been telling me about his Dungeness Crab over rice noodles horfun special and I had to give it a try so we came back today. The fresh crab is steamed with ginger and served over the rice noodles with it's natural sweet crab juice. Simply delicious.",2
"I can't recommend this place highly enough! They serve some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted. It was amazing when it was a lunch spot, and is even more unique and delicious now that it's dinner only. Friendly and helpful staff and small plates so you can try what you'd like. But you really can't go wrong with anything. It's all spectacular!",2
"Worst restaurant I've ever been in! Came in on a hot afternoon, the place has no AC. The whole restaurants looks old and dirty. The food taste mediocre. The thai tea I ordered was sour! On top of that, the grilled pork i ordered had a small roach that crawled out. The owner never once apologize or offer a refund. I will never come back again. Stay far and far away of this place!",1
"This is another Caesars Entertainment property that is centrally located on the Strip. The hotel is huge, so expect to do some walking and exploring. There are multiple towers to the hotel some are closer to the casino, some to the pool, and some are closer to the meeting rooms, nThis can help if you are staying for business, pleasure, or both. The Palace Tower elevators have direct access to the meeting halls and pools, whereas the newer Octavius and Augustus Towers are near the pools but is farthest from the meeting halls. The Forum Tower is closest to the Colusseum but has no direct access to the pool or meeting halls without having to go through the casino. nAll that aside, the rooms are excellent. Comfortable beds and some of the best pillows I've put my head on. The showers are awesome one of the things that I really think makes a hotel stand out since most rooms have these dual head showers over head rainfall and wide spray front showers . And the TV in the bathroom. nThere are plenty of food options, including room service. I will say this, if you are a foodie or just want to eat a lot, make sure to visit the Bacchnal Buffet. it is rated 1 by USA Today for a reason. The food is great, you have hundreds of selections from different cuisines, just be sure to wait at times since the line to go in may be up to an hour or more to get seated, unless you have a Diamond or Seven Stars players card. As a local, I feel its a little overrated, but its a must try just to say you did it. nParking can be an issue, especially on the longer weekends during the summer or if there is a fight in town. The self parking may fill up and can be hard to find parking. At times, even valet parking will become full and only Diamond or Seven Star cardholders may use the Valet. nMy recommendations for dining also includes the Gordon Ramsay Pub. I have a separate review for their restaurants.",2
"I was here randomly with my step uncle one day. It's a low key place with some interesting folks. Mostly of the 40 age group. Drinks are cheap. As far as I know, most people come here for the off track betting. Although, I also heard the pizza is good.",1
"I come here out of convenience, since Jamba Juice is a bit of a drive. n nI find their smoothies to just be ""OK "". They do the job, but its definitely not top quality in my opinion. Their smoothies are so ""ice y "" where every sip I take, I feel like I'm chewing on ice bits. There are people who like that, though, but not me. I also find some of the smoothies are watered down, and not very flavorful. n nI prefer Jamba Juice, where the smoothies are smooth, thick, creamy and delicious.",1
"Whoever says that this place is better than the SGV dim sum restaurants must be trully stupid or get their head bang in the shower. This place is horrendous. If you see the color of the chicken feet you know that its not going to taste good. The rest of the food seems cooked too long and the service is slow. n nI mean, I understand when you go to chinese restaurant you expect the service to suck ass cos thats the way they operate, but when you have the owner operating as cashier that tell the customer to pay upfront then you should just open a to go counter instead of a full dining restaurant. n nIf you dont know how to open a full seating restaurant, go slow, open a little to go place first!",1

"i had had the burger salad.it was good. I usually think protein burgers leave something to be desired, but this one was just right! fries were great! mint chocolate chip shake was amazing! Just a bit too expensive! 2 burgers, one grilled cheese, one soda and one shake for about 45! hence the 4 points.",2
I got the Four Peaks burger with fries and the beer sampler. Their beers are great! Its so nice to have a place like that in Phoenix. And I was able to watch the UC Bearcats bowl game while eating with my family.,2
"Boo! Not a fan. I was quoted a 2 hr wait to have an easy tire patch and then told I couldn't leave the building. I asked them to call when they started working on my car so I could be back in 5 minutes, but they absolutely refused. I'm not excited about the level of service or friendliness. Plus, I'm hungry and I won't be able eat for hours. Not that I expect the employees here to bring me a turkey sandwich, but they could at least be nice about it. Better yet, just text me when my car is ready so I'm not stuck here for hours with nothing but an auto racing magazine. Customer service fail.",1

"I first ate at Graze Desert Grille last year when this North Scottsdale resort was called Xona it's now Zona . I believe this grille had a different name then, too. I stayed at this resort facility while in town looking for an apartment. n nLast year I had breakfast a couple of times, and I remember that it was really good. You can choose items, including healthy care, from the menu or you can take advantage of the breakfast buffet. Fast forward to now, when I live here and saw a post on Facebook about their brunch. I decided to drive up there after church last Sunday and have lunch. The place was quiet and I took a spot at the bar, where I was well taken care of. I had the Chicken Sonoran sandwich with avocado slices and their sweet potato fries with ranch. Yum! n nThe service was great, and I was kinda glad there weren't many people in there.I was looking for some peace and quiet. The only thing I would change is to add more items to the menu. n nTips n Drive in via Zona's main entrance and park in the parking lot there in front of the main doors, as if you were parking to check in . As you're walking towards the main entrance, bear left and Graze is there by the patio. n The patio has misters!",2
"This place looks amazing when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's diner. Then the longer you spend there the less amazing it became. The service is terrible and it took forever to get our food. I made my own burger but found the burger meat has no seasoning at all, just meat made into a patty and cooked. The fries were not bad but the mac and cheese was not good at all, one bite was enough for me. The dessert looked good but i am sure it was like most of the stuff in this place. Looks great but leaves a bad taste in your mouth.",1
THAT NIGHT IS STILL RINGING IN MY EARS one of the best experiences ive had going out had a great time even though it was crowded because of Halloween and ATB it was very fun and high energy all night the facility itself was very nice good sized dance floors and spas and pools galore cant say enough what a good night it was ,2

"I'm not exactly how I started going to Sweet Daddy Cupcakes, but I haven't looked back since first stepping foot into their shop. Their cupcakes are absolutely phenomenal! To me, it's all about the frosting and I could literally eat a tub of their frosting. it's not the thick, butter based frosting that makes you feel like you're churning butter in your mouth it's creamy and finger licking good. Then the cupcakes themselves are so moist, and flavorful. The cupcake flavors are well thought out and they always rotate different flavors so you are able to try something new when you stop in. Hands down, Sweet Daddy's definitely has the best cupcakes in town, from their cupcake flavors, to the frosting and glitter on top. I literally drive 30 45 minutes to get a Sweet Daddy cupcake or a dozen anytime I need a sugar fix. So worth it!",2
"I would admit that this is probably the only Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh that offers a more traditional, non Americanized Japanese cuisine. However, for their price 15 20 , the quality is sub par at best. n nI believe they are most known for their sushi, oft used in japanese society meetings which i found them fine. Their fried items tonkatsu, tempura seemed too oily likely a result of reusing the same oil, the rice too dry kiss of death for me for any japanese eatery and the miso shiru too salty. For a price around 20 . It is unacceptable. n nIn Japan, Chaya quality would be par with cafeteria food. Would you seem justified in paying 20 ? Unless you are dying for sushi, I would recommend going to Kiku for a similar price range may be slightly more expensive .",1

If you want to go to a Sports Bar and be ignored and treated poorly then this is the bar for you. nWent there to watch the second game of the world series. We were seated right away. We go the happy hour special. All you can drink from 3 6pm for 20.Waitress brought us over our first 12oz draft in a plastic cup and left. 15 minutes later she came back and threw 2 wrist bands on the table and said that we needed to wear them for happy hour. This was the last we saw of her. The place was not busy at all. We saw her and 4 other waitresses stand up at the frt of the bar I had to go to the bartender and get more beers. The bartender was going to charge me for the beers because she said I should have ordered them thru our waitress. I told her I would have but she never came back to the table. We got one more beer and left this place. DO NOT GO HERE! There are MANY other sports bars in Vegas. Go there!,1
"We got free tickets to this show due to booking a room at NYNY and I'm glad we didn't pay. This was the first Cirque show I've been to and I'm assuming the others would have been a better choice. n nThey have a lot of crowd interaction and so if you're sitting on the main floor especially the front row , get ready to participate. The crowd members who were brought up on the stage did a very good job and were willing to play along with what they were asked to do. Some was a little awkward but being a viewer and not a participant, we found it quite entertaining. n nActs featured a lot of female nudity and a couple of fully dressed men. Basically you see a lot of boobs. A lot. Really not what I was expecting or looking to see. A ballerina without her top on? Probably not what her parents imagined. n nOverall, I wasn't wow'd and wouldn't go again. The gift shop features some fun gifts that range from Cirque souvenirs to sex shop treats. We didn't find that the shop was open unless a show had just ended though.",1
So our server was awesome. Told us the straight story won't mention the name . Sucks to order tacos. They come three to a plate and you must get all three the same. Asked for the manager.states that they can't do it any other way because it would back up the kitchen. WHAT? Need new kitchen staff. You can get three different tacos if you order the taco flight however you get 15 tacos! That's great here with your baseball team! Lol what a joke. Server told us if you get the right manager you can get what you want. Where is the consistency? Not impressed. n nFood was 2 stars at best.Over salted.,1
Same as a few other reviews on here. I love their sandwiches but they are ridiculous about the delivery area. He told me it stopped a half mile from my house and refused to deliver to me. Take my money damn it! I want a bootlegger!,1
"As one of my favorite places in Phoenix to see a concert or otherwise I wish I could write the perfect review for Crescent Ballroom. Alas, that is impossible because words don't really do it justice, but I'll still give it an attempt. n nI have seen so many amazing shows at crescent and a lot of credit for these memorable experiences goes to the venue itself. There's not a bad seat in the house in the actual concert area. There's bleacher seating in the back if you're looking to chill and plenty of standing room if you're looking to dance like a maniac, spin around in circles, and jump till you drop. n nWhenever somebody tells me that they haven't been to CB I immediately start gushing to them about the many great qualities about this place music, people, food, atmosphere, ticketing, etc and there are really very few places that I actively promote like I promote Crescent Ballroom. n nAt the end of the day, if you like music and or cool bars and live anywhere in the Valley of the Sun, you have to give this place a try. Also, BEAN DIP!",2
"After walking through the crush of people in the MGM Grand, you arrive at Crush, a relatively small restaurant located off the casino floor of the hotel resort. What a lovely, peaceful space it is. You are presented with the opportunity to try many dishes, thanks to the tapas style menu. But there is nothing Spanish about the menu it is ""anything goes "" like so much of Vegas. The Hamachi plate is especially good. The veal bolognese is just the right amount of filling. The hazelnut dessert seems large enough to share, until you taste it and then you don't want to share it with anybody! The wine list is cushioned with surprises and a solid foundation of wines. nThe bar itself is a busy space, not quite comfortable seating at the bar itself, but the back room, with its curved, brick ceiling makes up for all that. Our server was knowledgeable and courteous.",2
"So this was my first time eating here and the girls at work ordered us food from there. We only ordered 4 lunch specials. Well they told us 30 to 45 minutes. We ordered our food at 11AM and our food got here around 12 40PM. When we called to see what was taking so long, the phone would just ring and ring and ring and ring and ring and NO ANSWER! At first I thought they scammed us because we couldn't get a hold of anyone. When the food finally got here, my appetite was hanging by a thin hair. So the food was kind of cold and mushy. The white rice was overcooked and the orange chicken was too bready. I won't be eating there again. They need to hire some more help and stop being cheap.",1
"I don't love Elvis nor do I hate him, so I came into this with an open mind. I like music and I always enjoy a free concert. Unfortunately, I left this show feeling empty. Be weary of Big Elvis. n n nPros n n Great voice. Big Elvis belts out the best tunes in perfect pitch n The show is in Bill's which is one of the best casinos on the strip n It's free! Drinks and merch are available for purchase n n nCons n n The crowd has an average age of 65 n Big Elvis doesn't stand up. He sits in front of the stage. No, not on the stage. In front of it. Why this happens, I have no idea. What I do know is that it makes him impossible to see if you're 20 or more feet away from the stage n The music and noise from the casino, street, etc is distracting and will drown out Big Elvis if you're not close to the stage n The opening act Kenny Rogers lookalike sings a few songs to kick things off, only to come back near the end of the show to sing a few more. No one is impressed n Big Elvis dips into the king's gospel catalog quite a bit. If you're not a fan of his slower tunes, you may fall asleep n n nI know, I know, haters gonna hate. As a big fan of kitschy Vegas, it was hard not to get behind this strange act. However, Big Elvis is simply missing the zing that makes Vegas entertainment so special.",1
"I was actually really looking forward to getting my hair done. What girl doesn't? Well, the girl started with my highlights, and it took a really long time which I expected from a hair school, afterall they are learning! Then the haircut. n nI chose a Toni and Guy hair style thinking that I was doing my girl a favor. It was a hair style that I thought would be simple since it was one of their styles that they teach. She began to cut and was complaining that her scissors were ""bending "" my hair. They were dull and she kept having to re cut and re cut to make it even. A teacher walked by and she told her what was happening. The response she got was that the ""sharpening person came through yesterday, so too bad "". My cut took so long, that the school was about to close. They asked me to go and pay before she had even begun to finish. I did. Students had just finished their last class in the other room and stood around staring at my hair and not in a good way, I'm assuming because they wanted to close. I ended up with a mullet style when I had asked for a bob. The hair cut was supposed to lay about a inch and a half below my chin and the front of my hair was about two inches above my chin. I had a long layer in the back and I was mortified! nI would have said something, but I felt that my hair was beyond even fixing without chopping it all off! Plus, they were all wanting to leave and ""waiting "" for us to finish and the girl behind the counter had done all of her paper work. What was I supposed to do? I thanked her and even tipped her for her time, went to my car and cried. n nThis was the first time I ever cried from a haircut. It's hair and it will grow back, but this just plain sucked! Sorry Toni and Guy, never again.",1

"Before I start the review, I wanted to address the biggest complaint I read here The size of the gallery and the number of artworks here. This in itself raises an interesting question. What is the ""value "" and ""worth "" of admission of an art exhibit to a person? Do 3 paintings justify the price? 30 paintings? Do the artists showcased play a factor? n nGranted, I took advantage of a ""Free Admission "" day, so I didn't pay the requisite 15 dollars. It's only 4 rooms, so it took less than an hour to complete, but I did see some beautiful pieces there from the ""Figuratively Speaking A Survey of the Human Form "" exhibit. Some from Lichtenstein, and Nara, and Picasso, Degas, and Renoir. Certainly, viewing the works of these artists has to be worth something. n nAnd it's not like the gallery doesn't change its exhibit at least twice a year. The staff was friendly enough and didn't follow you room to room an issue that I had at another now closed museum here. There are locals and student discounts. It comes with a free audio tour. n nSo what is the price of viewing art worth to you? If you like the artists and get a chance to see their works in person, shouldn't that be at least worth some value to yourself? I've been to bigger and admittedly better museums, but I did enjoy my time here. n nWhen the exhibits change, I'd be glad to come back. And yes, I'd actually be fine in paying to do so.",2
"View of Bellagio water show is outstanding. Food was delicious! I may or may not have had their amazing banana souffl u00e9. Yes, I did and would do again! The service was efficient. I dined alone and had made a 515 pm reservation to ensure a window seat. The efficiency is the reason for four vs five starts the waiterade me feel it was more of a production than an experience. A bit more personalization would have got me to give five stars. It was def worth the money and time to eat here!",2

"Macayo's oh Macayo's, how I do love you so so MUCH. I have been going to Macayo's for over 15 years of my life. When I moved away it was the very first place I requested to go when I got off the plane. My grandma knew almost all the staff, which were extremely friendly by the way! n nMy favorite thing to get here is the bowl of albondigas soup and a large TCT drool . I have tried other things of course such as the yummy cheesy enchiladas, the big tasty chimichangas, and rolled tacos. n nI have never experienced bad soup, chiladas, or TCT and I'd say I have been well over 200 times so that's a pretty good record. I must say though, hence why I had to minus a star, there have been a handful of times when I have gotten chicken items to find it was over cooked and flaky. I would have to say it's hit or miss but the other three items you just cannot go wrong. n nHawg dawg, now I need to go get some! D",2
"Sundays have now become, my official Yelp day. I'm going to drive around my area and check out some spots I pass everyday so I have more options to blog about. Today, a last chance decision brought me to this place, as I go to Albertson's right around the corner. n nWalking into this place, let me just say that it seemed promising. The place is quaint, clean and the ""Hawaiian hang loose type "" decor reminds me of home. ""Why is it that I haven't been here before? "" That's the question I kept asking myself. I was greeted by a Polynesian looking girl who took my order. The menu was mounted on the wall behind her. I loved the simplicity of choices. They had hot and cold sandwiches to choose from as well as a kiddie menue. Here's what I tried n nPastrami Nami Whenever I try out a new sandwich shop, my experience is ALWAYS determined by the type of pastrami sandwich they offer. This visit was no difference. Their pastrami nami said it contains thick cuts of pastrami, sandwiched between two slices of Rye bread, accompanied with brown mustard and cole slaw. Done and done. I chose the whole sandwich, Lay's chips and a soda. n nUhh.maybe the ambiance would have made my sandwich experience better. I decided to take my lunch home so I could get an unbiased opinion of the sandwich and not persuaded by the ambiance LOL. The only thing I could say was that I've have much better experiences with pastrami sandwiches.like from Subway. True, the pastrami was thick, but dry. The Rye slices were super thick and not a combo I would have chosen for my sandwich. The cole slaw was premade and tasted a little old, to me. In other words, I've had better. Thank goodness for the mustard, or that sandwich would have been a complete bust for me. To top it off, the entire meal, counting tip, was about 13 dollars! A little excessive for a mediocre experience. n nTo be completely fair, there was a nice size crowd in this place. Everyone seemed to be enjoying each other's company and the restaurant. I really appreciate it when a business creates such an ambiance. If I ever decide to re visit this place, I will decide to eat my sandwich within the restaurant. I truly believe that your surroundings sometimes has an effect on your overall experience, including the taste. I will also try another sandwich that caught my eye on the menu the Ranch Club Chicken with added Avocado.",1
One of the best Asian places in Phoenix. This is the first restaurant to make me want to leave a review. The sauces for the pork and spring rolls are Perfect. I had the orange chicken and I would say its the second best I've had in Phoenix. My dad had the Kung Pao chicken and it was amazing as well. The Service was excellent and the newly renovated restaurant is great looking.,2
"I just got back from this club and it was disappointing on a Sat night. The worst thing that I could not get over is the horrible music they were playing all night, songs like Jump Jump, The Jackson 5, and Sweet Home Alabama for crying out loud. Where is the Hip Hop? House music? I also got bottle service and the dance floor was so small that all these people were basically in our lap. What's the point of having a bouncer? All the staff were really nice and personable but they really need to get a better DJ. I thought I was in TJ at Senor Frogs. Much better clubs to go to in my opinion.",1
Very scenic. Went here on a mini roadtrip and took lots of pictures. Great place to reconnect with nature without going too far out of the city.,2
"Stopped in here for some camera assistance during the protest. They were so busy they forgot to lock the door at closing and people were still coming in. They were very nice about it, worked with the customers and were very patient for us to finish our shopping and make our purchases.",2
The Italian beef was delicious! I haven't tried anything else but the Italian beef is better than most that I've had. n nThe bread was tasty and the au jus definitely made it better. n nIt is a little pricey but I'd eat here again.,2
"Had high hopes for a good close by Mexican food restaurant but this one failed. The chips and salsa were great but when it took forever for our food to arrive, our server said some of our food went to the table next to us because that server was faster! The food wasn't that great even after the wait and there was no offer to make our experience better either. Never again!",1
I like this store. They are knowledgable and friendly.,2
"This is a pretty cool place for Italian Ice, which reminds me of shaved ice or icee type of dessert! n na. Brain Freeze This stuff reminds me of shaved ice, but smoother, or like an icee, but a bit thicker! No matter what, if you chow down on this stuff, you willl get the inevitable brain freeze! For texture and taste and all, I give this a 4 star. n nb. Italian Ice Flavors They have all sorts of really cool flavors that are surprisingly good. You will not find cold stone ben and jerry type of flavors, packed with ingredients. Instead, you will find such things as mango, cherry, cantaloupe, blubbery, honeydew, key lime, pineapple and other tasty flavors. Kids will be attracted to sour patch kids red and swedish fish. I haven't tried those, but I can imagine they will be pretty good! 4 star for taste and 5 star for creativity, so 4.5 star here. n nc. Dessert Sugar Free they do have some sugar free stuff for those of you watching your intake. These are sweetened with Splenda, so as long as that is a product you can consume, go for it. They have a lot of flavors, but seems that at certain times, they only have a sampling out of 1 3 types. 4 star. n nd. Other stuff They have Cream Ice, Frozen Custard, Gelati, Misto and Blendini. YOu all know what Frozen Custard is, I haven't tried it here. The Cream Ice is just like the ice that is the main attraction to Rita's but with Cream so it is silky smooth and a really rich flavor. Gelatai is a combo of their Italian Ice and Frozen Custard. The Blendini is where you use the Italian ice, frozen custard and then add in toppings lke Oreo, Heath Toffee, Snickers and etc. So, if you want or need the more rich and candy like flavor of traditional ice cream, this could be your choice 4 star. n ne. Misto this is the Italian Ice and Frozen Custard made into a drink, more like the icee we all grew up with. All the other products you use a spoon, this one, you use a straw! n nThis is a very small, but nice place. Only seating is two benches outside on the curb facing the cars and so, not a place to hang out and chill out. While a problem, if you are with a group, you will be standing on the curb of the parking lot and clogging up the store front. Otherwise, this is a nice alternative to your traditional cold desserts! n nGK says check it out!",2
"Just not good. n nOrdered 2 wings which came with 2 sides I chose macncheese and refried beans. Wings were fried, slightly overcooked, and had no flavor. No salty, no seasony, nothing. Macncheese tasted a couple of elbow noodles swimming in warmed cream, with a tablespoon of actual cheese plopped in the cup. Refried beans were soupy and slightly undercooked. n nAlso ordered a wing, drumstick thigh which came with 2 sides which were chosen as fries and corn on the cob. The man agreed his chicken was also slightly overcooked, no salt, no seasony, nothing. Fries were that cool spiral cut concept but were chewy, greasy and soggy. Corn was corn haha. n nI was hopeful that they would have a different style of fried chicken like at Pollo Campero. Eek! Methinks not. At the end of the meal, we came to the consensus they got everything they attempted wrong, absolutely wrong. Im sad for them and sad for my 15.00 dollars. I didnt even wanna write this review however I know this is exactly what Yelp is for. I took one for the team tonight. We win most and we lose some, I definitely lost tonight. n nupdate weird how all the reviews for this place are yelped by randoms with only 1 review and sound like advertisements haha.weird",1
"When I lived in Vegas, this was my favorite buffet. I guess we all have favorites in one form or another. The biggest favorite in my life is of course, food. n nI visited Vegas recently and decided that I wanted to have dinner with friends at Main Street Station Buffet MSSB on Christmas Eve. I soon discovered that this isn't the place you want to spend anytime at, no matter what the occasion. It was just that bad. The broccoli spears were ice cold and limp. Need I say more? All other fare left much to be desired and my table mates were not raving about much of anything either. For me the highlight of eating at MSSB used to be the bread pudding. Trust me, it's not the same. As we continued with our meal, a wave of guilt swept over me for even suggesting this place. I sought redemption and they ultimately forgave me. n nOnce upon a time in Vegas, you could get a good buffet really cheap. Mainstreet remains one of the cheapest at about 10 bucks with all the rest approaching 20 or more. Can you imagine spending 20 bucks for a buffet? You don't even get table service except to clear your used plates and refill your drink, if you're lucky. That's what you have to do anymore to get any semblance off quality and MSSB has missed the boat",1
"I could not be more pleased with my experience yesterday. Kevin went above and beyond, to accommodate me. My old chewed up nails, became beautiful, and I felt like a new person.",2
"I wanted to say first that I tried my hardest to like this and I really wanted to like it. However , for a Vegas show at the Wynn there is so much that could of improved it. The music is good obviously because it is just play Sinatra tracks. nObviously there is a lot of dancing but, there needs to be stage transitions and the storyline is very weak. nThis is really a show you expect at Imperial Palace or Flamingo. Thankfully the show was half off on Travel Zoo. The most entertaining thing I saw when the show was over I had no clue Mario Lopez was sitting in front of me. Slater!",1
"Like I have said before, one should try something at least 3 times before x'ing it, and I sure did for this restaurant. n nMy friend and I have ordered different stuff to try and find something that I would like.I have gift certificates. These are the items I have tried n Grilled Pork Rolls had better at Bosa Restaurant n House Special Sandwich Mayo? WTH? Can't they just whip up some egg whites and oil? n Beef Stew w French Roll very bland n Curry Goat w French Roll Goat was like rubber, very chewy n Combination Flower Roll this is usually my favorite, but not here n Combo Pork and Egg Rice Plate wasn't good, but maybe it's because they lost the ticket and didn't get this dish out until 45 mins later n nMaybe it's because of such an extensive menu, so attention isn't being put into any individual item, but that's not an excuse it is? I've been watching alot of Kitchen Nightmares, and if they cut down their menu, the food maybe better. n nHowever, I won't be returning to this restaurant, probably ever again. ",1
"I do not even know where to BEGIN. nFirst. I did review this place months back after taking my little dog here for a bath and nail trim. it was 17. She is 6lbs All was well. A couple months later I brought my other little dog in for a hair cut. Shaved all down. He is 6 lbs it was 17. Last weekend I took BOTH little dogs in. It almost 60. Something didn't add up. I simply stated it seemed higher then the previous times. She said she did not have a record for my 2nd little dog. Weird? Well I do. I have the bank statement of 17 and a picture I took of him same day leaving their place. The groomer called me later that day and said it bothered her I thought it was more expensive last time and that she would ""check her records. "" And call me back because that ""isnt a way to run a business. "" Weird? You told me you didn't have a record for my dog? So. I checked MY banks statements from October last time he got a cut 17. I called her back to let her know. I don't want the 22 back. I just wanted her to know. She said ""I'm sorry! What is your phone number and name again so I can check my records at home for October. I will call you tomorrow! "" Weird? A week later. Still haven't heard from them. n nSECOND. The last after my 6 lb dog left there. Every time you would touch her back she would yelp out of pain. 2 trips to the vet later. She is now on two antibiotic steroids for a SKIN INFECTION. Her entire back skin under her fur is basically peeling. It is awful. My vet said this is the second complaint on this groomer. n nI am not happy and will NEVER take my dogs back here.",1
"We live in Vegas and have enjoyed dozens of restaurants from fine to walk ups. Rarely do we not get a good meal. We tried this one on a Sunday afternoon and should have turned around as soon as the snotty hostess seated us next to the silverware station when very few of the tables were occupied. We asked a few questions about the menu and were told, ""You have to order bunches of them. "" Tacos were 10.50 to 5.85. After seeing the tiny taco at the next table I ordered the shrimp and ham with cellophane noodles. My wife ordered salt and pepper tofu. What I got was a small bowl of tasteless soup with two shrimp, that I had to de head, and some tofu. My wife got four small pieces of tofu on a plate. Without drinks we spent 40 dollars and were hungry and angry we'ed been had.",1
"Great service, great ambiance, delicious food. Not too greasy. When they say they'll cook your burger Medium, you actually get a medium slightly pink in middle. I always get a doggie bag the portions are generous. Sat on the patio, music was a little louder than I'd prefer had to hear at my old age .",2
"Despite the fact that this place is in a little trendy part of Henderson, and that there are power luchers everywhere enjoying thei meals, I didn't care much for the place. I am all about eating a yummy kefta, I have even perfected the act of making them at home. When my order came out everything looked great. I was so excited to dig in! But I have to say, the flavors fell short.or maybe there were too many flavors. Can that even happen? Well, the flavors were not really spicy, per se, but there were so many in the beef kefta that I was over whelmed. I was burping up my food until I went to bed that night. Not fun.",1

"The people of yelp are giving this hotel more credit than it deserves. n nYes, their prices are cheaper than the other hotel casinos here, it's quite a steal to be honest. n nFor our Vegas trip, we booked a room here. the problem? We booked a King non smoking room and ended up cancelling it and asking for our money back because apparently they ran out of single king rooms. n nReally? n nREALLY?!? n nIt wasn't like we booked it the day before, we actually had this booked in advance and it was plenty of time for them to notify that they had no more available. What was really stupid was that we have to walk across the casino up five floors, open the door to find out ourselves. We went back and they gave us the ""our reservation was based on availability only "" excuse. n nW. T. F. n nTheir food there was pretty bad too, I'm sure my boyfriend could cook better food and he's not very good at cooking too . Good thing it was free cause of the coupons they gave us.",1

"Stopped for a quick lunch. Certainly a hole in the wall place. We ate at the counter, there were tvs to entertain us. Had a slice of mushroom and white pizza. The white pizza was nice and garlicy. The mushroom pizza needed something to give it a bit more kick. The crust on both pizza were crispy thin. 5 a slice was a little steep, I would like to see them offer some sort of combo meal including a drink but maybe most people just order whole pizzas and take them back to thier room. The staff wasn't super friendly I asked what kind of pizza they had by the slice and the cashier just pointed to the pizzas. I had to ask again for her to tell me the toppings. Service was quite fast.",2
Came to mini to look at a mini and the sales man was so rude I about punched him in the face. So then I go talk to the manager and explain to him what happen and then the salesman goes inside and tells everyone what happened and they turn around and look at me through the window and start laughing I would never come to many of Las Vegas to purchase a vehicle,1
"Tried to get my oil change and tires rotated on my truck here today, but I decided against it because apparently one of their jacks is broken. That means that they only have one jack, which is being used all the time, which means that its probably about to break as well. It's definitely not going to be my truck that falls to the ground when this jack breaks. I also went to another Jiffy Lube near by on Apache and McClintock, same story.",1
"Very disappointed. Shrimp and Pork Siu Mai had little flavor and no seasoning. The Superior Wonton Soup tasted more like water from Lake Superior. I ordered the soup recommended by the server but was then informed the soup was not available. I saw John Curtis a local food critic there eating with Andy Wang, if they give this place a good review we know they were comped. I will stick with my favorites on Spring Mountain , which is a shame because I can walk here from my condo n.",1
"This is a ""must visit "" place if you are anywhere near the Bellagio. It is laid out in a circle, with servers and showcases on the inside, and displays of candies and cookings lining the outside.

"Staying on a sugar rush, Fudge Kitchen sells divine fudge that's smooth, creamy and deeeeeelicious. Using original recipes that date back to the 1830s, they offer dozens of different flavours from old favourites like butterscotch, vanilla and toffee to more ambitious combinations like lemon meringue, strawberries and cream, banoffee bananza and chocolate caramel. n nThe staff are friendly and seem happy for you to nibble samples and watch them making and cutting the fudge. The only drawback is the price. It costs just under a fiver for a single slice and u00a315 u00a320 for a presentation box of 4 6 slices making Fudge Kitchen more of a draw to tourists than locals. n nMaybe I could just try one more sample?

"This place will make you a hot dog fan. For sure. n nI read about Buldogi on Yelp of course, where else?! and decided to give it a try with my son. You're definitely welcomed immediately by the employees as you walk into this small joint. I'm guessing the small amount of tables is adequate because I can see the turnover being pretty fast. There's a few tables chairs outside also, perhaps better for after summer! n nCrazy and creative menu. Look for yourself. It's a hot dog joint, where they offer just your usual ketchup, mustard, relish, but that's not why you come here. My last visit, I had a Banh Mi Dog. Your choice of all beef, turkey, or veggie hot dog, topped with pork belly, banh mi slaw, herbs, and Asian Sriracha mayo. Like I said, crazy hot dogs! n nI think I've finished my first hot dog, so I knew ordering one item to eat was enough for me. I'll have to come back with more people to try those Angry Fries people have been raving about. n nIf you're still not sold on the hot dogs, you can get any of their crazy toppings on a burger. They also have a couple of rice bowls to choose from, which I ordered for my son. Big portion! We took it home, and the leftovers gave him another meal or two. n nThey have a Yelp check in special right now, which is 10 off your order. n nI'm trying to decide which hot dog I'll be ordering next.

"Stopped in with some friends while visiting. The gelato was delicious, the prices were good and the people were very helpful. I got Nutella with Ferrero Rocher and did NOT regret it, let me tell you.

"I had not eaten at this particular Panda until now. The guy behind the counter confused me a little bit because he looked at me like he was ready to take my order, but then started talking to another person behind the counter. Then I started to say what I wanted, but I still didn't have his full attention. Hmph! Had to start giving my order about 3 times before he was ready to listen. The chow mein looked a little sad but I was getting fried rice so it was okay. The mixed veggies were also sad looking but the guy was nice enough to ask my boyfriend if he wanted fresh vegetables he did . A lot of the food actually looked fresh. particularly the honey sesame chicken and sweet fire chicken. But I was getting the teriyaki chicken which is pretty much always fresh. They packed my Panda Bowl with fried rice and teriyaki chicken! Impressive. I noticed the sign saying their ice maker was broken so we made the decision to take our food to go so we could split a large Panda Passion tea and put our own ice cubes in it. My Panda Bowl was still hot when we got home. And it was good! The rice was cooked well and the chicken tasted fresh delicious. Best Panda we've had in awhile. Maybe next time they will have ice and we can dine in. ",2
"First time dining at Binkley's and it was virtually perfect. Environment is comfortable, attractive, and unobtrusive. Same with service warm and available yet never over bearing. The food was completely terrific really creative and memorable every single dish was good though halibut in parchment stood out especially. I love Kai and Elements and would hurry to go back there for the great service and gorgeous setting, but, in terms of the sheer quality of the food, Binkley's is the best restaurant in Phoenix. I am only sorry that it is SO expensive 110. per person with only 2 glasses of wine for 1 of us that we won't be able to dine here more frequently. Outstanding. Do not hesitate to go to Binkley's.",2
"Really cute hotel! It's decorated really nice. I stayed there in March of 2014. It has a cute bistro where you can order cook to order food. Breakfast is amazing. Prices a little steep. But still tasted great. In a good location near a mall, lots of restaurants, movies, and easy freeway access. I highly recommend staying here.",2
"So I've been to D'lish many of times before and I've been meaning to write a review for months but today.I just had to document my experience. n nD'lish always has a pretty big wait and rightfully so. I ordered a banana strawberry smoothie that was killer and a AZ burrito BUT.I got this bad boy enchilada style. Best decision I've made her by far. n nI've had the black bean burger, the bowls, the sandwiches but this burrito enchilada style is the best if I haven't made my point already! Service is always great and friendly and there isn't really much negativity I can bring to the table for this place. n nMaybe one thing is to stay open later! There's not really a place like this and I'd come here a lot more if they were open later too. Keep it up D'lish!",2
Used to love this place but it has gone to s t. The food isn't the same and neither is the atmosphere. My friend got food poisoning from a chicken sandwich he ate here and it messed him up for three days. Save your self a bad meal and walk around the corner. Its no longer the charlotte staple it once was,1
"Can I get a sweet jesus or even a hell ya! Best hot dog I have EVER had! n nThis place is super cute! I love the way it's set up, very open, fits a ton of people, cute little patio out front, they have a convenient drive through and have a great mix of old school Chicago decor, set up in a modern way if that makes any sense n nThe menu is larger then I thought it would be there are salads, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and of course hot dogs! I decided to go with the Jumbo Chili Dog, Cheese fries and a drink! Wish I had room for dessert, or a chocolate shake! Definitely going to order that next time! A lot of places over cook hot dogs, or have awful tasting chili they pile on top. It's nice to actually get a perfectly cooked juicy hot dog, on a delicious seasoned bun, with flavorful chili! Ohhh and the fries! I LOVE crinkle fries. a lot of places stopped serving them! Portillos hit home with me with the crinkle fires! Nice and crispy, crunchy, the way crinkle fries should taste! n nOverall great experience! This place is very laid back, casual, family and date friendly! The staff is very courteous and welcoming! Worth the lines and the kayos! I recommend going later at night around 9pm is when we went I know that is late to eat but there were no lines, received our food in about 5 minutes, sat and enjoyed each others company while people watching and took the long drive home! n nThis specific location is about and hour away from my house, but certainly worth the drive! I can't wait for them to open up their new location this summer at Tempe Market Place! n nGreat night! Thanks for finally making it to AZ Portillos!",2
Disappointed with the customer service. Received furniture 2 months ago. It was delivered with a stained cushion and wrong size table. Have been told for two months I would get the pieces corrected. Can't get a call back from anyone .,1
"Consumer Beware! Beware! before going to this restaurant! They have raised all their prices including Buffet which is now at a ridiculous 14.95 per person! Nowhere do they inform you of the new prices until u get the bill! we ordered from the menu as well and the quantity is a JOKE even one person cannot eat on the ridiculously priced dal! n nThe buffet was even worse with STALE food, empty buffet trays that were being refilled at snails pace with just a few pieces of chicken that are now cut in half than previously served. Dessert milk had gone bas with pungent taste, bread was cold, tixe was hard as a rock which means it was from the day before and re heated ! Glasses smelled similar to foul meat which means not cleaned thoroughly. We are very dissappointed we were regulars at this restaurant and don't know what happened! Maybe its new management or maybe its just the want to make money and let go of quality and serve your customers horrendous quality of food whatever the case they have gone downhill! Save yourself the bad experience and do not eat here not worth it anymore! for this price you can eat at a fancy restaurant in vegas! n nOn a positive note the waiters are nice. and thats about it on the niceness part. n nA note to management do not rip un suspecting customers your prices have gone up and quality is horrible!",1
"Congratulations, Perkins! You've won my award for worst food in CU. n nThe winner is a 1 4 "" chicken patty that spurts grease when bitten into! And said patty was definitely not a normal breast. More like old school McNuggets. n nYUCK.",1
"I hate to write a review for a local hardware store so conveniently located in my backyard, but recent service I received when purchasing window screens for my home was less than ideal. As for running into Ace for small items for the home I think they do a great job with keeping a large and ample inventory. They are very friendly and knowledgeable as well. However, if you choose to do a larger project or make a larger purchase in which they will utilize a sub contractor for the work, be careful. n nIn my experience Foothills Ace takes a total lack of ownership over the process and quality of their sub contractors. Working with the General Manager Pat was also a challenge. Ace says in their website that ""helping their customer is their first priority "". That is not the case with these more expensive jobs. I am totally disappointed with the lack of ownership and follow thru from Pat and Greg with Armadillo LLC. At this time, my attempts to speak with owner Kevin Cash have gone unanswered. I will continue to patronize Ace and support local business for my small ticket items, but it is doubtful I will ever use them again for more detailed projects which is too bad.",1
"Well maybe it's because they are new and still ironing out the kinks but they have been open for at least a month now so as far as in concerned they should be past the rookie stage. Place was sloooooow. Sandwiches were no better than a subway or quiznos. And to top it off, they failed on 2 of our 4 orders TWICE! TWICE! That's 4 failed attempts folks! And, I saw other orders being brought back as well. Maybe that explains why it was so slow, all the remakes. nDon't order a kids grilled cheese btw. Even my kid laughed at it. Literally, no cheese in between. Plus, you mark the ""white American cheese "" slot, yet the manager tells me, when I request white American for my wife's sandwich, that they don't use white American. When I questioned about the white American selection on the kids gr. cheese, he said its mozzarella! Nothing at all like white American! Are you kidding me here folks? This place will be gone within 6 months. Any takers?",1
"I have been to this place a couple of times and so far each time has been a great experience for the most part. The food is awesome, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly definitely family oriented, with a lot of outdoor seating . n nOut of the two times that I have been here, I have tried their fontina burger, the pesto chicken sandwich, the sweet potato fries, and the garlic fries. The burger was delicious, the chicken in the pesto chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection, and the fries were awesome although, the garlic fries had too much garlic for my taste . n nThe only downside is that this place is always packed or at least the two times that I have been here . It was featured on the Food Network, so I kind of knew that it was a popular place. But the funny thing is that I thought if going at a later time for lunch and on a weekday that it wouldn't be bad, but I was wrong and the line was still out the door. Also, I kind of wanted to try their milkshakes, but the line was way too long to get back into sort of wish they had an express line for desserts . n nOh, and check out their restroom for a weird funny surprise.",2
"I found Dr. Rick Roybal at Arora on yelp.com and gave him a try. Talk about serendipity! This guy is the BEST Chiropractor I've ever used! nWhen I walked in there I was walking in severe pain from old auto accidents, stress and a multitude of sins I just let go until I got to the breaking point meaning I couldn't stand more than about 10 minutes at most and walking had become super painful and slow. My hips were twisted again from an old motorcycle accident which throws off everything it seems, and because of some previously painful and questionable work done by a Chiro in Illinois I never went back to one when I came to Arizona. nMy regular Phoenix Physician wanted to send me to a Pain Management Dr. so he could what? Mask the pain I guess which seemed awfully stupid to me, so I bit the bullet and started looking for a local Chiro here. I'm so glad I did, too.and soooo glad I found Dr. Rick especially. nSince my experiences with two other old time Chiros in llinois used old school techniques I went in there kinda scared you know what I mean with the twisting of the neck and the cracking and all. I was always sure I was going to end up a paraplegic. They were rough, their treatments didn't last all that long and they didn't suggest any after care or exercises just come see me again when you can't walk without pain. Kinda discouraging really. nDr. Rick uses new techniques which I had never experienced before which are much more gentle and a heckofalot less scary but get the job done. He will suggest exercises and after care if needed. He WILL take care of you because he really CARES about his patients you can tell it , he loves his work again, you can tell it and he will listen carefully to what you tell him throughout your appointment and will answer any questions about your care that you have. nHe's very professional, and seems to have absolutely no problem in educating his patients on what he is doing and why. Frankly, I never had a Chiro do that before and I really appreciate it. He even makes his cell phone number accessible and encourages you to call him with any questions you might have after you leave there.can you imagine that one? nVery low rates and excellent service. I cannot give any more stars to this Chiropractor, but, if I could, I would, I am extremely happy with his work and am getting my friends to go to him, too. He's making me well, and I'm so very grateful for his skill, knowledge and caring.thanks for enabling me to live sans pain, Dr. Rick! And just as much, thank you for not charging me an arm and a leg for doing it!",2
I am a total fan of the Zorba and the Porky. I follow them on facebook and when they are downtown at the El Cortez or somewhere close to the downtown area I go to where they are. I can't get enough of my two favorite sandwiches!,2
"I was so excited to try this new, nearby Mexican restaurant, only to be thoroughly disappointed. The staff was not welcoming. The prices are not competitive. The portions were ridiculously small. A burrito double the size is available at Gordo's a stone's throw away and for a lesser price! The salsa did not knock my socks off. My Enchiladas had barely any filling and the sauce on top was slight and dry. I will not be returning.",1
Went last Sunday waited an hour after ordering and waitress never said any thing to us so we asked for a take out and that took another 15 min food was ok but how about some communication,1
"Service was extremely slow. We sat at our table for quite a while before we were waited on. Once we ordered the server brought cornbread right away. It's good but, not what I was expecting. We both ordered the fried chicken. It was cold and soggy. The mac and cheese was good but again, it's Mac and cheese. The server was really sweet but not attentive to the table. Food was just ok. Wouldn't go back.",1
"OMG! i had the best experience today! their service was on point! we had a server annette, she was excellent and funny! they had 6 different sauces to choose from and she gave a very descriptive ""sauce tour "". it was cute! i ordered bbq chicken that comes with corn on a cob, cornbread and two sides. jalepeno mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes sides were so delicious! i loved their cornbread! definitely consider sharing cause everyone in our party couldn't finish their meals!",2
"Didn't find this place on Yelp like we usually do we were from out of town . We were driving by and just decided to try it out. Bad mistake! First, we waited forever to order over 45min . They didn't come over until we finally said that we were ready. When the guy came over my husband was prepared to order for the whole table. We had 10 people all together my parents, my hubby's parents and some of his relatives . My husband started to order and he was trying to get the order straight in his mind because he didn't want to mess up my dad's order he's on a special diet because he's diabetic . The guy got annoyed said we weren't ready rolled his eyes and left to help someone paying at the register. We were shocked that he just left. He finally came back and took our order with attitude. My husband was so upset and wanted to leave telling his mom that he shouldn't talk to customer's that way but she talked him into staying. A long time later our food finally came except for mine.I didn't want to ask for it because I didn't want them to spit in it . My mom got her food and she was supposed to have Noodles but there was none. We didn't say anything, my mom still ate it. The guy was passing around the pho and asking who had the one he was holding while he stood right beside my mother in law. She said, ""right here. "" And he continued to ask with attitude. Wrong thing to do w my mother in law. She slammed her chopsticks down and yelled at him, ""right here! "" Then she proceeded to yell at him about how her son wanted to leave but she talked him to staying and why does he have to talk to us that way. The whole table couldn't even enjoy their food. And I just watched everyone else eat because remember I never got my order. If I could give this place no stars I would. My hubby was still angry hours later and it's just sad that someone can ruin your whole day like that. I would NEVER come here again!",1
"Not worth it. Portions are tiny, have to order twice, most of their rolls have 'Cajun' rub, not many choices for the price they offer. nOur server was okay but alittle off. I first ordered gyoza and after getting everything we ordered I told him I never got my gyoza his response was, ""I never heard u say that "" clearly my girl friend I came with heard me and so I said ok can I get an order he walks away. Then we ask to order more, we put an order in for two more rolls, waited 10 mins he comes back and asks if we wanna order dessert so we order that and he brings them over so me and my friend look at each other confused bc we ordered two more rolls and he clearly didn't put that order in so we just paid and left. Totally by wort it and I recommend trying to ignore that server never even got his name! nYama on flamingo and Maryland is the best ayce sushi too bad they don't stay open late or we would of gone there!",1
"Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the ""orange chicken "" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting.",1
This place is in need of some huge management change. My husband and I sat outside on the patio for a couple burgers last night and were appalled at what we saw. There were 4 tables that left shortly after we got there and when we finished our dinner 40 min later no one had cleared the tables. My husband had to stare at half eaten burgers during our entire dinner. It was so bad that a group of young boys came to get some food and cleared their own table. Are you kidding me?! It was so ridiculous. Not to mention our fries were cold. How do you mess up a burger and fries. We asked to talk with the manager and she just told us they have been very busy. No real apologies or anything. The only reason i give this a 1 is because our server was half way decent. She did not have the tables that weren't cleared. She did take our plates thank goodness. We have been coming here for years but will never return!,1
"Given that it is a Darden restaurant and our proclivities lean AWAY from chains , we tried Seasons 52 mostly because we had accumulated a bunch of gift cards, and we knew we didn't want to waste them at Red Lobster. n nWow were we surprised. Beautiful, dark interior with nice mood lighting MUCH bigger than we anticipated. The place was packed on a Saturday night there was a great big bar with lots of people hanging around. The waitstaff was impeccable the restaurant cares enough about their staff to give them business cards to hand out. n nThe food was amazing. They change it seasonally, so don't expect your favorite dish every time you go. All the food is under 475 calories. Seriously, no need to worry about ""what "" you are eating because it is good for you AND tastes amazing. Wine is cheap! Ours was only 36 for a great bottle of Malbec. And they make these little personal deserts that are the perfect size for 2.50. n nOnly negative? LOTS of snowbirds Not that they bothered us, but it wasn't a young, hip crowd unless you were by the bar .",2
"SF Las Vegas Supermarket is our go to place for Asian groceries. Sure, we used to hit up the original SF Super up the street, but definitely appreciate the greater space and larger variety of goodies at this location. We've been known to leave the other Asian supermarkets in the area just to come here for our needs. n nYou'll usually find me in the produce section it's our first stop since it's conveniently located directly to the left when you walk in. And depending on what's on the menu, then we'll maneuver our way to the back for protein and seafood. I find them to have the cheapest prices with the highest turnover on produce, with a good selection. n nAnd like Jade W. said, wider aisles are always appreciated! n nIt doesn't hurt that they are conveniently located across the street from Hot N Juicy Crawfish, and in the same shopping center as Big Lots, Woo Che, and Honey Pig!",2
"I grew up in the West Valley, and I was so disappointed when Water world closed down. I loved everything about that place from the urban myth that someone died on Mt. Kilimanjaro to the crusty nachos. But when Wet'n'Wild started to build those brightly colored slides I got over my disappointment. Only to be let down again. n nNot only is Wet'n'Wild WAY overpriced, but Waterworld offered much more to do for a day's visit. The slides are fun once or twice, but the two hour wait is not worth it. And even the wave pool has lost its old luster. n nI guess everyone has to visit Wet'n'Wild at least once to get it out of their system. And to see just how the hell that funnel looking contraption works. Take it from me, Wet'n'Wild is just not worth it.",1
"This company is a bully. Abusing their power and policy. You guys need to do some changes. We had issue with our account and couldn't pay it get the phone. Customer service rep was horrible. Didn't help. I have money on the account and can't Ben pay online,debit card, or credit card. Must be cash. Fine. We went to kiosk same thing aps placed account into collections. I have money sitting in my account and can't even pay and rep tell me I need to pay at kiosk but can't. Told to wait until Monday morning but the Shut Off is possible and scheduled. A.G. Needs to look this company up and APS be shamed of yourselves. You need to change your board and senior management. This is abuse and inconvenient.",1
"Lunch specials are good. Great Mexican food, close by. Had fajitas. The decor could be updated and service at first is a bit slow, overall good.",2
"Your liking disliking of Murrayfield will inevitably be proportional to your liking disliking of the game of rugby itself. I'm not particularly keen, but that's more to do with the fans rather than the game, which despite having a few flaws too much scoring, it's often beneficial to kick the ball out of the field has the potential to be very exciting. n nHaving grown up with football, a game open to all races and walks of life, which shows both social and cultural influences miles away from the stadium, rugby does however feel like a bit of a non event. It has a very niche market, and a fairly large proportion of the fans that go do it solely as they feel it heightens their social status among the paved driveways of the suburban, culturally vapid middle class. n nI want my fans at the stadium to be baying for blood, I want ""welcome to hell "" banners and riot police firing tear gas. I don't want some drunken poshos singing inoffensive songs and exchanging jovial banter with their rivals. n nI do get mildly sucked in during the Six Nations occasionally mind you, and in terms of the stadium itself, you won't find a much more sizeable or well appointed arena than this one. I just wish I could watch a highly organised, tactical 0 0 draw from it's stands.",2
"My brother is visiting from Seattle, where apparently they do not have In 'n' Out Burgers! So of course we had to go. The menu could not be simpler, and for once, a fast food burger looks like what's advertised. Will definitely go again when I'm craving a burger and fries.",2
"I think Treasure Island is a solid bet for those wanting an affordable and centrally located hotel in Las Vegas. Rooms were not super lush but very adequate. The first night we checked in, we got the handicapped access room and we didn't like the shower set up in the bathroom. The front desk got us a new room the next day and as my parents were coming in then, arranged for adjoining rooms. n nWe booked through Priceline and got a pretty good deal although the Resort Fee is a bit annoying at 28 day. This gave us a 2 for 1 buffet coupon, free access to the gym, wi fi, local telephone service. n nBeds were comfortable. Flat screen TV's were ridiculously small. Elevators were fast. Casino was good . paid 3 2 on blackjack important because a number of casinos are cutting the pay off to 6 5 . Location was great! We took the tram to Mirage a few times and the bridge over to the Palazzo for Walgreens and Bouchon Bakery. I would stay here again.",2
"This is a very nice hotel resort. Depending on what you're in Vegas for, this may or may not suit your needs, mostly due to its proximity to ""the action "" on The Strip. The hotel sits at the very north end of The Strip and it's a bit of a walk before you get to the heart of The Strip. Walking to Mandalay Bay the southern end of The Strip will have you walking three and a half miles! A car rental or bus pass will suit you well if the casinos are on your agenda. If they're not, this hotel is in an excellent location. It's quiet, close to the Stratosphere and has easy access to I 15 via Sahara Ave. The staff are very nice and accomodating. The pool is comfortable, but could certainly be a bit bigger. Get more than twenty people in one of the two halves of the pool it's split into two and you start getting a little cramped. The Marketplace in the hotel is most certainly convenient but don't order a sandwich there unless you've got A LOT of time. On the day we arrived Saturday , we stopped in there to grab a sandwich and it must have taken at least twenty minutes to get through the five or so people in line ahead of me to even place my order and another twenty minutes or so to get my sandwich! Fourty minutes and 24 later, I had my Cuban sandwich, garden salad, Gatorade, and Water! Things are very pricey and the service is generally slow. Parking is convenient right next to the hotel with a surface lot and a 10 level parking garage. Would I stay here again? Maybe, but it would depend on what I was in Vegas for!",2
"Hmm. This place was pretty lame. The food is not yummy, and I cant believe the prices! 6.95 for a kids meal!? NUTS! The food is blah and the staff is nice. n nI woulda rather went to Viva Michoacan.",1
"This is very good Chicago deep dish pizza! However, unless you live in San Tan Valley or Queen Creek, be ready for a long drive to get there. I am not saying it is not worth drive though! If you do live in this area and have not tried Buddy's, I would go tonight! I would be surprised however, if any pizza lovers in this area have not tried Buddy'z. n nI only tried the deep dish which was great, but the thin crusts that kept whizzing by our table looked delicious as well. We waited about 45 minutes for our deep dish, so I think we will try the thin crust next time. n nIf you want an even better deep dish and you are in the Chandler South Tempe area go to Full House Pizza, it's the best in the Valley by far!",2
"I don't like to review chains normally but this place really pissed me off. n nBoyfriend and I like eating at the one near our house and a co worker likes eating here often as well so we decided to go for what we thought was a quick lunch. n nWe show up and understandably they are busy.that's fine, we can deal its lunch time. We sit outside in the sun, which was hot but ok since we are inside all day anyway. Our waitress comes by and doesn't introduce herself or even say hi. She was very monotone and seemed like she was just mad at the day. I know it happens, we all go through those moments or days, but even when I was pissed or tired as a waitress, I was pleasant because I knew this was how I was going to make my money. n nSo she takes our order. I order the turkey sandwich special and my friend orders the chicken with taziki sp? . Pretty simple stuff. Well we wait.and wait.and wait.and see people get their food who sat down and ordered after us.and we wait some more. She didn't bother to come out and talk to us or give us any info, updates or apologies but only when she checked on another table did she realize that we didn't have our food yet and had gone through two drinks each already. I know things happen, when you're busy things aren't ordered.anyone in the serving business has done it, but its how you handle it after the fact that matters. Never once did we get an apology or anything! n nWhen we finally got our food, my ""toasted "" sandwich was cold and the ""hot "" potatoes that came with it were cold as well. Unfortunately it was one of those situations where 1. I didn't want to be that customer despite the overwhelming feeling that I should be, and 2. I was too hungry and had waited FAR too long to wait any longer and we needed to get back to work. n nThe couple next to us as well as my friend received dirty glasses with lipstick stains and detergent on them which again, happens but it just added fuel to the fire. n nMy food was only OK despite knowing that Pita Jungle can serve up way better than what they gave us this time around. I will not go back to this location but will to the one close to my house.",1
"I'm almost reluctant to even post this because I want to be able to replicate my recent experience next year and fear this could be a 'call something paradise, kiss it goodbye' sort of thing. But this place was tops! n nStarting with the golf course, the only possible nitpicking I could do would be to suggest that the greens were somewhat unsightly. I think through verticutting, the greens had a sort of brown and green striped look to them. But they were firm, fast and rolled very true. Outside of that the course was excellent. Landing areas for the tee shots were pretty large and the approach shots and greens were very challenging. The course layout required many different shots and was interesting to play. While not spectacular there were views towards Phoenix. n nAlone the course itself would be at least 4 stars but what makes it a definite 5 star rating was the total package. The all inclusive rate was an incredible deal. For just slightly more than an average rate so much less than any of the higher priced courses we received unlimited golf we only played 27 holes , 2 meals breakfast and lunch breakfast was average, lunch was very good , and a couple of drink coupons and a snack coupon for the on course cart. I will definitely return on my next golf trip to Phoenix!",2
"Never had their food, but I am only rating on the bar experience. Went their and people were all dressed up like im talking suit and tie on a friday night. This is montford, now Im in decent get up, but come on. The atmosphere was ok and the drinks were overpriced. For montford aread I would rather hit up Angry ales, Duckworths, or Brazwells.",1
19.60 for the pizza the size of a pen and it took too long,1
This was actually my first time ever eating Thai food. So I decided to come to this place after reading alot of good reviews. After walking in the decorations of the place popped out very nice this is deffenitly a whole in the wall place. I had the PAD SEE EW plate with a level 5 heat spice . When i recieved my plate the portion size was really good. They gave me to choose how spicy i wanted it on a scale of 1 to 10 i chose a 5 the kick it had was good enough to enjoy my food without my lips burning. I like spicy food but enough to enjoy my meal. My GF had the Thai BBQ chicken plate which was surprisingly good as well. They give out a bowl of soup as an appetizer which was so good also. I give this place a solid 5stars because for being my first time eating thai food it didnt disappoint in the taste and portion size. The service was great. And for two plates and drinks i payed less than 20 which is great Because anywere you o out here in vegas there is very little places were you can have decent size portions and good food with drinks for under 20.,2
"The food was really really good. I was so excited about going there, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. So many choices! n n The wait for the food however, was pretty darn long. And some of the friends I had with me got their food spaced really far apart. Like half an hour 45 minutes between a bowl of soup a deeply fabulous lobster bisque that I had to steal a bite of and a sandwich. But the food made it all okay, and I don't think that the wait time is that bad usually. n nI had an eggcellent omelet. Hah. Ham and cheddar with homefries all over it. And smothered in Frank's red hot. Yum. nEven though the wait was long, I want to go back. Tomorrow. n nFYI CASH ONLY",2
"Amazing breakfast! Stop thinking the now OVERPRICED hotel buffets are best when you are in LV ! Yelpers directed me here and they did not disappoint ! Hubby had the Mile High omelet which he said was full of good ham in between smacks! He also wishes he had got the junior as the regular size was huge! If you have kidsI suggest they split a junior. Petunia omelet is loaded with crisp bacon.take your BP meds people! The spuds are crispy, more of a good potato chip than a hash brown but quite tasty. Waffle is light and fluffy with warm syrup! Ooooh the BANANA BREAD. Trust any Yelpers who advise you to get this it is warm, full of nuts you must get it there and extra to go for later! n nJust Gooo!",2
"Three hours for a tow truck to arrive! I called my road assistance service to arrange a tow truck. Quick Pik All Over Towing picked up the call. The first eta 1 hr and 30 min. After waiting 90 min called Quik Pik provider they said they were backed up and it would be another hour. When asked why I wasn't notified they didn't have a response. I asked where the tow truck driver was, dispatcher responded they had no way of tracking. Called back 1 hr 15 min later and BONNIE stated they just got the call an hour ago. I corrected her and she said there was nothing she could do about it and stated they did ""expedite "" my call. Bonnie is not very bright bc if she was sticking to her story of only being an hour why would they expedite my call?! To add she stated that she saw the driver's location on GPS and he was within minutes away. I thought it was pretty amazing that the company had a tracking system installed within 1 hr and 15min. I tried to get Bonnie to give me an estimate and she stated she would have the driver call me immediately with an ETA. That didn't happen. 15 minutes later I called the road assistance service back and explained the situation. They called Bonnie. Bonnie told them a blatant lie and stated she just got off the phone with me not even 5 min ago and she had told me the driver would be there in 15 min. Again not very bright of Bonnie because the road side assistance co and I had been on the phone with each other for more than 5 min at that time. When the tow truck driver arrived approximately 25 minutes later he was courtesy, but the fact that I was left stranded for 3 hrs really is an indication of what this company is all about!",1
"Tried the new location tonight. I probably wouldn't have come in if I knew it was their very first night open. I was a loyal customer at their old location but I don't know what happened to their stellar servers. We sat down quickly, were greeted and brought drinks our server was very nice, we ordered within 10 minuets of sitting down. Unfortunately for the next 45 minuets we waited and waited for our food. First their server told us they were making new waffle batter, then that the chicken tenders were made from scratch so the reason we had to wait longer for our food than the other 5 6 tables that sat down before us was because they ran out of batter and chicken tenders take forever. I don't know for certain if that was the truth because a manager never came over to talk to us or let us know what was happening. It was frustrating seeing people who ordered over 15 minuets after us get their food and almost finish. Unfortunately we ended up leaving after no real explanation or eta on the food. We still paid for our drinks though but unfortunately we won't be back for awhile. Hopefully lolos gets it together. I saw the manager adjusting our bill but no effort to come over and apologize or anything. Being in the industry so long myself I feel like someone dropped the ball tonight not sure who but we were very disappointed.",1
"I needed a new colorist and stylist, after 4 years with my previous I needed a change. After checking reviews, I gave Sonoran Beauty a call. I was able to book an appointment with Caley. I'll be honest I'm very picky and I was very nervous, as my work calls for me speaking to hundreds of people in a seminar format. Caley did not disappoint, the salon is very well decorated and very inviting. I told Caley, I didn't want ash or yellow blonde and my hair came out amazing. Caley is wicked fast at foiling and base. My hair is literally like silk. I asked her to trim me up a bit and texturize and my cut has never looked better. Even my husband said it looked amazing. I can't say enough about Caley. Thank you Caley for making me perfect blonde again!",2
Absolutely terrible service. The waitress ignored us while checking her nails. Drinks are watered down and overpriced. It's a 2 drink minimum and the entire place was empty.,1
"They don't even deserve a star I would rather die on the streets then go here. It's a joke docs don't show up, pain meds aren't give out at the right times, and they have more cleaning crews then nurses and it's not even that clean. Go somewhere else if u can stay as far from this place as possible",1
"Went to Poptastic last night care of yelp and had a great time. Walking in the place was packed and the music was rockin. I dropped my coat off and headed into the crowed. The first table Bryan and I hit up was Sito's Mediterranean. They had a past salad dish and a chick pea salad dish both were served up in little cups and were quite good. Next stop was DiBellas Old Fashion Submarines I had a slice of turkey sub with everything bread and the bread was so good. Maybe the best everything bread I've ever had. Next we needed drinks I chose a Shiraz which was really yummy. Went to a few other tables and then started heading up to the other floors. Stands outs were Donato's with meatballs, porch with a braised beef dish, and Maggie's farm rum which was dragon breath worthy. Stopped by the yelp table spun the wheel and got some Chapstick to add to my collection bid on a few items in the silent auction and headed to the dance floor. Hung out and laughed as some crazy dance moves and a few more snacks that were being passed around. It was a great time. I would have given it 5 stars but the place was so packed it was crazy. Everyone was bumping into each other. I feel like the tables could have been spread out a little more so people weren't so crowded. Also the art I guess I should mention that. It was very neat. I'm personally not artistically talented so I really appreciate those who are. The three dimensional aspect of it was quite unique. Definitely was a great time.",2
"I've sent documents out of this office twice via Priority Mail. Both times it has taken a week or more for the item to be delivered. Priority Mail is supposed to take 2 3 Days. n nIf you have something that has to be delivered quickly. I wouldn't recommend using USPS. Use Fed EX, UPS, hell. use a Carrier Pigeon! If you can figure out any other way, it will probably get there faster than if you use USPS. n nOn this recent episode, I spoke to someone at this office and the excuse I was given is that my item was stuck in Chicago because of a Winter Vortex. I'm no meteorologist, but I do have access to the internet. When I checked Weather dot com it didn't look like there was an extreme snow storm in the past week. n nI spoke to someone at the Arcadia Post Office as well and they could give me no answer as to where my item was currently located. n nDuring all of this, I was fiddling around on the USPS website to see who else I could email, and found this new commercial. n nhttps www.youtube.com watch?v 01rJBQ2IjbQ n nAfter watching that, my Spidey Sense was tingling, or maybe it was just a surge of adrenaline fury after hearing the lady say ""Don't worry, the United States Postal Service will get it there ON TIME with PRIORITY MAIL flat rate shipping "". LIES! n nNot only has USPS screwed me over twice by delivering items late, but now they've sullied the good name of SpiderMan by including him in their filthy web of late package delivery ness. Notice how the YouTube video doesn't allow comments either. Good choice USPS. n nThe only way I will ever use USPS for anything urgent again is if SpiderMan takes the package from my hand and delivers it himself. n nBelieve it or not, this was finally resolved. I ended up having to file a missing package case with the USPS customer service hotline. They gave me a case number and to their credit, that seemed to prod someone. Two days later my package was finally scanned and started its course again. What should have taken 2 3 days, took 10 days. On the bright side, at least it wasn't truly lost forever, but WTF. talk about frustrating. n nThis was going to be my second 1 star review, but after receiving 2 follow up calls from Kim who works at this location, I bumped it up to two. I appreciate her being efficient and thorough. even if the USPS system is not.",1
"Absolutely an amzimg hospital. Really fun for children when your in there are different colors. A childrens play room.

I reccomend this hospital. Thank you to all the staff.",2
"this was my first time at this hotel. WOW. by no means am I a big spender gambler, but this place is awesome. If ever you get a chance to stay here do it. I stayed at their ""standard "" resort room and i was very impressed. There was so much space in the room I just kept wandering around in there. The bathroom was great. A tub that I could lay my big but in was truly amazing, and watching tv or listen to the music while relaxing in the tub what more could I ask for, well to have a jacuzzi tub, but oh well. Also coming in to the room after a day of walking around, and losing money, it was nice to see the beds made, the lights turned down, classical music playing and a piece of chocolate waiting for me next to the bed. n nThe Casino seemed kind of small compared to the MGM or the New York New York, but like I said I'm not much of a gambler. I did find my favorite game there though. n nI didn't get a chance to go to any of the restaurants here, but maybe next time. n nI didn't get down to the pool, but my girlfriend said the pool was very nice. The best part was that there were no kids running around screaming their heads off! n nIf i ever get a chance to stay here again, I will jump at the opportunity, but alas my budget is and probably always will be NYNY and MGM.",2
Just purchased a brand new truck and wanted to get it clean and brought it to Fabulous Freddy's because we have never had any problems here in the past and after paying for the best car wash they have I found a big scratch above the passenger rear wheel fender. Asked to speak to a manager who came out and said it couldn't have been from the car wash. This truck is my baby and I would have seen the scratch had it been there before. The manager was rude and at the very least he wouldn't refund this car wash. I will no longer reccommend this place nor will I be visiting again.,1
No wheat bread option! And I don't like their white bread either.,1

"We ate here in a family group of five, expecting the previous apparently menu that they had gotten to know and love. We were blindsided by something new. nDespite my fiancee's constant talk of a tetrazzini, 12x in the car ride alone , she looked at me after tasting it and winced. nI was unimpressed with the sirloin and gnocchi dish. Now I'm normally against steak at an Italian place, but the gnocchi looked quite good. nThe sirloin was overcooked and the gnocchi portion was tiny. Le sigh. nYet another Madison place I've visited with high expectations and been confronted with marginal food. nI will say the service was average, not fast, slow or much to comment on.",1
"Two words SMELLY and DIRTY! Do not, I repeat, do not go to Jobot if you are hoping for a good environment, clean areas, or a decent crowd. Is everyone doing these reviews blind?! I am so disappointed too because I kept hearing about Jobot from multiple people, so I really wanted to check it out and see what it was like. The cup of iced coffee I had was good, but that is the only positive comment I can make. The customer service was so so, the crowd there seemed sketchy and I just generally did not feel welcome or comfortable here. I will not be back.",1
Rose and family treat you like family. If you make an appointment you sit right down. Walk ins are accommodated in as time allows. They do not speak Vietnamese to each other like other salons. You are welcomed with a smile. I love the shape miss rose gives my eyebrows. They are competitive priced. I have been visiting this establishment for three years.,2
"On Sunday, March 6th I took my mom in for some lunch. Late lunch.as in we beat the ""Sunday lunch crowd "". Though our BT Server was nice, service took foreverrrrrrrrrrrr. We waited to order about 25 mins and then waited another 40 on our food. We saw two couples receive their food and both we had seen come in and seat after us. Not sure what was going on that day and wish I could post a better review as the food wasn't bad. But the service.SUCKED",1
"This place is pretty much an abortion. I've been here twice now, once for a quick coffee stop mediocre coffee , once for lunch today. What's up with them basically whispering your name when your order is ready? n nThe highlight of my meal which was actually made correctly, but I had to confirm that my order had chips.they were about to let me pay almost 9 for a veggie sandwich and not take a side was watching a guy stroke out on a manger after basically everything in his order was wrong. n nWord to the wise, you have to know the menu and pricing system better than the staff here.",1
"Unfortunately, the trip to India gate restaurant in chandler was a waste of time. The only good thing was that we had a buy one get one free coupon. The staff stood at the bar and stared the entire meal. They even brought us items off of the buffet. and we didn't order the buffet. i expected my food to be freshly prepared. all of it. even the naan. Maybe we hit them on a bad night. None the less, we wont be back.",1
"Superb service! n nWent online and looked up ""sushi "" in Vegas and this one seemed to have some of the best reviews. n nOur waitress was more than hospitable and helpful. She recommended the seaweed salad which was delicious the sushi not sure what kind we got, but it was perfect! was amazing and the beverages were just as refreshing as they were exotic the presentations were lovely as well! n nOverall, I would definitely come back and bring a larger party great for intimate dinners and large parties ",2
"All I have to say is.W.T.F? n nScene 6 people in their early to mid 20's walks into Barcelona. Half of them from New York, the other half from San Francisco or San Fran as the folks in Scottsdale likes to say . Their mouths have dropped and they sit in udder amazement. A band from 1994 gets up on stage and tries to get the crowd of 40 year olds going. With every song played, the folks from separate coasts, just stand there in complete shock.and then THEY DRANK because THEY HAD TO! n nThis place is oh so bad! OH SO BAD! Go if you need a good laugh.",1
"Love this place! Great atmosphere and excellent people watching. The Sunday all day happy hour can't be beat in Scottsdale! It's usually busy but the wait staff does a good job keeping up. I work till 5 on Sundays so it's great to have a place to chill with friends, eat some good sushi and rock out to some tunes after a long day, without breaking the bank.",2
It has been 1 year since I went to El Chorro. Went to Sunday brunch last week and was very disappointed. Ordered eggs Benedict and got cooked salmon on the bottom that was salty and a very small English muffin. Eggs Benedict should have lox or cured salmon . I could have cooked a better dish at home . Not worth the money. The service was good but the kitchen needs to do better at making their food worth while. The best eggs Benedict is at St. Francis on camelback rd.,1
"I love this place, I would have gave it 5 stars but when I got my room the floor was soaking wet and I learned that the aircon was leaking. They immediately offered to switch my room, but I already started drinking, and didn't want to move. This place is a good modern sexy joint for you and some others. There's a fold out couch, incase your random strangers decide to crash the night away. Anyway, there's a stove, a dining area, a microwave, and an awesome bathroom. Vdara has an amazing view to the strip as well. City center is the place to be if you're trying to be on the central strip. Otherwise I really liked staying here because there wasn't a casino down below, it was retail.my favorite!",2
"I needed a zipper fixed on a skirt and I was sent here by the people Del Ray Cleaners since they do not do alterations and Sunset is in the same plaza. The woman I spoke to told me the skirt would be done the next day. When I arrived after the set time, she told me the skirt wasn't done and to come back later. When I went in again the next day she didn't have the skirt at the shop and had to call her granddaughter to bicycle it over from home. When I got home, I realized that even though she had replaced the actual zipper, she had sewn it incorrectly so it was not attached to the skirt. Also, it smelled pretty bad so I had to get it dry cleaned again. I don't know if this is how they normally do business there, but I don't care for it.",1
Their chocolate mint and strawberry flavors are my favorites! n nBring a camera this place has plenty of photo ops!,2
"During a business trip, I visited and found a great selection of cigars with knowledgable suggestions if asked and quite an array of excellent beverage choices to compliment my cigar. A nice relaxed atmosphere with good folks gathered to relax, chat and have a great cigar. The staff was helpful and attentive too and the prices were more than fair for top shelf beverages. Swing by, grab a comfy chair and enjoy.",2
Came here for drinks. The bar and restaurant are on the second floor. They have an outdoor patio with an awesome strip view. Their mixed drinks were quite good. One thing that is is that to exit you will have to pass through the gift shop. It's great if you are looking to get some souvenirs on your way out.Not so great if you are just going outside.,2
"This is definitely my new favorite breakfast spot. The service is absolutely wonderful and the decor is the most quaint thing I have seen! They start you off with fresh mini muffins bran and zucchini walnut and they just melt in your mouth with the butter spread on the warm muffin. n nHad the special of the day omelet with swiss cheese, ham, spinach and garlic and oh my goodness was it delicious. n nWe ordered a cinnamon bun to share and it was so yummy, covered in caramel but not too sweet . n nDefinitely must go!",2
"Based on where I live, this is my entrance to the recreation trails that run along the Arizona canal and creeks that have been modified to allow for recreation and water runoff. I like being able to ride my bike away from traffic. At times the paths have quite a few folks walking, jogging, riding and even the occasional horse or skater. There is a 15mph speed limit for bikes in the park but it is largely ignored by the road riders. The furthest I have gone on the ac dc path is 24th street. I actually rode on the paths for about 6 months before I discovered the underpasses on the opposite side of the canal I had been riding on.",2

"Love the food but servers move soooo slow, like it's a fashion show and do not take accountability of the restaurant. I've been here a few times and the service overall can be better. We sat on a very dirty table and asked a server if the table can possibly be wiped. She says ""oh I don't know what that is. It's ok "". Well, it's food. And no it's not really ok, mainly because it only shows lack of accountability. Then we sat for almost 15 mins til we got a menu coz servers forgot we were even there. No system, bad customer service.",1
"Great experience! Upgraded for free to the grand 24th floor , which included a private lounge with breakfast and drinks. Beautiful view of the river pittsburgh. Staff was amazing all around.

"The worst dining experience I have EVER had. I went to Pub 1842 with a group of 9. Our server was horrible and rude. Once we ordered, I was talking to a friend while the server collected the menus and I didn't notice it, instead of just leaving the menu or waiting for me to realize what he was doing, the server just yanked the menu out from under my arms. It startled me. We ordered our food and some appetizers. After 40 minutes, nothing! I couldn't track down any employee, so I got up and looked for the manager. The manager was just as rude. I told him this issues, very politely and all he did was nod his head. No sorry, he didn't even utter a word to me. I walked back to the table and our food was FINALLY there. The appetizers came out with our entrees, 2 of the dishes were messed up and one side dish never even came out. And again no apology. I get it, there are bad nights in food services, I was a waitress. All it takes is an acknowledgement that things got messed up. But we got nothing! Our bill came we waited for it for 20 minutes! and they even charged us an 18 tip for our large party. Again, we brought the manager over to tell him our concerns. The manager still didn't say one word after he heard our complaints, all we got was a head nod. One of my friends piped up and said that we should, at the very least, not pay for the 2 appetizers that we got. The manager nodded his head and I heard him say the first words to us of the night. His response was ""Fair enough "". Again, no sorry or ""I'm sorry you feel that way "". Never, ever will I eat here again.",1
"Went on a groupon 20 for 10 deal, I was disappointed even having spent 10. Ordered a burger and salad. Menu stated ""mixed greens, red onions, carrots, tomato, cheddar cheese, wonton strips "", I received a handful of iceberg lettuce, a tiny bit of grated cheese, and an under ripe tomato no carrots, onion, wonton strips etc. Salad came in a styrofoam container with a plastic fork, even though we dined in I don't expect fine china, but you can't do any better than styrofoam? n nI didn't have huge expectations, burger was decent, on par with a in and out five guys but at 2X 3X the price. Manager owner? seemed to be trying, but I can't imagine this place will be long for this world.",1

"It has been 4 months since we have eaten here last and let me tell you, this is not the same place. Where to begin.We thought we had struck it rich when we arrived and there was no line and absolutely no wait. Now I know why! The food was the worst I have eaten any where on the strip. The crab legs used to be served steamed and hot, now they are on ice. The price for the buffet has jumped by ten dollars per person. I paid 122.00 for four of us. The service was sub standard at best as we had to ask for plates to be removed and drinks to be filled. I will give the waiter this the plates were going back with lots of food on them that just could not be choked down, so that added to his work load. I give this buffet a 1 star just because I can't give a zero. Shame on you Harrahs for this slop!",1
"OMG KoMex! Korean Mexican fusion? Genius! KoMex is quite a ways from my house but their food's so good I don't mind driving half way across town for it. The restaurant is a little small and the decor is just regular, but that's not important. The food is what's important. They offer chips with salsa and FRESH guacamole to snack on while you wait for your order. I'm a big fan of carne asada fries so when I tried their bulgogi fries it was just heaven on earth. It is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The bulgogi burrito is also very good but I rather prefer their fries. Every one needs to try this place, it's inexpensive and it's just really that good!",2
"A dive bar that hits all the dive bar notes inexplicable decor, cheapish drinks, hodge podge of people, and random activities going on. n nI went with a group after a show in Scottsdale and found the crowd to be welcoming. Sort of a neighborhood joint that just is. Some dudes playing chess, dollar bills taped to the wall, a surfboard, strings of holiday lights. Come as you are. n nThe folks working the bar areas were nice and no one had to wait long for their drinks. Then again, it's not exactly craft cocktails going on here, so they're playing the quantity game. Easy enough to drop in, drop out, and spend some time with friends without too much blaring music or self described VIPs.",2
"Owner chef Joseph Keller is the co founder with his brother Thomas of Napa Valley's Buchon. His brother also operates the highly acclaimed French Laundry, Buchon at the Venetian and Per Se. Based on this dining experience, Joseph apparently is the less talented of Mrs. Keller's sons. Our meal started off with a white bean, anchovy, garlic and EVO spread delivered to our table with hot rolls. My wife opted for the crispy skin salmon served with cippolini onions, Peruvian potatoes, kalamata and asparagus tips in a sundried tomatoes tapenade. I chose the roasted chicken over garlic spinach accompanied by Joseph's signature French fries. I believe Heidi, the Review Journal's restaurant reviewer, must have based her rating on these fries because we found both entrees to be unremarkable.",1
"Stayed in the Carnaval Tower this past weekend May 24 May 25 . I think this hotel should just be torn down . The room had no drinking water and all calls requesting for water were first bounced around different places yeah . I did dial room service and was then told there was a charge associated if we wanted to get water delivered. I am not against tipping the folks who deliver stuff to the room, but this is atrocious. n nIf this was not enough, the cleaning lady was probably running short on towels and bath soaps. We had 1 towel and 1 bath soap in a room which had 2 Queen sized beds in it. n nTake my advice.Run far far away from this place as you can. This is one of those places on the strip that should just be torn down and make way for better ones.Never ever am I going to stay at this dirty excuse for a hotel.",1

Drinks were STRONG from the bar despite the fact I used free coupons , and I found the bartenders to be friendly. Clientele was typical ""I'm from LA please come up to my hotel room "" douche bag types. but whtaever, that's how clubbing in Vegas is. n nIn closing, I don't even like nightclubs, but this one seemed decent. I've only been to 3 clubs now, but so far the ranking is Tryst, then Jet, then Lavo is a distant 3rd.",2
"Worst ""Japanese "" food experience I've ever had in the Phoenix Scottsdale area! n nI've always wanted to try this place out since I've been to nearby establishments AZ 88, Pepin's, Mondrian . It looks really trendy from the inside and out. The banner outside looks like they offer a promising happy hour as well. n nWhen we walked in, we received great service from the hosts. The restaurant was fairly empty since we were there for dinner on the 4th of July. When they showed us to our table, I had to wash my hands, and by the time I came back to the table, there was already a small glass of ice water waiting for me. n nI really wanted to try their sashimi despite their high prices, but when I asked the server if they had a smaller sashimi plate to have as an appetizer, her response was to look ovey my shoulder at the menu, and say ""uhhhhh. "" I was with someone who didn't eat sashimi, so the big sashimi plate would be too large for me. It would have been nice if 1 she knew what was offered in the restaurant and 2 she could have offered a suggestion. n nWe decided to order edamame, the potato spicy tuna roll, and an avocado roll to start. Edamame and avocado rolls are ubiquitous to most sushi places, so I am going to skip the review on those items. We were both really excited for the spicy tuna roll because it sounded really creative and different. Presentation was awesome but it did not help offset the taste of the roll. I was so disappointed when I tried a piece of the roll. The sweet chili sauce they drizzled over the roll was definitely sweet chili sauce straight out of a bottle. For example, http www.mondofood.com images Thai 20Sweet 20Chili 20Sauce.JPG . I know this because I used to work at a restaurant that used to send the stuff out with their spring rolls. They seriously pulled sauce right out of the bottle!? In my opinion, the only bottled sauce any sushi restaurant should use is Sriracha. n nI was starting to get nervous for our entrees. I ordered the baked Chilean sea bass, and my friend got the flash grilled Chinese chicken salad. Again, the presentation of both items was beautiful and showed creativity, and again, the taste of the items was beyond bad. I ended up sending my food back, and was so disappointed that I couldn't order anything else. I believe there were two sauces on my plate. One I believe was a lemongrass soy and that was okay, but there was something that tasted and looked like an aioli. It actually tasted like spoiled ranch. My friend was also unimpressed by his salad, but continued to eat it anyway bad idea we had to stop halfway home for him to run into a restroom. n nThe waitress took my meal off the tab, and we were pretty impressed by the customer service. The taste and quality of the food, however, were so bad that I will not be able to return to this place.",1
"There is no drive through at this location and surrounding it are a ton of business centers so it's super busy. When I walked in, the line was out the door but I was desperate so I waited. To my surprised delight, the line went super fast and I didn't wait more than 5 minutes for my drink after ordering. I was very impressed!",2
"This is the sister restaurant of L'Alba Dora next door. I would highly recommend the ciabattas, especially the chicken pesto and mozzarella and tomato ones as they really are delicious! My friend has tried the pizzas and pastas which also look good and are a nice size for lunchtime eating not too big! n nI often go there on a lunchtime at work as a treat. It can be a bit of a wait for your lunch but they do have an advance online ordering system, so if you were in a rush you can place your order online and come in and pick it up when ready, so I must do that next time. n nI like the decor, and it's a nice place to sit in the window and people watch at thew busy street outside. n nThey have a take away menu now in conjuction with l'Alba dora so i'm going to try that next! n nLovely stuff!",2
"I have been to this sorry establishment and swore never to come back. Sadly I broke my promise and came back. My wife was very hungry and I was thinking of a different restaurant but ended up coming here. From the point of entering the restaurant I should have left. It smelled sour as if someone used a sour wash cloth and wiped down the entire place. It couldn't have been that it must have been something else like a wet moldy carpet. I mentioned it to my wife and she said well were here now. I think she was too hungry but she proceded to complain about it right up till the food being delivered. I ordered corned beef hash and eggs. The eggs were cold. The corn beef has was not cooked and cold. Presentation was horrible. I looked at it and seen how it was undercooked from a can and dumped into my plate and lost my appetitie. My wife ate half her food and I never touched mine. 16 for Eggs benedict that was made from a can, rancid coffee, sour smell to entire room, undercooked cold food. I will not be back. If I do come back I have no one else to blame.",1
"Hash House A Go Go was another restaurant my sister really liked, but she had tried the one in San Diego. Being buffeted out, we wanted to grab breakfast somewhere different, the mister and I decided to try Hash House A Go Go. They have several locations in Vegas, but we decided on the one on Sahara since it got the better reviews. n nThis location is a few miles away from the strip, but the place was packed on Sunday at 9 30A with both locals and Californians. Must be a good sign. n nOur party was 4 a baby, so 5 in total. They said that it would take about 20 25 minutes and I was prepared to wait, but the mister was antsy and wasn't really feeling the wait. He was set to leave, when low and behold, they called our name. That was only about 10 minutes. It was our lucky day! The food gods wanted us to try the joint. n nWe were seated at the booth, which fit the carseat w my baby, me, and the mister on one side and the in laws on the other side. n nLooking over the menu, there were some very interesting selections. Although I knew I should try the hash since it is part of their name, I went with the Snickers Flapjacks.I've never seen that as a pancake choice before. The mister ended up getting the chicken hash w asparagus and the in laws shared the salmon hash. I order my mister the watermelon kiwi lemonade. According to the waitress, it was the most popular non alcoholic drink. n nOur food arrived pretty quickly and our waitress was friendly and checked on us frequently. My flapjack was HUGE! It was very yummy. The Snickers were melted throughout the pancake, it was better than a chocolate chip pancake and it wasn't too sweet either. My mister's chicken hash tasted very fresh.much better tasting than the hash at Hash at the Hotel Erwin in Venice. The salmon hash was pretty good too. Even the watermelon kiwi lemonade was awesome. The drink is in three layers.top layer is the kiwi, middle is the lemonade, and the bottom is the watermelon. Very creative and so refreshing! n nI was impressed with Hash House A Go Go. Yes, I am a fan!",2
"I've been on a quest for a solid sports bar for a while now, and I have to say that the Tavern is my fav so far. Their menu is quite diverse for a sports bar. The Ahi Salad and the Miso Salmon are two gems on the menu, and I was shocked when I tried those dishes and they were phenominal as far as bar food goes . n nAlso, their Bruchetta is delish. I know everyone always talks about the bruchetta at Postinos, but in my opinion Arcadia Tavern makes a heartier and tastier board. The spinach artichoke bruchetta is so yummy, and during the week you can get a board of bruchetta and bottle of wine for only 20 Now take that Postinos! n nThe bartenders, servers manager all embody great customer service. This past weekend I wanted to watch some football and sport my 49ers Montana throw back Jersey of course , and the manager was totally accommodating when we specified that the Niners vs. Sea Chickens game was our must watch for the afternoon. He was so helpful and friendly, and seated us right next to some fellow Niners fans. Many times I'll go into sports bars and they just can't accomodiate my sports tv requests, but at the Tavern I've never had a problem! n nI'd recommend the Tavern to anyone and everyone! It's a great gathering spot for friends, and they also have fun nightly specials. I mean who doesn't like a good round of Gold Fish Racing! FYI Gold Fish Racing is held every Thursday night, and if you haven't experienced this then you should. It's pretty silly fun! ",2
"This is by far the worst experience I had at a club in Vegas. We booked a 5,000 minimum table and the Hostess and the bus boy were just plain rude. Not only that the type of people who go there are ghetto and obnoxious. n nPresale tickets are definitely cheaper at this club and there's a reason for that. It is because they are not selective in the crowd they bring in and this place is not classy at all. The girls and the crowd at this club were all ugly as hell. n nWe went to XS the next day and met some Vegas locals that just came from Hakkasan. They told us ""the crowd was so ghetto that we had to leave and come here. "" Now I only booked a cabana at XS but the service and the people were 10000000x better than hakkasan was. n nTo be honest I only went to Hakkasan because I never been but if your thinking the same thing. Trust me its not worth it. Your gonna be in there packed like sardines with ugly smelly people. If you wanna fish can it then this might be the place for you but its definitely not for me. n nI also forgot to mention why I decided to actually create a yelp account to write this review. Not only did I book that 5,000 dollar minimum table our group also got kicked out from it as well. n nSome passerby er in the club decided to walk by and throw up in front of our table. The bus boy blamed it on our group and kicked us all out. When I asked him which one of us did you see do it he said that he didn't know but it had to be ours because it was in front of our table. No one in my group was even drunk yet and I would know if it was someone from our that threw up. It definitely was not us and the bus boy didn't even know who it was. He merely made a judgement call based on what he saw in front of the table. I gave a 500 hand shake tip in the beginning too.",1
"Amazing food at large portions. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for. Pretty much whatever you get will be good. They have the best breakfast burrito I have ever had!",2
"Came here over the weekend. The food was OK but IMO 15 20 is a little pricey for a deli sandwich, but they certainly do give you a very, very large portion. We also had an order of sausages that were way too oily And I ain't afraid of grease in my food . The thing that left me with a bad taste in my mouth was the service which was possibly the worst experience I've ever had in my many trips to Las Vegas. First it took the waitress forever to get our drinks and to take our order, then when the sandwich came out it almost slipped off our plate and the waitress palmed it with her probably dirty bare hand to stop it. We should have asked for another sandwich because that's gross even the workers in Ghetto Banh Mi shops in Westminster use gloves to touch the sandwiches but we were hungry so we didn't want to wait. I had to ask for refills several times as they never really came by to check up on us and it took them forever to bring us our check. Yeah I understand that they were busy and probably one of their servers called out or something but it shouldn't take 15 minutes for them to bring us our check. We weren't the only ones waiting for our check, there was at least two other tables I saw in our immediate area waiting to pay. The worst part was there were three hosts standing right next to us just chitchatting, I know that it probably isn't part of their jobs to clean tables and print out checks, but they should be helping the servers rather than just doing nothing. it just gives a very bad perception to customers. While the food was okay I will not be coming back because of their lousy service. No I did not tip and BTW they also have a 3 sharing fee. REALLY?",1
"Half of a star because this hotel is a dump. Half of a star because the hotel rooms come with that Hooter's orange colored lampshades, and that is kinda cool. Another star because I looked down from our window and saw that the hotel's pool had a waterfall and a big sandbox area. HAHA. n nPart of me wants to give this place the benefit of the doubt because we did, in fact, cram 12 people into one standard hotel room. That's right, 4 people in the two beds, 8 people on the floor. The second night, two of our friends got a seperate room and said it was a million times better and cleaner. It might have been the lack of 10 other smelly drunk people around. n nThe room n The toilet broke the very first time it was used. n n On the back of our door, written in permanent marker read ""I'M WATCHING YOU "" uh. n n Mysterious basketball sized red stain in the corner of the room. n n They actually have a little ad thing on the dresser between the beds that starts out in big print, ""Do you REALLY need clean sheets.? "" followed by a description about how you shouldn't request to have clean sheets unless you really, really need them. As if any hotel's sheets aren't disgusting and questionable enough, the classy establishment that is Hooters is asking me to drunkenly pass out on some previously sexed up vomit bed? Pass. I ended up doing it anyway n n NO HOOTERS STATIONARY. Wtf am I supposed to steal for a souvenier? I just want a Hooters pen, god. n nThe actual hotel n The elevator is the scariest elevator I've ever been on. And smells of burning rubber. And sounds like you're about to die. Squeeling elevator noises and shaking bad. n n I got so lost just trying to get the fuck out of there and onto the strip. n n I didn't eat at the restaurant, but some of our friends did and said it was disgusting coming from growing young dudes who will eat anything n n The Hooters girls don't have hooters. I'm a girl and even I was a little appauled by this. They're just right outta high school uggos that need a job. Lame. Have some dignity and get a boob job. n n Really creepy old men everywhere. Like, EVERYWHERE. n nSo yeah. No thanks, Hooters. No thanks.",1
Was a little tricky to find the store but I'm glad I did the people working there did there job they greeted me and asked if I needed help.

"Tried Daphne's today for the first time. It will most certainly be my last, as well. n I called in an order for the fire roasted vegetable classic pita. I'm lucky I got it as a combo with rice pilaf don't think it can even be considered a pilaf bland because they literally just put LETTUCE AND TOMATO in my pita. No roasted vegetables, no hummus, no avocado nothing. Are you serious? Why have a vegetarian option if you get so confused about it? n nWhen I called them to tell them they missed the 'fire roasted vegetable part' they told me I can drive back through Scottsdale traffic and get them presuming I'd drive back to work and put them on my pita . Thanks, but no thanks. n n 8 down the drain.",1
"The food was OK but the staff were unprofessional. One of the hostesses wore a very tight and low cut dress. For a minute I thought we were at a gentleman's club. The hostess placed our menus on a table on the patio. While we were walking to our table, the manager approached us and said ""you have to go through the front entrance, "" as if we sneaked in. He didn't care that one of us was disabled, with a cane. It took almost 20 minutes for our server to come to take our drink order. Someone from our group asked for no tomato and no onion on her wrap. too bad we couldn't find our server to correct the order because he was MIA. Lastly, the food wasn't flavorful. The shawarma was bland and sauceless. If you are into trendy places with snooty clientele and mediocre food, you will love this place. I've been to the Pita Jungle in Scottsdale and Tempe and had very pleasant experiences at both.",1
"I'm totally new to Vegas and it was 1 30 am. I hadn't had anything to eat all day so I wanted pizza to fill me up. Called to place an order but didn't have a menu. Cell phone dropped call. Called again. Drove to pickup the pizza and went to the wrong place. Called again. And then I told them it was the web's fault. Opps, it was my bad after all. These guys are so patient. Not a sarcastic tone or anything. Really pleasant to talk to. n nAnd then the pizza. I cannot ever make up my mind so I ordered two. Can always put it in the fridge or freezer for other times. Had a piece of each. The spinach with feta, mushrooms, cheese and garlic butter sauce was heavenly and the meatball and mushroom pizza with marinara was to die for. Both pies had just the right amount of each ingredient. The crust was the perfect balance of crisp and dough. n nIt may not be the closest pizza joint to where I live, but they have my business no matter what the hour.",2

"Quick summary the BEST animal hospital I have found in the Vegas Valley have been to several . They honestly care and show compassion to all members of your family including those that have fur and stand on four legs. Highly recommend them! n nIn depth review Dr Snead is our main contact at the animal hospital. He is a kind and caring doctor. I have never felt rushed or like he is putting profit before the animal or our own well being. He is always on point and has made visiting this animal hospital much easier. Has often sent us home with meds at no cost and waived fees. The facility is clean and immaculate. n nAbout a year ago we had the horrible experience of having two older male cats both come down with two serious cases of cancer within months of each other. Was a difficult time. Dr Snead did EVERYTHING that he could do to try to save them. Including overnighting one of them for weeks at no cost while administering care. When it became apparent we had to let them go, he made it as comforting as possible. He remained with us and I knew that he was feeling our pain could see it in his face. Honestly not sure if we would have been able to make it through the situation w o him helping us or standing by our side. He was amazing! n nDr Snead has that ""it "" factor hat makes him a great doctor. The animals also seem to connect with him and the staff. Have seen them calm right down when he or his staff handle them. n nWe now have new furry creatures in our family and we still continue to bring them to Sunridge. Would like to thank the entire staff and Dr Snead for being amazing people. Please keep up the good work we appreciate it!",2

"After doing my research I found that this hotel only had 2 1 2 stars. That was a red flag for me but since my family had already booked a room I wanted to be with them. nSo, I took a chance and booked mine through the Rivieras web site. Come out to be right around 400.00 for 4 nights 2 of which were weekdays . nI can tell you this place was a seedy, ghetto, trashy, dirty, smelly, place. The staff was very rude and unfriendly. When we tried to call the front desk, they would not answer which really put us in a predicament. The front desk was at least 1 4 mile from the room and the car was twice as far no kidding! The walls are paper thin, the carpet is absolutely gross. Water stains and others on walls and ceilings, the beds were 2 doubles which is not much bigger than a single, they were so uncomfortable I felt like I was sleeping at a lumpy angle, my head tilted down towards the head board. I woke up several times to a neck and back ache, the noise, the bright lights from the outside felt like the sun was always out. The casino was just as raunchy. My sister bought a draft beer which cost 7.75. nThe bathrooms had no vent at all, it was nasty as everything else. We were too far for the free wi fi it never worked the entire time. I can not think of one positive thing to say about this place. The tv partially worked but not great. nNo freebies, no continental breakfast, the coffee was 2.80 per small cup. etc, etc. nI have never stayed in a place where I felt so insecure about my property and safety. nI will not go into the noisy neighbors that threatened me at 4 am when I asked them to keep it down.",1
"went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called ""lobster tails "" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore.",1
"Everything was fairly yummy. I wonder if it's a LITTLE bit overpriced though. I paid 43 for a salad, a rice bowl, and 3 paninis. The Paninis are kinda on the small side, but the flavors really POP and the food is definitely fresh. n nThe paninis were better on the morning after, having the leftovers. Heated it in the micro for 30 seconds and it really brought all the flavors out better than eating the other half on the first day did. n nI'd skip the rice bowls though. Nothing wowed us about that dish. n nLucky for me they are in my neighborhood, so I'll give them another visit soon.",2
"Stay FAR AWAY from this place, the staff is horrible. They don't know the hotels on the strip, let alone their own menu. Then, they said they were going to run my card and call me back in 5 to confirm, then dial tone.

good sushi in downtown.living in downtown over the past 15 years it almost sounded too good to be true to not have to drive to get decent sushi.

"My friends and I just left the Phoenix Open and after a long day of walking all we were looking forward to was sitting down for some food and cold drinks. We hadn't planned on that taking an hour and a half so that was really unfortunate. n nWhen we came in we decided to sit at a booth because it was pretty chilly out. It wasn't too busy, but we only counted 3 servers. I think that was what caused the majority of our problems. n nIt took our waitress like 10 minutes before she came over to greet us with our bottle of water and glasses. Because it took a while for her to came over we ordered drinks and chips and salsa. Drinks took another 15 minutes so by the time they came we had already finished with our chips and were so hungry we almost ate the paper. n nTwo of our friends ordered the tacos which they said were decent. I ordered the tinga burrito bowl. Luckily the meat was good because the black eyed peas were an awkward addition and the rice was hard. My other friend ordered the nachos with no meat which also had the strange black eyed peas and some cheese sprinkled on them. So unfortunate the food was a flop. Bland. n nShe didn't come back to check on us very often and we noticed two other tables complaining from the same issue, different server. Seems like they were understaffed and it impacted the service in a BAD way. n nIt's unfortunate we didn't like it here because we were excited about the new location and the cool new look. We left saying we wouldn't come back. Hopefully after a while of being back up and running they will get things going a bit better, I'm not opposed to giving it another shot.",1
"I really wanted to enjoy my experience at Indulge, but didn't. From the website, local magazine reviews, and driving by, I expected it to be a slightly upscale neighborhood joint, but it really is no different than a Fuddruckers. nWe were underwhelmed by the food and hated the environment. Two of us built our own burgers, and one ordered a pre made pick off the menu. We had the dill chips fried pickles as an appetizer. I can't say that any of us loved our meal, and as soon as we walked out we all agreed we weren't interested in going back. It was just no better than you could make at home and I burn soup . nThe tables were crowded, too close together, and the place was uncomfortably noisy. Our servers were trying to clear plates as soon as one of us set down a fork no one was waiting for our table , and asked for our dessert orders while we were still eating. nThe whole experience was rushed, loud, uncomfortable, and not ""indulging "" in any way. I'm so disappointed.",1
"Made out to Phoenix again last month and again, managed to hit up Los Taquitos on our last day there. This time I had a shredded beef chimichanga, and of the three I had while in town also went to Valle Luna and Filibertos , it was the best.

The young lady at the counter was friendly and helpful. n nI have to get my fill of chimichangas when I am in Arizona because here in Texas, they tend to put all sorts of stuff in them and smother everything in queso and red sauce. i also have to get my fill of green sauce because what we have here isn't as good. What impressed me is that when I bought some green sauce to bring back, both the young lady who took my order plus the lady who was on the Triple D program took the time to make sure that what I bought would retain its freshness and how to properly freeze then bring to a boil before cooling it to store what might be left over after a week.

"Items Ordered nGrizzle Nickel Bar nChocolate Chip Cookie nMolasses Cookie nChocolate Whoopie Pie nApple Coffee Cake n nPromoting a natural and organic approach to all of their products Layers Bakery is the sort of place anyone with a substantial sweet tooth should really want to like, but with a first visit to the flagship proving rather underwhelming it was almost a year later that a trip to the smaller storefront on Medical Center Street finally took place the results equally unimpressive as a stripped down selection due to ""lack of demand "" yielded only one memorable item out of an order of five. n nPerhaps one third the size of the original, tucked away next to the Hospital just off the 215, it was admittedly a trip to the nearby FedEx that took me to the smaller Layers and although service first chastised me for taking pictures, the young woman eventually lightened up and filled the order, all items wrapped in paper and placed in a pair of bags at a total of 17 as the rest of the staff stood in the kitchen without a single person to serve in the caf u00e9. n nOpting to take goods elsewhere to enjoy alongside coffee it was in the bakeless ""Grizzle Nickel "" bar that I first partook and although interestingly textured with graham, coconut, chocolate chips, and peanuts all competing for palate space the flavor was largely that of the bittersweet chocolate that dominated, a flavor I'd find far more subdued in a chocolate chip cookie that was quite decent, though nothing the average baker couldn't make just as well at home. n nMore impressed by a molasses cookie that featured a far bolder spice profile than most restaurants or bakeries would be willing trot out while the coffee cake proved too dry in areas not in direct contact with the admittedly delicious apples, it was after more coffee that the refrigerated whoopie pie was explored but despite having allowed it about an hour to warm up the now room temperature palm sized disc still proved far too 'cakey' while the filling was pasty and thick, not smooth and creamy like several experienced in the past. n nGiving them credit for trying to do what is right it can only be said that Layers simply does not execute as well as other bakeries speckled across the valley and with none of their cakes offered at this location while only one is cut daily at the Henderson flagship I simply cannot justify recommending them to anyone, there are simply better options to be had.",1
2 stars for the nice clothes. Paul Smith makes good stuff if you can get it on sale not worth normal retail though . n nService isn't great though. Very pushy and want to get you to walk out with a lot of clothes. Sold me a suit that didn't fit well with the promise that Paul Smith San Francisco would alter it for free. SF said that was ridiculous and upon going to a tailor they said the type of alteration it needed wasn't even possible. Kind of sucks because I now have a 1500 suit that doesn't really fit.,1
"Really good. The chili Verde burrito was super. Carne asada burrito was awesome. Our server Adrian was fun and had great suggestions. If you are looking for good Mexican food in Scottsdale, this is the joint.",2
"Honestly, every time I eat at Rose Tea Cafe, I'm happy. They give rather large portions and are really authentic as I heard from my Taiwanese friends. Though the prices are a bit steep, especially for bubble tea back in NY you can get it for much cheaper . However, their bubble tea is probably the best in Pittsburgh, at least of all the ones I had so far.",2
"Im Rahmen einer Veranstaltung war ich erneut im Badisch Brauhaus. Mein erster Besuch hier ist schon drei Jahre her. Damals u00fcbernachtete ich Traumhotel.

"This is the best restaurant experience you will ever have. The food, the atmosphere, the service is the best in the West.

"I had high hopes Taj Palace but should have known that this place is destined to be another flop in the bucket of sub par Indian restaurants in Las Vegas. My family and I had dinner here last night. We ordered several different naans, rotis, and kulchas. The naans were undercooked and you could pull at the doughy centers. The rotis were too thick and you couldn't tell them apart from the naan. We ordered chicken kadai and butter chicken. Both dishes are rich but the oil floating on top of the chicken kadai was just gross. The chicken pieces in the murgh makani butter chicken were strange bits with tiny bones. I was hoping for good quality white chicken breast. We also ordered a shrimp dish but all you could taste was the tomato base. It lacked the spicy kick we were looking forward to. On the other hand, the servers were very polite and friendly. The ambiance could use improvement. I'm all about energy efficient lighting, but the white lights gave the place a cafeteria like feel. nHow much longer do we have to wait before we can get the quality Indian food of cities like Chicago, NY and LA?",1
The food is excellent and the service is great. Very homey and warm environment. The beef stroganoff is the best! Cheesecake is a must as well. Will go back again!,2
"The line was fairly long, but it went fast. Don't let it deter you. n nThe menu had me stuck in ""decision mode "" for a solid 20 minutes because they had so many delicious sounding choices all for either 6 or 6.49, which is a great deal in Vegas . n nI eventually chose something with chicken and avocado and some other stuff I don't really remember because I am was probably drunk at the time . n nThe sandwich was a LITTLE small, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Plus, the chicken tasted a little bit like those rubber cubes from Scrubway. But comparing those two, this easily blew it out of the water. n nThe bread gave me an erection. Which was crazy because I for sure thought I had whiskey dick by this point. Nope.",2

"Seriously, yelpers, how does this place have such a high rating? Bland, boring, blah three words for the Murray Ave Grill. n nOn a positive note, if you're big into 80's one hit wonders, this establishment plays 'em all. n nService was okay, but not great. The menu was unnecessarily difficult to navigate. Salad was okay, nothing special two olives and two cherry tomatoes , but at least it was field greens and not just iceberg lettuce. n nMy dining companion's fish special was swimming in butter and had bones all through it, and my crab cakes were greasy and bland. I had to salt everything to even get an ounce of flavor out of it. n nThis was my first trip to Murray Ave Grill, and I have a strong suspicion it will also be my last. I'm hardly sad about that.",1
"When I began wedding planning 13 months before our nuptials, the goal to create a unique party atmosphere, resembling that of a club. What I thought I had invented music video backdrops and state of the art lighting effects we found in The Beat Booth. nMy husband and I met Erica and Nathan at a bridal show, and immediately joined in my excitement for a techno version of ""Hava Nagila "" for our Jewish Hora and obsessive amounts of Britney Spears tracks which I wanted played every 5 songs, so that I could just stare at the screen and oogle . nOnce we had decided that they fit the vision for our Desert Botanical Garden winter wedding, they were flexible with our budget to provide us the extensive equipment needed for an event of 250. Additionally, they were prompt in responding to emails and met with us several times to go over specific details including at our venue, where they took copious notes. nThey went over the top to help us save, by providing microphones for our service, speakers for our cocktail hour, speaking with our event coordinator for our venue to link the projector, and connecting my husband's keyboard to their system for a very special performance of his vows that he wrote in a song. nThe aspects that we would have changed worthy of 5 stars were probably unnoticed by the guests. We were specific about our expectations going into coordinating, and it seemed that Nathan and Erica had full understanding and we trusted they would match the types of music suggested. My husband provided Nathan with independent music for our cocktail hour and dinner, none of which was mainstream to the point of hearing on the radio, however, during dinner, I did hear some Top 40 songs. In watching our wedding footage, we recognized that some of the older music to open the dance floor was cheesy i.e. ""Oh, What a Night, "" and ""Twist and Shout "", when we would have preferred more Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Lionel Richie . Our middle aged guests looked to be enjoying themselves, and we may have been more specific with our expectations when talking about what we did not want. Additionally, a country song was played as a slow dance this did not fit our demographic that well, as our families are from Boston and Minnesota. Lastly, when we were introduced to dance our choreographed song as husband and wife, the wrong Jason Mraz song was cued. Nathan and Erica both apologized and amended the situation quickly. Our large crowd required more assurance from our VJ with making announcements and maintaining time specifications, for example, no one was aware the we were cutting the cake as it was not presented in the most assertive manner possible. nOur guests had much positive feedback and stayed later than we would have projected of a Sunday night wedding, and I wholeheartedly believe this was related to our unmatched entertainment. My biggest regret was that because we were running behind with speeches and dinner. we didn't have more time to dance and party with our guests!",2
Ugliest building in Edinburgh. I don't think people will ever stop talking about how much it cost. n Poor old Lizzie having that accross from her little pad in Edinburgh. If terrorists went for the place she would probably enoble them.,1
Maybe Im way too pickey since I really havnt had a of good things to say about most of the places Ive been. This place is no different! We went there and the food was over cooked or had been sitting out for way tooo long. I see that it shut down for a while then opened back up under the same name. I will give it a try again to see if the new owners care a little more about the product than the last.,1

The pollo fundido was very yummy. For this price point it exceeded my expectations. Although exterior bathroom was inconvenient.,2
Can't get chicken strips anywhere else. Fast fresh and fantastic.,2
"Want to try a new place to have a decent burrito. After watching them make the burrito, I headed for Roberto's. Disappointed with the pre cooked meat just sitting on the counter drying out. Made to order just taste so much better, but I will go back and try the taco's. The meat cooking on that vertical grill looks good but the burrito's need to change NOW.",1
"We already had the car diagnosed from another mechanic, but they were all the way in Gilbert. So, we looked up to find another nearby and found C R. We made an appointment and told them what needed to be fixed. They told us that the previous mechanic didn't know what he was talking about and said they'd take care of it. LONG story short, they finally did what we had originally told them to do on the THIRD time bringing the car in. Total scam. I would never recommend this place to anyone and have filed a formal complaint.",1
"Probably my best meal in Vegas. Simple, creative unique food made from fresh ingredients. The prices are pretty reasonable.

"Burger overcooked, fries undercooked, if you are only doing burgers and fries it needs to be a lot better. Very annoying that you cannot get a glass of water. I liked the theme, the staff is friendly and cute in their uniforms. One time trip for me, I will not go back or recommend. There are too many good burger joints to choose from.",1
"Disappointing the service is slow, the staff, indifferent. You can see the kitchen from some of the tables, and they were not happy when a kids burger was sent back raw. The fries were bland, the burgers, sad. Overall save your money. its not worth it.",1
"Very disappointed with my experience. Id stay away from these guys. The owner is very unprofessional.

Ok so I live right down the street and I would say I've been to a fair amount of bars and restaurants and clubs being 21 anyways I always would drive by this place and always wanted to give it a try I'm a sporty kind of girl so a co worked said augies was awesome so we went we had drinks till they closed I order a margarita it was awesome they add orange juice which is supper good and they were giving out prizes for doing shots I declined lol but I order the mozzeralla sticks they were bomb.com they were so good they were wrapped in a egg roll it was different but really good service and staff were awesome fast the bar was clean there were families singles couples and even some senior citizens so I loved it so much I took my husband we sat at the bar the bartender was on it the bar was full and we were never left with an empty glass we tipped her very good one of the best bartenders I have seen with awesome service I had an pizza husband had a burger which he loved since as a man that's all he eats the place was packed but there was room at the bar I felt super comfty everyone was happy and having a good time it was a Thursday evening they had an band who played Zach brown and country favorites and other bar favorites they were awesome wish we could o stayed longer . Also if u really think ur gunna be able to go to any bar and watch a fight for free ur crazy these other negative reviews r one of many good reviews I have gone twice and have never had bad luck same with my friends I recommend this place way better then native new yorker! Love love augies new place for drinks ,2
"Very impressive and interesting show nI was surprised they used fireworks indoors as it was so bright. nThe stage is very interesting as it constantly changes and moves around. nThe only thing I didn't really like was there was no dialogue just babbling, which seems kind of like a cop out to me, but I guess that's what they do.",2
"The food is okay for the most part, Ive only had one issue with the potato skins that came out burnt. My favorite is the Summer Salad, but Im giving them 2 Stars because every time I come here the Service is HORRIBLE. My girl friends I will end up being held hostage. Our server will always end up disappearing and not dropping off our check in a appropriate amount of time. but since I live off tips I still always tip 20 because I believe in karma. n nJust a heads up, if you decide to come here on the weekends, the food takes forever.",1

"I was a little skeptical at first because when I inquired about cleaning my 2 bedroom, 2 bath 800 SF apartment, I was told 3 girls for 2 3 hours. I thought to myself, what in the world are 3 people going to clean in this small apartment for 2 3 hours and at double what I was paying before? It's just me and my 19 year old son living here and we clean up after ourselves but I was unhappy with the cleaning service I had been using, to the extent that I missed a month if cleaning. I e mailed Amy and decided to give them a try. Two ladies showed up on time but to the wrong apartment building, TOTALLY MY FAULT! I have them my simple instructions and left them to do their job. I can back 2 hours later and my apartment smelled and looked great! I didn't realize how badly it needed cleaning since I missed last month. I am so very happy with their service and how they cleaned that I sent Amy a text and complimented the ladies on a great job and asked if they could clean every month. n nSince two ladies come, and they do an amazing job, I don't mind spending the extra money. And since it was their first service and I hadn't had the apartment cleaned last month, it was well worth it. n nThank you, Pristine Cleaning!",2
It is good place to visit if you are near to this place or if you are driving through this place.very good and peaceful location.can easily spend 1 hour of evening time here peacefully.,2

What a waste of time! n nHow do these people think they can do business with this kind of service. n nOnly buy from them if you do not anticipate needing customer service.",1
"This place is disgusting .went here starving and left starving ! Couldn't bare to eat food that looked unappetizing , we got the teriyaki bowls . Veggies were soggy and looked microwaved , they were a dull color , kinda rubbery too. Meat looked like thawed frozen chicken not fresh rice was drenched in sauce. Place was dingy inside , not very clean . I don't expect much from fast food places but when your starving and STILL can't bring yourself to eat the food that's a bad sign usually everything looks and taste better ! just gross all the way around. If you want a yummy chicken bowl go to Yogis ! They r delish and fresh ! ",1
"After ascending the stairs, one is transported into an authentic Chinese restaurant complete with plastic, white table cloths and seemingly dingy decor. The food is delicious and the service is speedy. During our visit the host was especially friendly and spoke English very well. As far as the food, the Beef Stir fry with Chinese broccoli was quite delectable as was the Steamed shrimp with garlic. However, the shrimp weren't peeled nor cleaned, something that was more an annoyance than anything. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for tasty Chinese cuisine in Montreal.",2
"Been going to the Cheesecake factory off and on for many years. I agree with other posts that the prices are too high. At the same time, the size of the servings are getting smaller. I usually order Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. The last time we went was the worst. I don't know if its the cook or they changed the recipe. Won't be returning any time soon. Service was poor and the food disappointing. Cheesecake still amazing just very expensive with smaller serving size.",1
Boardwalk Beach food. I would not let the Wolfgang Puck name on the outside trick you into thinking you are eating anything else except pool food. I've had better food at community pool clubs. nThey were nice enough to make me a ceasar salad wrap since there were not many vegetarian options so that was a bonus but it was not good. It was the most overpriced for mediocre food I encountered in Vegas. Next time I'd head inside to Canyon ranch instead.,1
"Spot on for fabulous food, trendy drinks and excellent service. I will b back for sure. The menu is creative, the service from Dorian our waiter was super. The manager came to check on everything and everyone made sure it was a good dining experience. This chain is expanding for good reason. Southern food with fresh flavor. My Southern mom would approve.",2
"Today was my second and very last visit to this store. The owner should be ashamed for the absolute lack of customer service that I have experienced. Upon entering the store I was utterly ignored and was never asked once if I would like a fitting room, even after loading up with 6 items to try on. Once in the tiny fitting room with no mirror I could tell that each piece was too horrendous looking to even leave to look at in a mirror. I walked back out of the store with no word from the sales staff whatsoever yet again. This is a pitiful shop in Dilworth, not Armani so I expect not to be ignored by erroneously posh sales girls. What a tragedy.",1
"The room and staff were great. Great room, clean and up to date. The restaurant there is anything but good. It is mediocre at best and very overpriced. I got a Ruben sandwhich which I had to spit out seriously. It was thick meat and undercooked and grizzly. Awful. I have no taste of Russian dressing. Room great. Food is horrid.",1
"I just got a new muffler on my 2000 Honda Civic. Overall, I had a good experience. They were fast and friendly but I felt it was a little more expensive than the other reviewers lead you to think. I spent 312 on a new pipe and muffler which came with a 1 year warranty. All around a pretty good deal at a reasonable price but not a crazy cheap deal by any means.",2
"I recently found myself facing a birthday milestone of sorts, so like any level headed person, I chose escapism to avoid any office brouhahas and off key singing. By pure happenstance, I wound up at this InterContinental it was part of an Expedia package , but let me tell you it was a week of pure heaven. First of all, you're just steps from Old Town, so surrounded by breathtaking architecture. It's conveniently Metro adjacent, flawlessly decorated, and staffed with service oriented professionals who spoil you rotten. I literally wanted to have my bed, park view, and luxurious bathroom shipped home with me. While this hotel stay was not of my choosing when I booked my trip, you can rest assured I'll now be purposely staying at this chain again and again.",2
"Blah, I really liked boardwalk billy's in university so we decided to stop here for lunch this weekend. The menu had very few choices. It was either go with the seafood platter, a burger, or a wrap.

"This is where you come to catch a disease. n nI come here only for the deep fried oreos, and candy bars. Im a sucker for deep fried anything. Although their bad for you I could care less, its vegas, its once in a great while, you deserve to bloat! Deep fried crap place is in the very back ""Nathans "" love their food though. Also the casino frozen drinks are the cheapest here. 1 more an extra shot works for me. n nGet past the old slot machines, granny's in wheel chairs, and sketchy people that look like they are gona rob you and lick the walls after, its not a bad place to get some yummy treats.",1
"We ate there today because we had an Entertainment Book coupon. Would never have even seen the place otherwise. The only negative is that it was hot inside, but that was OK, since it was a beautiful day and we ate outside. n nOne of the employees asked me if we had been there before, since I'm sure we don't look like regulars. I had the fish burrito and my husband had the chicken burrito. Definitely plenty of food. They gave us complimentary chips and told us to ask if we wanted any more. One of the employees came outside to see how we liked everything. The quality of the food at such a reasonable price is something we will remember.",2
I went here when it was Lola and shortly after it became Citizen. They still served Lola coffee and it was just fine and dandy and I went back a few times. I'm not sure what changed but we ordered a Blanco or whatever they call it and a Hive on 4 30. The Blanco tasted like a slightly sweetened drip coffee. Or like they were pulling all four shots from the same pod. I make espresso's at home and this was a very similar taste to when you run a pod multiple times. I hate giving bad reviews but I feel like this should be noted. I was crunched for time that morning. If I weren't I would have turned around and returned the coffee I have only done that once in my life .,1
"went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door.then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that. i just didn't care for how slow they were.",1
"Since we sat in the Vino Lounge for our UYE last night, I guess it's appropriate that I post my review here n nIt was kind of a quiet Sunday evening, but it was the perfect place to chill with a group of people. The breeze on the patio was refreshing and like Kristin said, they did a good job with the decor with the white linen curtains shielding you from a view of the parking lot. n nJanuary, our server, was extremely outgoing and sweet. I had several glasses of the Sauv Blanc which was light, crisp, and fresh the ideal beverage for the warm evening we had! It went well with the food I tasted as well. I tried the petite lobster corn dogs how can you not order those?! the handcut pomme frites dusted with indian curry and murray river saltl short rib, seared scallops with yellow curry foam and mango caviar roasted baby artichokes with brown butter and fifty year old spanish sherry and wild mushrooms with cognac and chervil. My bf had all of those as well as the cheese plate. We enjoyed everything we had, even though the servings were pretty small. I expected the items that were on the dinner menu to be larger portion sizes, but everything was on the small side, so be prepared! n nThe menu items we ordered added up and got a little bit pricey, but it was a fun evening, so it was worth it! Thanks again to all of you who came to hang. we'll have to do it again soon!",2
"AYCE Lunch 11 30am 3pm 20.95 nAYCE dinner 3pm midnight 24.95 nNo time limit n nThis place has by far has the best fish to rice ratio we've seen at a Las Vegas AYCE establishment as of yet! The rumors are true, they are a ""Korean "" ran sushi establishment, but don't let that sway you! I loved that they served up itty bitty rice portions with substantially thick slices of fish. They also have a decent selection on thier menu to choose from. Big plus that they also offer half sized rolls 4 pieces. To top it off they had great service they were extremely attentive and friendly from start to finish. n nFavorites nSalmon nigiri loved the thick slice of salmon. nYuzu yellowtail this was our favorite of the evening! nTamago simple and enjoyable. nSeafood salad lots of fish, and the sweet marinated cucumbers were addicting. nMiso soup great flavor and piping hot. nBaked green mussels mussels were a little dried out, but great sauce and overall flavor. nBaked scallop roll half order simple CA roll with a tasty baked scallop and mayo topping. nLemon roll half order simple CA roll with salmon and refreshing paper thin slices of lemon. nAma ebi 1 piece Per Person Dinner Only Plump and meaty. nUni 1 order Per Person Dinner Only sweet and fresh. nSalmon belly 1 order Per Person Dinner Only so incredibly buttery and sweet. nRed bean ice cream rich and creamy. n nI would stay away from nOysters It was super fishy and foul and wasn't fresh that day. nSarada lobster hmm it tasted just like imitation crab meat to me. nBacon asparagus and bacon lobster skewers 2 teeny tiniest little bits you can imagine per skewer you can only order 1 of each skewer . nGreen tea Panna cotta weak green tea flavor, not the right Panna cotta texture, more like flan. nBlack sesame blanc manger nice black sesame flavor, just not sweet enough for my liking. nGreen tea ice cream weak green tea flavor.",2
"Ate here 2 days ago with a buddy of mine. We had a pizza with sausage and ham, a meatball sub, and the fried dough for dessert. n nThe service was great, the young lady and young man were very attentive they checked up on us several times. We met Biaggio as well, he was very friendly and checked up on us also to make sure everything was cooked properly. Service was A . n nAs for the pizza.crust had nice texture. It was crisp enough on the bottom to hold up to the toppings but still soft enough in the middle to fold and provide a nice chew. You won't get the smoky slightly charred crust from a coal fired brick oven which I personally love since some yelpers have wondered about the oven , but you will get a nice thin crust pizza with a good bite to it. A previous yelper had said the cheese was too greasy, but it was fine in my opinion. Perhaps it did make a difference that he didn't have a whole fresh pie. I liked the sausage quite a bit, the ham was good but nothing special as far as I could tell. I found the sauce to have a nice flavor to it, it was fairly zesty and not too sweet like some other pizzerias. This is just MY personal preference, but I like my sauce to be slightly thicker or more paste like than the sauce on the pizza here. However, if I had to choose only one between taste or thickness I'd still choose taste. Overall, definitely one of the best pizza options in Summerlin. Plus they deliver! n n On a side note, I noticed one of the yelpers on here was talking about not being able to get delivery on football Sundays. Funny, cuz I talked to Biaggio about that when I was there. I also order pizza almost every Sunday during football season. Biaggio said he would be able to parbake the pizza and deliver it on Saturday. Since the parbaked pizza would only be half cooked, you would be able to finish the baking process on Sunday and have a fresh baked pie right out of the oven. Seems like a fair solution to the store not being open on Sundays. n nAh, the meatball sub. I have to say it's probably the best meatball sub I've had since I moved here several years ago. They get their rolls from a local bakery here in town and they make their own meatballs. Using a nice blend of beef, pork, and veal along with a healthy dose of garlic equals winning recipe for meatballs in my book! n nWhen it was time for dessert I asked about the zeppole and Biaggio explained it to me. Unfortunately he was out of the raspberry dipping sauce which he said just elevates the dessert to another level. So he recommended we try that next time when he has the sauce. Instead, he offered the fried dough which was served warm with a quick basting of butter and dusting off cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar. This was a really nice dessert, the dough wasn't too heavy and it was slightly salty and slightly sweet. We enjoyed it very much. To top it off, Biaggio gave us the dessert for free since we weren't able to have the zeppole with raspberry sauce. How nice is that? n nI was told the star item of the restaurant is the pastrami stromboli. I LOVE pastrami, so I'll definitely be going back and trying that!",2
"He says. nWe came here with high expectations after reading some of the reviews here. Ordered the Tom Kai gai, viet spring rolls, the pad Thai, pho bo, and panang curry chicken between the 2 of us. After tasting them all, I've concluded that this is the worst Thai Viet restaurant I have yet to try in the entire Las Vegas area. The pho was absolutely tasteless, almost like water and noodles, and even with some hoisin sauce it just tasted like water with noodles with hoisin sauce. The curry looked like it came out of a fast food place, the carrots and chicken were so horribly cut they look like they were made by a 5 year old, and the sauce was way too salty. The Tom Kai gai was too creamy, it was literally like coconut cream with some chicken in it. Maybe I've gone to Lotus of Siam too recently to have my tastes spoiled, but after trying 5 dishes I can safely say that I don't know what every other review says is right, perhaps it's even contrived. n nShe says. nComing from a Vietnamese gal, I really have to say the broth of the Pho was extremely tasteless. I never seen a restaurant who did not bring out the hoisin and hot sauce when serving Pho. I had to ask the servers for it and after having the sauces for 5 minutes, the servers took it back as if they only had one set. I understand that there might be a possibility that the chef forgot to add the flavors but we did not receive an apology after telling the server about the Pho. Pad Thai was the best out of all we ordered I have to say. Panang curry was wayyyy to salty. Even with the white rice didn't help hide the saltiness. Servers was very attentive, too much I say, but maybe because we were the only table there at 7 30pm on a Sunday night. I'm usually not to critical when it comes to food but I could not say anything for this restuarant. I give them a solid 2 5.",1
"Lamb chops! Big Montana Steak! Kobe Beef! Draft Beer! and Sports! what else do you want? Oh yeah. everyone is nice and friendly too. Everyone time I go, late night or for lunch, I feel like I'm right at home.",2
"The reviews for this place sounded so good and I did not realize where it was until the other night. Right across the street from the Family Dollar Store where Bistro Le Bon is. Today for lunch I did not eat it all . The small Combo platter was Chopped Pork, St. Louis Style Ribs, Sausage, Beef Brisket, Hush Puppies, Pickled Onions and two sides I chose the Jalapenos stuffed with Cheese, wrapped with bacon and BBQ Slaw. In addition I ordered Fried Pickles, Sweet Potato Fries, Brown Sugar Bacon only two slices and for Dessert the Peanut Butter Cup a minimum of 700 calories a meal in itself ! n nOne at a time Two very excellent BBQ sauces, One sweeter Tomato Based 4.5 yelp stars. The second a vinegar based sauce 4.85 stars. n nThe Meats NICE Smokey Flavor! The Beef Brisket I needed a knife and not a sharp one and only barely this brisket was Tender ! Good flavor on its own! With the vinegar very good 4 stars. St. Louis Cut Ribs 4.25 yelp stars. The Sausage was better than many and better than most I've had lately 3.25 stars. The Chopped Pork Fantastic 5 stars. The Brown Sugar Bacon 3.75 stars. n nExtras The Fried Pickles are a Winner! Thin sliced perfect batter light and Thin perfectly cooked an Easy 5 yelp stars and I ate these with no dressing! They needed nothing the flavor was perfect! Sweet Potato Fries another winner 5 yelp stars with ease. The BBQ slaw was good, no mayo, very simple, I added the vinegar BBQ sauce to it so it rates a 3.95 stars. Stuffed Jalapenos wrapped in Bacon 3.85 stars. n nThe Hush Puppies and Pickled Onions were throw away items throw them away! and NOT factored in to my review rating and that is a good thing for the restaurant! n nThe Dessert was good I ate the whole thing though I would not order it again because I'm very picky This Dessert will not make my ""Dessert "" list at 3.6 stars! Yes I took photos! Happy Dinning! n nThe Roof Top dinning area looks real cool so I'll be back for the Cuban Sandwich and see how it stacks up with Carlos Cafe.",2
"Had dinner here tonight for the first time because it was one of very few restaurants that seat after 9 30pm in Lawrenceville. The meal was excellent from start to finish. We enjoyed a delicious chickpea curry cream of mushroom soup to start. It was followed by yummy pita bread with cranberry orange butter, compliments of the chef. I ordered the Gnocchi Nirvana which was a fusion Italian Indian dish. Absolutely delicious and a welcome meal on a cold winter night. My husband ordered the Cornish Hen which he enjoyed very much. We finished with the flourless chocolate torte which was an amazing finish to a fantastic meal. Can't wait to dine here again!",2
"The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi upscale restaurants here. It's also got a really good swanky and somewhat hidden bar here. n nSo why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die. especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank. n nThe new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe that's where the term ""filthy rich "" comes from. What do these people eat?",1
"After reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to try this place today even though I had sworn off ""chop shop manicures "" and was pretty disappointed. nSeriously, Girls, 5 stars? nI had a manicure and pedicure. Neither were satisfactory. nThe people that work there seemed okay, but the stares and laughs you endure were anything but relaxing. nThe actual mani pedi was sub par, at best. nMy fingernails are all different lengths. She did an okay job with the cuticles, but nothing special. nMy feet, well, let's just say I'll be ready for a pedicure in about a week. nPersonally, I still expect the basics when going to these strip mall places nails filed to the same length, cuticles pushed back and trimmed, and feet filed or smoothed. nThe fact that someone can massage my feet and hands is unimportant to me if I can't get the basic service done properly. nSorry, but if you value the appearance of your digits, skip this place.",1
"Place is terrible. Takes 45 minutes to pick up glasses. More than 2 weeks to have glasses made. Awful customer service, was standing by the front desk for 15 minutes before being told to sit down for another half hour. Out of control. Paid nearly 400 for glasses to be treated terribly.",1
Staff is always helpful.,2
This is a great little bar lounge. I ordered a Aviator and hung out at a UYE event or could of been a CMYE event. It came in a Foo Foo Glass but i didnt feel weird drinking it. And it was quite delicious. The owner was behind the bar serving. GREAT. Little candles are lit and the stools are comfortable. Music is playing but its not over powering so you can still have a conversation. I think the prices are more Strip priced than Downtown priced but its all good. I shall be back.,2
"Probably the last time I will eat here. The food is tasty, but the portions are small compared to other hip Mexamerican spots. Prices are a bit steep, also. One would think, being a stone's throw from the busiest campus in the valley, that you'd have some less expensive menu items. n nFar and away, the most significant reason I'm not in a hurry to go back is the service. The ordering process is generally quick and easy, but every single time I eat here the person at the counter seems so put out and agitated about having to take someone's order. And not the same person either. I know people have bad days, but now it seems like a pattern. Everyone's struggling to make a buck these days, and it's that little shred of hospitality that makes the difference.",1
"I'm so relieved they have a Tea Station in Vegas, it just makes everything so much better! The Boba and Milk Tea here tastes just as good as any other one Tea Station in California so I give it a 5 star! n nRecommendations LARGE Boba Milk Tea plain and simple is the way to go! large because you're going to want more!",2
"this place was wonderful, included a full kitchen and nice roomy bed i cant complain at all even when the next day my stay was across the street at hardrock also in walking distance on same block they have CVS where u can get anything and alot of other stores ",2
"We've eaten here several times. The sushi is always good, as is the service. Contrary to other reviews, I thought it was a nice calm quiet place to go. Would eat here again!",2
Loved the red cinnamon sangria and the mussels! Wait staff were friendly and knowledgeable when asked for suggestions.,2
Not a fan of this location. The food was subpar each time I've been.,1
"I won't be playing here again. n nI randomly ended up here a couple of weeks ago with my usual hitting partner and was very disappointed with the facility. For whatever reason, this facility charges a court fee. Most Phoenix tennis courts do not. Apparently for this fee, you get the following n n Disorganized, amateurish staff n Dirty courts n Several courts did not have center straps, which meant we had to wait 30 minutes to access a court n Gaps in the fencing n Grippy but very cracked surfaces n The surfaces are you standard city park surfaces, they are not the nicer, cushioned surfaces you typically see on paid courts n Weirdly, you have to register to play here. Never seen that before! n No water on near the court n The staff disappears at 8 pm n nOn the plus side, the courts are very well lit, and though the benches are not covered, they are spacious. Also, the center is buried within a neighborhood, which makes it both inaccessible and yet fairly quiet. n nThere are better courts to be had, especially for the money.",1
"This place tricks you with the idea of Irish treats. n nMcFadden's definitely caught me at my weakest point. After a long day of meetings, running around Vegas to finish some errands, and a quick ticket drop. I was stuck at Town Square and wanted to eat and maybe catch some of the World Series. n nI stopped in to McFadden's because I wanted to try something new, and didn't want to spend a ton of money at Yardhouse, which is located directly below McFadden's. Walking up the stairs to the restaurant and seeing the place completely empty with a bustling and loud Town Square below should have been the one and only red flag I needed to leave this joint, but being the optimist I usually try to be in these situations, I passed the only twow patrons to this place and sat down. n nFirst thing to hit me was the smell. It was like the bar had thrown up, slammed a beer, and puked again. Great way to kick my hunger into high gear. Here's the kicker, it only came in waves. Slow moving waves of funk. Red flag number two. n nI ordered a drink and some food and took in the place as I pretended to watch the baseball game. I noticed that this place is huge three different bar areas, a very large empty dining room area, and a back front patio for outside dining or smoking, I'm not 100 sure, but there may be been a drunk patron sleeping it off on the front balcony. When I asked if this place gets busy on the weekend, the bartender said its packed Thursday through Sunday, I find that hard to believe. n nMy food finally arrived and I was both shocked and disappointed that for 9 I was only getting three chicken tenders, I had to order fries separately for around 6. The fries were good , but it takes a true talent to mess up fries. The chicken tenders were kinda of burnt and one of them was still raw inside! Yikes, thank goodness I decided to look before I chomped into it. n nI showed it to the bartender and he quickly took it away and brought me another single chicken finger. Yes. He brought me a single chicken finger. I thought this that was pretty weird and as I cut into this foul finger I could tell it had been totally ablitorated in the fryer and I left it on the plate. n nThe bartender here wa s nice, but seemed clueless at times. I would definitely avoid this place even if the line at the Yard House is ridiculously long. Unfortunately, my phone recently died and I lost all of my photos. Therefore, no raw chicken pics, but maybe that's a good thing?",1
"It was a night where the BF and I talked of Scandia and wanted to mini golf and decided to give this a shot. n nI like that everything is glow in the dark, but it was kinda meh. n nSmall and it was crowded with kids and we had a big group in front of us and impatient jackasses behind us who don't play right we actually take our proper turns and keep score so we jumped ahead and came back to holes when they were empty. n nKinda think that will be a one time visit. Instead of building a second location on Lake Mead Blvd by Whole Foods , they would've done good with an expansion. The small course made it not worth the price and definitely not worth coming back. n nWe can't wait to go to Scandia in Cali again. WHY THE HELL did they ever close the one here in the first place?! REBUILD REBUILD!",1
Very nice new hotel. Rooms are clean and large. The hotel staff I've encountered have been friendly and helpful. The rooftop bar is nice and has a great view but it does get very busy in the weekends.,2
"Since moving to the neigborhood I've become an irregular at D E. There are two distinct crowds here, the day drinkers diners who are mostly older people and the younger night crowd. It's quiet during the afternoon but the music gets cranked up at night. This is a good place to catch a football game on Sunday. n nThe staff is great and there's never been a service issue during my many visits. The beer selection is good. They rotate craft brews. I like most everything I've tried on the menu. The wings are excellent and come in a variety of sauces. I prefer the honey hot and the jalepeno BBQ. Their sliders are also very good. n nIt's a sports bar, you get what you expect if you have reasonable expectations.",2
Don't bother! The view is the only thing they have! What a joke! Nobody in the bar! Could it be because of the smelly mop bucket by the front door?,1
We have gotten take out from here a few times already. Their lunch specials are 5.75 6.50 for shrimp .they are very good. I highly recommend their Chow Fun Noodles this is not on the lunch special menu but very good. nService was okay.they weren't personable but not rude.,2
"Solid joint, intimate, woody. My date and I got a great table in the corner by the private room, which was nice because the main area was pretty loud on that Saturday night. n On the downside, a large party of drunks stumbled through to the private room near the end of the date. They needed an asskicking, but perhaps they were regulars and the management let it slide. It happens. n We had the brie toasts, a perfect little appetizer. I had the pork tender loin, which comes out skewer style, perfectly done with a mint jam garnish. The sweet potato stuffed chili pepper seems to be a regular side dish there. It was a new one for me, sweet and fiery, it was great! Creme brulee for desert was top notch, smothered in berries. n n I would have liked to spend more time there, so I'll definitely be back for another round some day.",2
"Located in Fashion Village, this place is great! It's a tiny little shop filled with friendly customer service and a great variety of goods. We stopped in to check out their pipe tobacco and left 2 ounces later spending only 8.50!",2
horrible horrible horribe customer service. They also sit on packages way to long and in some instances loose a package all together. I wish they would just destroy this location and allow the other locations to properly handle mail.,1
"Based upon fellow Yelp reviews, I thought, we're in for a treat! Wrong! n nUpon arriving, the restaurant is so dimly lit that they have mini flashlights so you can read the menu. I also think the lack of lighting hides the mediocrity of the food. n nI ordered the chicken piccatta. It wasn't very tender or flavorful. The accompanying pasta and marinara sauce was the worst I've eaten in a long time. The salad which preceded the entree was swimming in Italian dressing and grated Parmesan cheese. n nThis place would have one star, but the service was attentive. The singer had a good voice and was pleasant to listen to during dinner. I tipped him 5 on my way out to show some appreciation for his talent. n nPerhaps I didn't order the right dish, but I won't be back when I visit Las Vegas.",1
"TERRIBLE VIP SECURITY! nI had a VIP table and bottle service and WAS NOT WORTH IT! nToo packed, too crowded in VIP and I feel even worse for the people who were stuck on the floor smashed against eachother. n nI will say, this is a very beautiful club and when Armin Van Buren headlined this weekend, the show was amazing! nBut it was very hard to enjoy when you crammed like sardines at your VIP table! The security was crappy. They didnt check wristbands, so anyone could get in. But when I left to go to the bathroom, THEY DIDNT LET ME BACK IN! I had to have my friend tell them it was my table. Total BS. n nThere alot of other better clubs in Vegas to check out that will give a better experience than TAO.",1
"Every visit to sin city I always stop in to this place to get my favorite dish, their mapo tofu is so good. Plus the place is very casual and relaxing to hang out and eat with friends.",2
"Pretty pricey for what you get, too dark with too loud music that you can't actually talk to your friends, really weird and off putting menu items. nI got the FEZ burger grilled angus burger with spicy honey molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, cilantro which sounded really weird but intriguing. The spicy sweetness of the BBQ totally overpowered everything else I couldn't even taste the pears and lemon garlic which were two of the main eye catchers in the description. It tasted just like any other BBQ and onion burger. I also split the rosemary garlic fries with my friend and they were basic fries sprinkled in garlic salt way too salty to even taste the garlic. nI was not impressed. n nAlso, I really hate at restaurants when you ask for a box for your left overs and the waitress takes your plate out of your sight instead of letting you put your own food in the box. All she put in was half my burger when I had bits of the other half and salad also on my plate. Super peeve of mine!",1
The food the restaraunt is a nice place but the waiting staff is beyond slow. My waiter Gina took 25 mins just to bring me water. I find it ridiculous that the service is so slow. The to go menu by the door lists different prices for happy hour items but the management barely wanted to honor it,1
"I arrived during happy hour on Saturday. My husband and I were greeted immediately and were seated in under 2 minutes. Sheila was friendly and answered any questions we had about the menu items. We ordered 1 of each tostada offered salmon, tuna, tako, hamachi ,baked mussels, salmon avocado roll, spicy tuna, and firecracker roll with hot sake all off the happy hour menu. Everything was great. The baked mussels were exceptional. During our time there Sheila and 2 other employees whose names I did not get were all very attentive and genuinely friendly. I felt they were sincere and unlike many other restaurants there seemed to be no issue regarding whose table it was. We ordered more. Another baked mussels only 5 for 5 , ika geso calamari with dipping sauce . Sheila checked back just before happy hour ended to see if we wanted to get any other orders in under happy hour pricing. We were happily stuffed and passed. All this with 1 ashahi draft and 2 sakis was only 40 pretax. It was a great meal at a great price with friendly not fake service in a casual but appealing environment. We will be back.",2
My wife and I love troy. Troy is a great handyman extremely polite and very honest. I trust him completely and would recommend him to anyone.,2
"Finally trying this place out for a quite girls night out. First, I was a little bit skeptical on the ravin' reviews how good could it be? A friendly gentleman sat us down and our wonderful waitress was giving us spot on recommendations. I love great service! First bite on the appetizer WOW I think i just had da best garlicky hummus in town! The bread that came with it was soo delicious, it wasn't your typical pita bread, it was super moist and tasted fresh from the oven! The half portion strawberry salad pictured was great and filling as well, the added chicken slices were a tad too salty for my taste maybe a better fit on a starch than on a salad . The portions here is huge they can feed up to two people per their menu description so make sure you come in hungry! We also had that days drink special orange martini for 8 don't let the pretty color fool you because that drink was strong! Will definitely be coming back to try other food from their menu, and, oh, they have hh and reversed hh everyday ",2
"There's nothing better than a bunch of spunky vegetarian restaurant people. So, the people were great and helpful when it came to my first timer questions about what to order vegan gyro, singapore noodles for the hubs and me, and plain lo mein noodles for the kiddo. My concern always about a serious vegetarian place is that they skew snobby, rather than populist and happy. Green is the latter. Go Green nice work! PS yes the food is awesome. Just eat here, even if you like meat.",2
"Amateur hour as far as management and staff. n nWe had someone at the table with a shellfish allergy, which was announced, and both the kitchen and service staff mixed the order, which almost ended very, very badly. The only thing they offered for their extreme mistake, was a bottle of wine. That's just not what someone who has just medicated themselves should be offered. Oh yeah, they didn't comp the dumplings that almost killed the person. Not even kidding. n nAnyway, the food was ok. Some good duck salad and some bad dumplings, hot and sour soup and smoked short rib, which was really quite terrible . n nExpect to pay more than you should, and if you have any allergies at all, I just wouldn't trust these folks with your well being. Hope that helps.",1
"Stopped in yesterday for a quick lunch with the kids after a visit to the Science Center. The service was TERRIBLE. Worst experience as a mom ever! The waitress, Abriana, did not have customer service skills whatsoever. Our orders came out incorrect, figures since she didn't even write them down. After we informed her that the orders were wrong, she proceeded to tell us that we were wrong and this is what we ordered. Kids have been waiting almost 35 minutes for the food now. We had the manager come over. He apologized for the error and waited on us the rest of the visit. Food was good, but the service was not up to par. We would not go back.",1
I had one of their giant salads and it was soooo good! I will definitely be back to try their other salads.,2
"This is a great dance club. As most people have said, the view is stunning. I could easily spend a long time just staring out at the awesome sight. And it the breeze is so nice after spending a day in such a hot climate. The place was packed, inside and out but that was ok everyone was in a great mood and were super friendly. And why not? We're all tourists trying to enjoy the Vegas experience! n nWhat impressed me, and earned this place it's fifth star, was the fact that my friends and I ordered a vodka and redbull and they gave me the rest of the can. We were able to go back and buy just a shot of vodka for an easy refill. I have never seen a bar or club do that before. You guys rock!",2
"I had to write about the Orange Tree Golf Resort because I own a timeshare unit there. I bought a unit in 1994, and back then, they were 1 of about 4 timeshares in Phoenix. Now, it seems there are dozens of timeshares in the Phoenix area. Currently, the resort is in the porcess of upgrading all of the rooms, so if you book there, ask for an remodeled room. I haven't seen the newly remodeled rooms, but based on the old style, the rooms are great. The bigest complaint people seem to have about the rooms are the lack of a full kitchen. But keep in mind, the Orange Tree was not built as timeshares, rather, it was a former hotel that went bankrupt. The old units had a ""college sized "" refridgerator, but the remodeled units will have a full sized refridgerator and flat creen LCD TV. The bathroom is the best part of the units, with a two person water jet tub and a walk in shower and television. The resort is in a great location, just a few miles from downtown Scottsdale, or about a 20 minute drive to downtown Phoenix. The on site restaurant and bar are great, and if you are a golfer, the course is fantastic.",2
"This is L L. How can you go wrong? If you been to one L L then you been to them all. It's a franchise, but they do a good job of it. n nThey do chicken katsu really good here. n nI like how they have poke and kim chee but the poke is a bit over priced and it is loaded with onions. sometimes more onions that fish. Then again you can never put a price on good food. n nI really like the Lau Lau from here. It is rare that I can get good Lau Lau unless I am at someone's house and someone's grandmother made it. n nI like how they have the atkin's plate for those who are watching carbs. Portions are big so I would think about going with the mini plate and try 2 different things. n nThe spam musubi is good for what it is. A piece of pan seared spam over rice wrapped up in seaweed. Sometimes I think it is too much rice but it is not like you can't take some of the rice out.",2
"Over priced vodka and gin drinks in martini glasses. I thought for the price you would get a really good martini but they didnt even make it correctly. A little pretentious but the servers are nice, just too expensive for poorly made cocktails.",1
"I just have to say my experience at this restaurant was horrible tonight. The waitress was not very attentive at all. We had to ask another wait staff for refills on our drinks. She seemed to be more focused on other tables than ours. I mentioned our bad experience to the manager and he gave me a half hearted apology.That being said, the food was awesome, the service horrible.the only positive thing about tonight is that I got a 25 gift card.",1

"We go to Vegas at least twice a year and most often stay at the MGM but have stayed up and down the strip Encore Wynn, Caesar's, Luxor, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo and Palms. This time we decided to stay at THEhotel and without a doubt we have found our Vegas home. Check in was friendly and helpful. We arrived about 10 30 and they checked our bags so we could go to the pool and then called when our room was ready. Friends had raved about the pool Mandalay and they were right. The wave pool and lazy river combo kept our daughter entertained for hours. We ate drank everyplace by the pool and what we really liked is not only the friendliness of the staff, but how we didn't feel milked for every last penny. Food, drink, lattes and pastries in the morning and dinner at House of Blues were all very reasonable and help to guarantee that we'll be taking the trip back more often. The Junior Suite is more than enough room for our family and that space was helpful so we could relax as a couple and as a family. Bell and valet service was extremely prompt. All in all a great time and it looks like we've found our home in Vegas ",2
"Oy! Another burger another disappointment. The old lady said it best. WHERE'S THE BEEF? Right sized burger but it was probably a 10 1 patty. The rest was all condiments and sauces. The bun was pretty good though, a would be Ciabatta bread but not as dense or tough. Some spanky sauce, over dilled dill pickles. And Emmental? Really? All the topings were so overpowering that I couldn't even taste the patty, it's like the main component of the burger was a mere afterthought. n nThe poutine. I asked for a small poutine and yet it was a meal in itself. It was ok but as a non traditional poutine goes, they need to go to La Banquise and study up. Burger meat, onions, and shrooms. But a lot of Meh also. It was OK but not very impressive. Although my friend's pull pork poutine was pretty tasty though. n nBONUS Large selection of Steward's pop.",1
"this place gets a LOT of hype and, unfortunately, doesn't live up to it. n ni went for my birthday which was also the start of spring restaurant week. understandably, they were busy. my husband and i arrived early for our reservation, checked in and took a seat at the bar. i ordered a specialty cocktail which was supposed to contain muddled mint and a sugared rim. it arrived with no suragered rim and whole mint leaves. fine. it was still good. n ndinner time came and with it being restaurant week, we looked over the menu. had i ordered off the resturant week menu instead of the regular menu, i would have paid more for the three items than had i just ordered straight off the menu. bad form! n nso my mother and i both ordered the red pepper cannelloni. my huband ordered the green chili pork ? off the restaurant week menu and my brother got the barbeque pork. my brother was the only one who liked his food. the green chili was runny oily and lacked good flavor. n nthe canneloni had ZERO flavor. amazingly bland vegetables inside an amazingly bland red pepper with an amazingly bland sauce on the side. no good. the server who was very nice but very rushed and difficult to find immediately offered to get us something else whcih we appreciated. i got the chopped salad which was fine. nothing special. my mom got the chicken and dumplings again, lacking any significant flavor. the manager came over, apologized for the cannelloni dishes and said they've been experienceing problems and very mixed reviews on vegetable dishes since they opened. i suggest getting to work on something good containing vgetables. this is NOT going to cut it. n ndessert was also ho hum. the pecan fig pie had a great filling but a rock solid crust . my husband said the bacon s'mores were too much work messy and not very good. n noverall i'm totally shocked at the good reviews this place continues to receive. i just wasn't at all impressed.",1
"My bestman booked with VIPNVEGAS to help us organize my bachelors party. He paid the 300 downpayment required to book the event. 5 days prior to my bachelors party, my uncle passed away and we ended up cancelling our trip. I spoke with Rich pleading with him if he can waive our downpayment but due to his company policy 50 was only refunded to my bestman. He said he had to pay the limo service pay for what? a service that hasn't incurred yet? Other Vegas companies that we hired for that weekend were able to waive our downpayment completely once they found what our reason was. I understand that its a policy but I hope this company had been more empathic and compassionate to its clients.",1

"I visited this place on the advice of the Yelpers, and it was lovely. n nI hadn't had time to make a reservation and they were completely gracious about it and squeezed us in. Sitting outside on the back patio is really lovely, as it really does feel like a little oasis. n nI had the red curry, which was excellent. Spiced perfectly and the vegetables were just cooked enough, but not mushy. The jasmine rice was also well prepared I loathe mushy rice . I also had the spring roll, which was easily the best spring roll I ever had, with the balance of cilantro and basil perfectly complimenting the noodles and vegetables. The dipping sauce was also light, without veering into sickly sweet territory. n nMy husband had the noodle curry which was AMAZING. I like my curry, but kept trying to steal his. Again, perfectly cooked vegetables and the rice noodles also weren't overcooked. However, Nicky's has only four levels of hotness mild, medium, hot and thai hot. I ordered hot and my husband ordered medium, and his dish was easily as spicy as mine. n nOur two dinner companions ordered the chef special soft shell crab, which I wasn't overly impressed with, but it wasn't bad, necessarily. The coating for the crab was a little greasy and a little soft. n nThe wonton soup which everyone else ordered was very delicious. The broth was extremely flavorful and the wontons were so light and well seasoned. I could eat buckets and buckets of the stuff. n nThey were quick to refill water glasses and attentive in their service. I wish I lived here so I could get takeout from here all the time. I would recommend for fresh, quick and extremely flavorful thai food.",2

"Why two stars and not four? The answer is the most rude and downright threatening server I've ever encountered! n nSO and I and other family members have been here many times and things have always been great, great that is until snarky shouldn't have a job invaded my SO's personal space with a thinly veiled threat to spit in our food desperately in need of a shave and roundhouse kick to the head server showed up on the scene the other night. n nAs I said, my significant other and I have been here enough to know the place and the menu. We ordered their amazing walnut and feta pizza to share and two beers. The sever got pissy telling us the pizza was not large enough for the two of us, was meant for one person, etc, etc read ""Order something else so my tip is bigger. "" n nWe assured him we were well aware if the size of the pizza and it would be just fine, thanks. He stalked away. n nOh, but only after I asked him about one of the beers and he irritatingly just pointed at the beer menu and said. ""It's THAT. "" n nSO asked for a lemon he puts it in his beer. . When Sir Snarksalot comes by and sees the lemon in the beer he stops and begins to basically attempt to emasculate SO for putting lemon in his beer, stating, if he knew he was using it for his beer he'd never have given it to him. As an aside, SO could have wiped the floor with this guy were he not such a damn Zen master, as he's a martial arts instructor.after what happened next, I really wish he had. n nSO told Sir Snarksalot, ""With every one of your snarky comments your tip is just getting smaller. "" n nThis is when the server leaned threateningly into SO's space and said, ""And YOU should know you never tell a server you're giving them a bad tip until after you get your food. "" n nSO immediately got up to go ask for a different server and I seriously sat there looking for cameras as I was convinced for several minutes I was either being Punk'd or was on ""What Would You Do. "". I kid you not that's how bad it was. n nThe hostess apologized profusely and seated us elsewhere and eventually the general manager found us and apologized profusely, too. What I found interesting, though, was she said they had had similar complaints about this guy before and he'd been talked to before! So.why is he still working there? You can't tell me there aren't dozens of far better servers waiting to take his place. n nThe very next night my coworkers had a gathering there after work. I was regaling them with the horror story of the night before and, who should walk by? Of course, Sir Snarksalot! n nI was aghast he still had a job there. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed the place allows for such horrible treatment of loyal customers to go on without consequence. n nIf you go, great beer, great food, but apparently you should now come prepared to ask your server to ""take this outside "" when they treat you like crap and threaten you.",1

"I went to Vegas for my birthday and we decided to spend as little as possible on hotel accommodations but still on the LV strip . And using all those travel websites and deals, we came up with Excalibur, which by the was still not that cheap, but it was a weekend, so prices tend to be higher then. n nSo up on arrival, things were okay. Free valet is standard at Vegas hotels, so that was good. Once we checked in and went to our room, I was in for a surprise. When I was a kid, I thought Excalibur was the BIGGEST and BESTEST hotel a kid can dream of. Not so much. There was no central air. The rooms were standard size but it seemed kind of musty. One of the handles on the drawers were broken so the hotel staff replaced it with a wire hanger. The ambiance was just not cool. But I guess you get what you pay for. We did end up spending more money on food an entertainment so I guess it worked out. n nBut, I don't think I can stay here again.",1
"I considered giving Z Pizza one star but I thought I would be more generous than one of the staff members was to me. n nIn New Times there used to be a coupon for a free slice of pizza. I saved my coupon as it did not have an expiration date. One day I sauntered into Z Pizza and presented my coupon and ordered a soda to go along with the pizza. I was told by the clerk that I could not use the coupon because ""too many homeless people "" were using the coupon and they no longer honor the coupon. I am not homeless nor do I ""look "" homeless. Instead I was told I could order a special that included two slices of pizza and a soda. I won't ever forget the woman behind the counter who so coldly denied me my slice of pizza. I promised myself that I would never return. n nFew months later. n nI thought to myself ""Self, you should really give Z Pizza another try. Maybe it was just a bad day. "" I called Z Pizza and asked for a delivery of a half soy and half regular cheese pizza. In the past when I had ordered such a pizza, someone from Z Pizza was kind enough to mark which side was soy and which side was regular. I thought the same would happen. I was wrong. I received the pizza with no indication as to which side was soy and which side wasn't. I called Z Pizza and asked about their soy cheese pizzas without telling them my predicament. I was told ""Our soy cheese pizzas are so good you can't tell the difference between regular and soy cheese. "" I proceeded to explain that in this case, I needed to know the difference and asked why it wasn't marked. The woman on the phone asked ""How are we suppposed to do that? "" I stated that in the past the soy side of the pizza was marked by a white piece of plastic that served as both to keep the pizza box from caving in on the pizza and it also served to indicate which side was soy. n nI asked to speak with a manager after I realized I was getting nowhere with the woman on the phone. She told me I would need to call the following day if I wanted to speak with someone in charge. I then asked them to send me a small pizza with only soy cheese as a replacement at no charge. I was told that they would call me back once they got the ok to make me another pizza. They called me back and stated they would give me a small soy pizza but that it was on the bottom of their delivery list and insinuated that it was not a priority. n nIt took another hour for them to deliver the small, soy pizza. n nCustomer service at its finest? I think not. Not only did I have to think for them and offer my own form of compensation for their inadequacy but it was the second time that I had been treated in poor manner. n nSave your money. n nCome to think of it, I think I give Z Pizza just one star. I will not bother ordering from Z Pizza ever again.",1
"Oh yeah this place is so good! The italian guys who run this place are way cool and they will totally remember you after a few visits. I order my pizza well done and when I get there to pick up the pizza they always make sure it looks just the way I want it. Great Crust! The wings are great and the pizza is even better. Its hard to believe that people order crap like Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns when you can get Good pizza at Napoli for the same price or cheaper. Whatever. Great lunch specials and the sandwiches are great to. I feel like im in a pizza joint in New York when I go here.",2
Great food. Nice size portions. The employees are very nice. I highly recommend this place.,2
"The website Certifiedappliancetech states honesty, licensed, bonded and 100 satisfaction. This is all a big lie. In reality, this business is really Jones Appliance out of Globe, Az and the owner is the repairman who is incompetent. Late to show up, overpriced, and made me pay 225 even though he didn't fix my oven. If you see his website, run fast to another company!",1
"They only get 2 stars for the food, which is really pretty good. Their service I'd give them less than 0 if I could. At best a bunch of disinterested young kids sitting around BSing or wandering around inanely doing their best not to pay attention to you. At worst kind of snotty youngsters who seem genuinely put out angry that you would dare to ask them for service. The folks at the bar seem to have the best luck getting responses maybe because the bartender can't ""escape "" and wander around like the rest of them? When the manager is there, there is a ""slight "" improvement when he is not, they'll let you walk in and wander around without offering to help. They don't seem to understand that they are running a business I honestly get the impression that they think they are being paid to ""hang out "" and anything that gets in their way of doing that ie customers is best ignored avoided. Not going back!",1
OMG this place is waaaay over priced. WAY! While I just rolled with our choice to take our friends here for dinner I was amazed at the prices for such simple dishes. n nWe arrived late on Saturday night with empty bellies. The bread basket came out and I must say it was pretty darn yummy. Im a huge fan of bread. Cheese crisps and warm dinner rolls. I dont know about the complimentary platter as we were not served that. For my meal I ordered Chicken Piccota. This was just that a flattened chicken breast for 26. It was good but knowing the price and what you got made it not taste as good as it should if that makes sense and you would think there would be something to go with it but no it came with just chicken. So for dinner I had bread and chicken. Hmm. Our friends ordered the Veal Parm 30 a plate. It didnt look like much of a portion but they said it was good. My BF ordered Tortiglioni Sausages which looked like pasta with a ground sausage sauce with peas. He hated it and continued to eat most of mine. n nThe place is beautiful. The waiter was stuffy. The food wasnt impressive to have a 180 bill at the end of it. Next time I spend that much on dinner I will be eating a steak and potato. Thanks but no thanks Red Rock.we will stick to your other restaurants. ,1
"This place was awesome! Three words 'Urgent Care' 'Appointments'. I had to come in the middle of a work day and was short on time, I was in, out, prescriptions filled and back at my desk on the strip! in one hour. The doctor was not a drug pusher and listened to what I had to say. Did not push a bunch of prescriptions on me and everyone was very professional. Awesome. If you have to go somewhere when you feel like crap, this is the place to go.",2
"This buffet was mediocre. We only ate here because we had a coupon from staying at hotel. There was no seafood. I would rather pay more and go to a better buffet that had seafood. After all that is why the buffets in Vegas are so great. They did have a good dessert selection. Cotton candy machine, ice cream and mini doughnuts.",1
"Lulu's is a small club, in the basement of Tiger Lily, on Edinburgh's 'trendy' George Street. Typical of clubs on this area, prices are a little more expensive than what you might pay a little further from the centre of town, however drinks are reasonably priced although entry can be expensive depending on what night you go. Getting on the guest list is always advised with George Street clubs. Lulu's is lavishly decorated and very stylish, however it doesn't have much else to offer. The music leaves a lot to be desired mainly chart, repeats and descending into 80s hits by the end of the night and the dance space is very small. Staff are friendly but I don't find the atmosphere in here particularly exciting. As far as this part of town goes, I think Opal and Shanghai are much more fun.",1
"The Good Our server was enthusiastic when we could get a hold of him and did his best to be genuine with his recommendations. It's reasonably priced and my 1st marg was just perfectly made there's a catch, read below . n nThe Bad As other's have pointed out, the service was very inefficient. This is by far the 1 reason we wont be going back here. We waited, and waited and waited some more. nFood not so memorable. In their defense, their menu suggests a genuine effort to present a unique and fresh dining experience. Unfortunately, the execution is off. Our El traditional nachos were nothing special. Thin chips, average grade cheese and not so traditional spice levels. You can't call it traditional when the recipe is tamed down to cater to the average 8 year old. Our fish tacos looked delicious but one bite and my mouth was overwhelmed with the taste of onions and possibly radish? . Note to chef When it comes to Fish, less is more. Add too much and you run the risk of over powering the delicate taste of fish. n2nd Margarita As I said earlier, my 1st marg was just perfect and it set up high expectations for the night. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. My super sweet 2nd marg was undoubtedly the handiwork of Baja Bob's not so fresh extra sweet premix. nSalsa and dips Meh. I've had better salsa from a jar at Smiths Rojo's fresh cut salsa rocks! n nAnd the ugly It's true. He probably isn't yo daddy",1
Growing up in East Texas good BBQ is hard to find in AZ. I've been here several times and it is always great. The brisket just melts in your mouth. One of my AZ favorites is the full rack of Pork Spare Ribs with his Prickly Pear Cactus BBQ sauce on it sitting with a giant pile of crisp french fries with a pickled jalapeno they make in house. It use to be a special and may not be on the menu any more and you may have to ask for it but it is truly yummy. Last time I just ask for it and the owner said sure . coming right up. We have used them for catering small and large events and the food comes ready to go. Just wish he had some Texas Sausage on the menu. A bit of a drive but well worth it.,2
" See Jen C.'s review below as my experience was almost identical to her experience, down to the haggling for more tips at the end. WTF. FU. DU MA. n nThe lack of professionalism overshadows the mediocre massages I and two other friends of mine received. Effing terrible.",1
I ate here once. Probably won't repeat. nI think the only thing that keeps this place alive is the fact that there is not many Mexican choices in the neighborhood other than the typical chains. Reminds me of the old style gas stay ion burritos. I definitely was not impressed. I do not see the place lasting,1
"If there were a 6 star rating, I'd give them 6! Wow! Everything we had was simply amazing. Beef, yellowtail, even tofu. This place has definitely made it into the ""must hit "" list each and every time we go to Vegas 3 4 times per year . Cannot wait!",2
"If you're into cars, you're familiar with the concept of price independent vs. price dependent reviews. For example is the new Corvette better than the current Ferrari Italia? On a price independent basis, pffft, not even close. But the price dependent verdict? Absolutely! Is Fat Choy a better restaurant than, say, Joel Robuchon? Uh . NO. But when you factor in price, yeah, I'll say yes, it is, because the average tab per person tax and tip included at Fat Choy is 15 20 whereas the average cost per head at Joel Robuchon is 25 quadrillion dollars OK, slight exaggeration . n nThe quality of the food at Fat Choy is very good. When you consider the bang for your buck, Fat Choy is off the charts. Where else in Las Vegas, or anywhere in America for that matter, can you get roasted bone marrow for 8 or duck confit for 12? Those are the two menu items that I put in the gourmet category the other two categories are Asian fusion and American standards. I'm not a big fan of bone marrow it's just a bit too rich and the flavor too strong for my tastes. That said, I did think the one bite I got when my cousin ordered it was pretty good. My cousin who finished off every last bit of the marrow was flabbergasted by the price, insisting that for a bone that large, he would expect to pay 20 at least. But I am a huge fan of duck confit, and at Fat Choy, it's as good as I've had it anywhere else, with the bonus of an astonishingly low price. n nIn the Asian category, my favorite is the pot stickers. It always baffed me that pot stickers are on every single Chinese restaurant menu in America because I've never much cared for them. But wow, I love the pot stickers at Fat Choy. The wrapper isn't gummy or rubbery like in every Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in, and the filling is leaner and more savory. My other favorites are the sesame noodles and the fried pork sauce noodles. The sesame noodles feature some mushrooms I forgot which variety that add a delicious layer of flavor to the sesame. If you let the fried pork sauce sit for a couple of minutes, the noodles absorb all the deliciousness of the fried pork. Both baos are great, pork belly and duck. For a foodie on a budget describes me to a T , the Peking duck bao is a real gourmet treat. Again, how many places in Las Vegas, or anywhere else, can you enjoy gourmet quality for seven bucks? n nThe menu category I don't much care for is the American standards. Don't get me wrong, they're done OK. It's just that I don't like that kind of food. But if chicken wings, spaghetti meatballs, and cheesesteaks are right up your alley, you'll be satisfied at Fat Choy. n nMuch has been made of the smoke issue inside the Eureka Casino, which was described in a local magazine as the kind of casino where chain smoking gamblers are surgicaly grafted to their favorite slot machines. To borrow from the immortal wisdom of Bart Simpson It's funny because it's true. Fat Choy recently got a smoke eater system, which has helped tremendously with the smoke issue. I'll admit, I used to get pretty bothered at times by the smoke blowing in from the casino. If you're extremely smoke sensitive, the smoke eaters might not be enough. Actually, if you're extremely smoke sensitive, you'll never survive the walk through the casino to get to the restaurant. But for me, the smoke issue is now a non issue. n nThe very short walk through the smokey casino is well worth it. Besides great food at astonishingly low prices, Fat Choy has a passionately committed executive chef, Sheridan Su, and a terrific, warm, and friendly genuine warmth friendliness, in Las Vegas? staff headed up by general manager Jenny Wong. For any foodie, a trip to Fat Choy is a good idea. For a foodie on a budget, it's an absolute must.",2
"We are visiting from NYC for a week and we went there for dinner at the suggestion of our concierge at Royal Palms with a promise of a nice view and live music. nThe Steak was superb! I can honestly say it was probably the best Fillet Mignon in my recent memory. Wine list is very very good, 300 markup is a bit much but I guess that is how they make money. We split carrot cake for desert and it was also out of this world. My only criticism is the cocktail I ordered was Vodka gimlet and it really had no vodka in it, so, instead of complaining about it which i think leads to just another splash of bad vodka and ""bad blood "" with a waiter, i ordered a shot of Vodka on the side. I got about half of Merlot wine glass of vodka instead of a shot glass and they charge 14 for it! So, my drink ended up costing me 29! nThe steak was excellent and we will definitely come back next time we are in town.",2
"Considering the long line and all the different types of food, I was expecting a pretty decent meal. Um.not so much. The pesto chicken pasta was bland, the rolls were stale, and the food just seemed sad and flavorless. But on the bright side, it was free since we were staying at TI.",1
"The lake is fun and large enough to spend a few hours exploring. The folks at the marina are friendly, helpful and a pleasure to work with. Enjoy renting a boat or house boat",2

"If I could give zero stars, that is how I would rate this place. I have been in 3 rooms, due issues during my two day stay here. My first room smelled like someone just cook Chinese food in it. The second room smelled like somebody had been smoking cigarettes in it all night and I found a bedbug in my bed so gross. Some people say to stay in cheap places because in Vegas all you need is a place to sleep. I was not a believer and still aren't. I will never do this again I will pay for a very expensive room next time.",1
"As it was my mother's birthday I asked her what type of food she wanted to eat ""Greek "" she said. Panama was not the first place that sprang into my mind A I hadn't been there yet and B with a name like Panama greek food is not the first thing that springs to mind. So looking at the pitiful choice for greek we have here on the west island i did a yelp search and lo and behold. n nWe had reservations for around 6 30. Being a group of 7 we were seated along the back wall a good spot as we were well out of the fray, because as the night went on the place became filled to the rafters literally they have a loft area as well . n nThe service was friendly and our waiter was as attentive as he could be considering the number of clients he was taking care of . It did appear that they were a little short staffed but it really didn't affect the service all that much, so that speaks volumes. n nTo start, I ordered a Pikiia platter and it was plenty for the table. Everything on the platter was delicious n nWe ordered 2 orders of sea bass which we split between 3 people with an couple orders of rice and potatoes and and house salads for all , my brother ordered the lamb platter which was delicious but not enough for a man with a big appetite, my husband had the souvlaki platter, my sister the red snapper and my daughter a greek salad. The food was delicious. My mother even sucked the life out of the fish heads! n nThe cocktails margaritas, mojitos and a dirty martini were also really good. n nThe total at the end of the night was near 600 but considering we were 7 people, ordered alcohol and a bottle of wine I'd say it was pretty reasonable. n nI'll go back for sure.",2
"Damn good pizza! A little spendy hence why I didnt give them 5 stars for what you get but regardless, the pizza is pretty damn good. The wings are decent, I think there baked instead of fried and the sauce seems a little weak. They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food.",2
"I really enjoyed our experience here. I am a fan of Mario Batali, B B, Osteria, and Mozza are all great! n nWe came in after seeing a show and wanted to grab an appetizer and glass of wine at the bar. Our bartender, Miki, was superb. He was very attentive but not overbearing. He made some great suggestions for a couple items to share. We had the tagliatelle with ramps, mushrooms, and prosciutto and a salad of arugula and goat cheese with pickled onions. Started off with great warm bread with lardo and butter. MMM good. Both the salad and the pasta were great. The portion of the salad was surprisingly large. Miki also made a great suggestion with the wine. I liked that even though we ordered glass by the wine, he opened a new bottle and poured for us and left the bottle out for us to see. Very friendly staff across the board. I would definitely suggest sitting at the bar. Great!",2

"After a couple of hit and misses on our meals in Scottsdale while here on a business trip we decided to take the advice of the manager at Old Town Cruisers where we went to rent bikes.And that was.come to Delfalco's Deli.The sandwiches we had for for lunch were probably the best sandwiches we have ever had.Sadly we could eat only half because we were already enjoying our beautiful cappuccinos made by Antonio.The freshness of the food,the outstanding service and incredibly reasonable prices make the place the highpoint of our few days in Scottsdale.In fact we loved the joint so much we came back later that evening for dinner.We had the best calzone money can buy.my God it was good.My wife being a very versatile cook has made calzones and makes them very well but not as good as these guys.We even took a tub of their imported gelato back to the hotel.It was a very unique flavor and I thought it was great.If we had known from day one how good this deli was we would have eaten here every meal.As it is this is the only place we have dined at twice in the same day.How sad that we don't have a great joint like this back in San Diego.Oh well I guess that's why we travel.",2

"As an inexplicably popular Phoenix destination, I've dined here over the years and been reasonably satisfied. Service is tolerable, speed is tolerable, ambiance is tolerable. It's a little overpriced for the quality but I was able to swallow it. n nUntil tonight. My group was seated out at a patio table which had the umbrella still on it so we were sitting in shadows. We asked for a candle for some light ""We're out of candles, I guess we're not doing candles on the tables anymore.

If the people you're sending out with food can't answer simple questions with anything better than a blank stare, MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE CARRYING OUT THE FOOD n nContinually empty water glasses and slow service to the end, I left satisfied only in the knowledge that I will never patronize this restaurant again.",1
"Joe's is one my favorite restaurants.

Their homemade root beer is great but I never get it because they serve my favorite bottled ginger ale, Boylan's they score quite a few points for having a nice variety of bottled sodas . Their chocolate chip cookies are incredible, especially when they're warm they bake them in small batches so they often are . Again, the barbecue isn't always amazing, but with great sides and soda and dessert offerings, you can always expect a great meal at Joe's. n nThe atmosphere is perfect for a barbecue joint better than the better tasting barbecue joints I've dined at in Kansas City , and the staff is always super friendly and welcoming.",2

"I ordered their Lamb Shawarma and crab cake bites appetizers last night. I woke up promptly at 5 30 this morning and proceeded to puke my guts out. I'm not sure which did the job, but they were the only things I had eaten that day.

"I'm staying here now and am disappointed that we decided to do so. Ok, so we got the free offer for 3 nights and needed to go to Vegas for a trade show. We had offers from 2 other hotels, but thought old Vegas would be cool. After checking in we tried to nap this afternoon to construction noises from the next room. Unfortunately we tried to call the front desk and no one answered the lines endlessly. Then, we tried to call the manager's office, no answer there for 15 minutes. Of course, now we are unhappy. So, we call Security, three times and they tell us they will check out the loud repair sounding noises, on a Sunday coming from the room next to us. No call back. When I called again, the Security employee told me to ""get over it ""! Well, we marched down to the front desk and eventually had to pack up everything and we have been moved to another room. n nThe hotel is old, that's ok, and it is undergoing some renovation, that's good. But customer service is weak. n nLet's give them a chance to get better. I hope they do.",1
"UPDATE 5 2008 n nThey changed their menu due to hiring a new cook. I assume the old cook is gone. The dishes here just don't taste like before. n nThis restaurant is no longer one of my favorite. My favorite chinese restaurant in Las Vegas would have to be Ping Pong Pang then. n n n n nThis is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas area. I have been there countless number of times. The prices are reasonable around 10 15 per dish. My favorite dishes is the Beef brisket hot pot. Another dish I like is the three cups chicken in hot pot. n nMost dishes taste quite authentic, especially those 'hot pot' menu items. However, some dishes like Ma Po Tofu look and taste nothing like they way they should. n nThe vegetable dishes are good too. One reason I like the food here is because the vegetables here seem to be washed thoroughly.",1
"I'm a sucker for home mailer coupons so I decided to try this salon for a discounted ""spa pedicure "". My first impression was that it looked a little rundown and not too clean. I was immediately led to a massage chair which looked worn. There was one other customer getting a pedicure when I arrived. The woman who sat down to do my pedicure was pissed off and seemed sick. Yikes! I wanted to leave but she already had my feet soaking in lukewarm water no liner . I wasn't given a menu of pedicure options. She barely looked up at me and just slapped my legs whenever she needed me to move. She coughed into her arm and looked miserable. She also spent most of the time looking angry and yelling in another language at the man who worked there. They were clearly arguing. She rushed through my pedicure and was looking away most of the time. Instead of the relaxing experience, I was stressed out, afraid that she was going to cut me with the nail clippers! The polish was done sloppily and the nails weren't cut straight. She rolled her chair over to work on someone else without even looking at me to acknowledge that she was done. After several awkward minutes I started to get up from the chair. She yelled ""no move! "" Then a sullen young man teenager? who'd been standing around came over to put my flip flops on my feet. I walked to the front with him and he stood in front of the register without saying anything. I handed him the coupon and money. No one looked at me or said thanks for coming. nThat's what I get for trying to save a few bucks! From now on I'll go to my usual place across the street.",1

"Went there years ago and it was great. Never had a problem. Went in today and the office looked run down and unprofessional. I was just there for a prescription refill. After showing the Dr. my prescription bottles of very mild mediction she refused to give me the full thing saying she wasn't sure how I'd react. I've been taking these for over two years after getting these original prescriptions from specialists. I know what works best for me and I had proof with the bottles as well as my medical records. She continued to talk to me like I had no idea how or when to take them. She made me feel like I was some kind of addict. She recommended something else and I said no because I don't like the ""high "" feeling from other medications for my condition. I would never recommend them to anyone again ever.",1
"Finally had a chance to make it over to the new location pretty awesome! n nFor what it's worth, I think they are, without a doubt, the best brewery in the entire state. n nCool digs, free pool and great beer. They had a one off on tap when I went a very drinkable session beer which I think was classified as a Belgian pale ale. It was nice, had subtle hints of coriander and orange, and was totally delicious. Ballistic was the standout you know, because IPAs are where they shine. n nI will absolutely go back for food.

"Cafe Bellagio is a casual restaurant tucked away in a corner by the Conservatory. The establishment itself is very casual yet elegant, and it's open 24hrs! That's so awesome. I usually make two to three trips to this place during a weekend in Vegas. nThe first time I came here, I ordered their Thursday lunch special I think it was veal or lamb and it was melt in your mouth delicious. I was hooked. On subsequent visits, I ordered raspberry french toast brioche and berry parfait, both were yumm o!. The presentation of the food was very nice, portions were decent, but the food a bit overpriced, which I expected because it's Vegas and it's the Bellagio for goodness sake. Service was attentive though it can get a little spotty during peak hours but that did little to ruin my experience here at the cafe.",2

We sat at the counter in front of the cooks and they were all very friendly and chatty. n nIt was my first experience eating a fatburger and probably my last. I ordered the small burger and skinny fries. The taste of the burger was too salty. Good thing I had water to help it go down. I was really disappointed with it. The skinny fries were good. Crispy and a good amount. n nFortunately there are other good places to eat in GVR. As far as Fatburger, thumbs down.",1
"For Muslims that are particular about eating halal, this place is a gold mine. A variety of cuisine ensures that you won't get bored by the menu quickly. They serve American staples, such as hamburgers, chicken fingers and wings etc., as well as South Asian variety dishes. My personal favorite is the chili chicken plate. n nThe location is also a plus, as if you frequent the booming nightlife that's developing downtown, it's an ideal location to eat late night or before you decide to go out to the various downtown venues. n nMy only wish is they bring back a few other staples that were under previous management, such as hot dogs.",2
"Since when did Swensens start sucking, or has it always and I just had lower standards in high school? n nSo the hubs and I dropped off the pup over at Petsmart to be groomed and want to grab a quick bite.

You can tell they are not fresh and that they come from a freezer, the patties were pretty rubbery. We both order burgers that came on sourdough bread grilled in a garlic butter and Parmesan cheese spread. The bread was boarder line burned unedible. Not grilled at all,but charred and black. The fries were decent. n nThe malt was tasty. But nothing show stopping. n nSwensens is probably good for ice cream and that's it. I wouldn't go here for a meal ever again.",1
"This little spot is hidden away on the corner of Jones Robindale. My first time checking out the place, I walked into a small dinning area maybe seating at most 20 or even less . Looking at their menu, they offered different kinds of bento boxes trax fried rice. n nBreaking down trax fried rice, you basically choose 3 veggies to be mixed into your fried rice, which you can also choose white or brown rice how awesome! . Then you get your choice of shrimp, beef, chicken, which can be prepared grilled, battered, or katsu. n nOh man.the options! n nSo I decided on shrimp chicken all grilled. They serve your food in a black to go container whether you're having it there or to go. So, it did take a bit of time to get the food, but it was understandable since there were no empty seats in the house when I got there. Anyhow, the food was great. The fried riced was a great portion soo yummy. Totally hit the spot. I did like the shrimp chicken skewer, which you get 4 of, but unfortunately it wasn't enough meat to go along with the rice. That made me kind of sad, but for the price and the left over fried rice I had, I didn't mind so much. OH! I also forgot that they have yummy dipping sauces you can chose to dip your tasty proteins in too. I got the sweet chili garlic sauce. Both were good.",2
"Despite being huge, GO Outdoors has rarely delivered exactly what I was looking for, and the savings aren't great enough to justify the compromise. For those unfamiliar, the store runs a 'discount card' scheme under which, for u00a325 a year, you get a reduced rate on everything. In my view, this is just a transparent marketing ploy the unreduced prices are extortionate, while the 'discount' rates are merely reasonable. n nThe staff, when I've asked for help, haven't seemed particularly interested or well informed. I'm aware this makes me sound like a snob, but this is the kind of place you'd go to buy a festival tent that you'll use once and throw away. Imagine a giant Millets, but with less atmosphere. n nTiso down the road may have a smaller stock and be a bit more expensive, but more often than not I'll leave with the thing I went in for.",1
I have been here quite a few times but today was BS! Below standards normally they have phenomenal service but our waiter seemed distraught and it took a good 25 minutes just to place our order. The food was ok not as good as it used to be and the bread was as hard as a rock and when we asked for some fresh ones they refused saying that there only allowed 2 per person.Also every time we asked our waiter for something it took forever we would have to remind him multiple times before he actually brought it! All in all this place isn't worth the price.,1

Didn't want to but it was for one of my oldest friends and I didn't want to disappoint her. n nI only ordered drinks and had some chips and salsa.

Not impressed. n nYelpers please keep in mind that some of the 5 star reviews you see posted for Aunt Chiladas quite possibly may be an employee. How do I know this? Because I got a message from an employee after my last update. She said that she knows which bartender I am talking about that was rude at my HS reunion and said ""he is really great, just not for banquets. "" She also said ""I do not know why any server would yell at you, that is just ridiculous. "" And my personal favorite ""And yes, there is bacon and lard in our re fried beans. I have no hispanic background, so I am not sure what is traditional. But they are pretty tastey. "" But then she says "" nWith that said, I really hope you come back. "" n nDirect quotes. And this employee has a glowing 5 star review for Aunt Chiladas and she says nothing about being an employee. Isn't this breaking some sort of Yelp rule? And what business does she have messaging me unless she is a manager? n nSorry but I wouldn't trust any Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area that has less than 4 stars. There are many better choices.",1

"My wife and I went to this restaurant just a few days ago. We were very pleased at the service, the food, and the price. I have really been surprised at some of the reviews for this restaurant on Yelp, as our experience seems to have been better than some others have had. I got cheese enchiladas, which came with rice and beans, and it was delicious! The chips were fresh and the salsa was not bad. The menu is packed full of New Mexico style mexican food, so you should expect that. I am new to Arizona, and this will be a place I definitely want to go back to. I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews on here, but we were more than satisfied with the food, and the staff was very nice and prompt. We give it four stars and recommend you give it a try. And stay away from El Palacio, in Chandler, as we ate there tonight and it was horrible. I have another review for that place .",2
"It is a bit shocking to me that people like this place so much. Have they just not had a really good pizza before? I really don't get it. n nThe first time I tried Sauce, I went with the hand stretched chicken pesto pizza. It was OK good crust, but a little too sparse on the toppings. I really wish when they made these pesto pizzas that they'd try to make the pesto stand out a little more. They always try to go light on the pesto because people in Arizona hate things that taste good, and pure, unadultered pesto tastes good. n nMy recent visit, I went to the Dana Park location, and I made a huge mistake I accidentally ordered the thin crust. I blame the person behind the register for not reminding me that they have two crusts good, and pure sh t , and of course, by default, they give you that horrible cracker crust. n nSo my meal was effectively ruined, even though I felt I made a solid choice with the portobello and artichoke. n nPeople might tell you Sauce is good, and they might have even been eating their awful cracker crust pizza but make no mistake, that crust is the worst. If you get the flatbread pizza, you will be getting a much more average pie, and it may even be a reasonable choice for the Mesa Gilbert area. But I give them two stars just for offering that abortion of a crust as the standard option.",1

Although they're well known for their pastrami sandwich, I of course took the plate less traveled and opted for their special that night, which was the pot roast. Jackpot hit!

"Their sushi is good, however limited in selection. I really enjoy the dragon roll and that's about it. I have had their lunch boxes and they are ok, not particular better than Sarku Japan's and yet they are pricier. n nThe atmosphere in this place is modern and hip and therefore the booths are rigid and painful to sit in. The chairs I believe are also without padding. n nOverall I would give it 3 1 2 but I can't take half of a star off.",2
"Wynn is known for it's high class quality and luxurious digs. So the Buffet at the Wynn is not excluded. Just because it's a buffet doesn't mean it has to be plain and basic and a lot of mediocrity! The Buffet has quite an array of ethnic delights prepared exquisitely well. If you're one of those that try to get a bit of everything on your first plate, it's never going to happen here. The assortment of food is so vast I think you'll need at least three trips before being able to experience a bite of everything. Word of advice, line up early on Fridays and Saturdays, say 5 5 30pm. If you're a preferred patron whale to be ask the pit bosses for a line pass. The Buffet doesn't serve brunch on most days, but if you get in by 11am you have the benefit of eating breakfast foods and within 30 minutes option to have lunch also! hint hint ",2
"I hate the quality of tint used on my car. I had my previous car tinted years ago and it noticeably kept the heat out of my car to a more normal level.

"WORST JEWELER IN TOWN. I purchased a ring from my Jewler in California and brought it in to get resized. Something as simple as that and thought I could trust them to do it. They seem like a trustworthy Jewler. So I thought. When I went back to pick up my ring the Jewler in the process had scratched the glass on the ring they said that they would fix it. When I came back almost a month and a half later my beautiful ring was ruined. I got it back with the jewlers finger print on the inside of the glass and epoxy visible on the glass. When I complained and told them they need to fix or replace my ring the response I got was ""you would have damaged it anyway "". I was pissed and grabbed my ring and left. Worst experience and customer service. I will never go to them again nor will I refer anyone I know to go there. nArisa Thepprasit",1

"Food was whatever and Service was horrible. I had to ask for water, bread, etc. When I received my entree, the steak Kababs I could not even eat them all as several were just fat skewers.

Service was extremely attentive and the servers made really good recommendations. It was a Tuesday night so it was not terribly busy and the thought that I hope they stay in business crossed my mind. n nThe food was impressive and the standouts include the Mignon skewers, Chef's belly, and rainbow ice cream mochi. nThe mignon skewers were tender and tasted great even though it looked too saucy . nWhat can you say about a three layer pork belly slice, nothing except that you have to order it! And I really liked the rainbow ice cream roll because they apparently melt down regular mochi and piece together their own Frankenstein version. Ice cream was great and the mochi texture was still consistent to what it's supposed to be, chewy like. n nOpen late but note kitchen closes half an hour before their listed closing time.",2

"I recently moved to the area and choose Spinato's after reading reviews on Yelp. So I expected a decent pizza. However, I was quite disappointed. I ordered a basic pepperoni and mushroom pie and was pretty horrified to discover it was made with CANNED mushrooms. Ugh. I can't believe any self respecting pizza place uses canned mushrooms. Also, there was very little pepperoni on the pizza and it was loaded with a ton of mozzarella and the sauce was incredibly sweet. I will admit that I'm a bit of a pizza snob who's eaten my share of first rate New York City pizzas. I also tend not to order from mainstream pizza places, preferring instead to only get pizzas from places like Parlor or to make my own where I know the ingredients will be high end. But I can still appreciate a good, old fashioned basic pepperoni pizza. This was NOT it. In fact, it was no better than a chain store pizza. I doubt I'll order it a second time. Very disappointing. I'm actually very puzzled by the overwhelming number of positive reviews?",1

"We ordered our Wedding Cake from Chef Flemming for an in suite wedding in a hotel on the strip. It was fantastic! We provided him with a design that we liked, and he nalied it. In addition, the cake was delicious. We had a 3 tier cake for 60 people. We chose 2 different types of cake filling icing flavors 1 for the bottom tier, 1 for the top two tiers . The cake was delivered on time, and it looked fantastic. Everyone was blown away by the pefect Las Vegas wedding design. As if all of those things weren't enough, the price was amazing. We compared the price with a couple of other options in Las Vegas, and Chef Fleming came in at less than half of those other options. If you need someone to create a cake for you in Vegas, don't hesitate to call Chef Flemming.",2

Ok this place is pretty cool with it's take on drug culture and basically turning a places normal entree into a pizza. I have had most of the pizza's but what surprised me the most was their beer selection on tap and in the bottle etc. They serve Abita Springs Turbodog which is one of my favorite brown ales. When you go here don't just get the hawaiian pizza try the Yukon Gold Hot Potato pie or something you can get a hawaiian anywhere these days. the sandwiches are quite good as well. It's a little pricey for drinks etc but they do run a nice happy hour 3 6pm I believe. They have a bacon martini it's belvedere and a strip of applewood smoked bacon how could you not enjoy a chain like this? I have always had good service here and it seems to me like it takes a little longer than most places if you order a pizza. Don't get me wrong they go the extra mile with the ingredients etc. but you wait for it. Also if everyone gets a 10 inch pizza most of them are around 11 bucks. It's worth it but the pizza and a few beers and you are looking at 25 bucks plus. So again I recommend the happy hour but anyone who loves pizza and beer should make a trip to any of their establishments.,2

"This is my first time writing a review so here goes I will try to keep it short to the point. n nTerrible, slow, service paired with auto gratuity that isn't deserved the menu says 18 for large parties but our server opted to give himself 20 . , the food is delivered family style even if you each order individually and if you don't pay close attention to what you ordered you'll find yourself missing food that they simply never brought out to your table until you repeatedly ask where it is and they finally bring it two hours after your reservation time . On a positive note, everything we ordered was delicious, especially the crab stuffed peppers! n nBut because of the other factors that occurred I would simply never visit this place again, no matter how good the food was. Working at a restaurant myself it is hard for me to overlook these issues especially since the staff didn't seem to care when we were having issues still charged us for the food that we had to BEG to get because it was taking so long.",1

We sat in the pool room, had the best service and some of the best food we have had anywhere and all of us have eaten in Michelin 3 star restaurants both in the United States and France . Michelin has never reviewed Yi Mei Champion . Two of us had oysters which they both pronounced the best oysters they have ever had anywhere tender, extremely fresh with no chewiness. One of us has eaten several times in a Paris restaurant the features oysters from all over the world, and these were the best he has ever had. The beet salad was wonderful, the best we have ever had, the duck was cooked perfectly, as was the quail. The chocolate souffl u00e9 was delicious as was the apple tart. I am a diabetic, so I got a nice bowl of fresh. ripe berries no under ripe berries. The service was perfect. I recommend Yi Mei Champion to anyone looking for a special meal.

They had to kick us out of our table since other guest purchased the table and the busser ran over me without apologizing. by brother tried to talk to the guy and he was just a jerk. NEVER AGAIN! n nPS the busser even tried to start a fight.,1
"Ordered an Italian beef. Supposedly the special at joeys. Much to my dismay they ran out of Italian beef. Judging by the amount of people no one in the entire restaurant the lack of beef was due to poor planning. Ordered the grilled chicken but at this point I was already disappointed. The sandwich was fare, nothing special in any way. Bland is the best description. n n n n2 4 stars nUpdate I am increasing the rating because of the owner involvement. I have not revisited this location, but the effort to right a customer complaint is highly regarded in my book,",2
"Friendly technicians. Good pedicure, but with a lot less massage than I normally like. The manicure was extremely rushed though. My cuticles were still very messy and I had paint all over my fingertips. It was a gel manicure so the paint came off my fingertips after about a day of me picking it off, but for the price I would have expected more. Both manicure and pedicure did last well though. I've had them for about a week and a half and not a single chip. I'm not from the area, so I probably won't try this place again.",1
"This place is awful! Beware.they lie, cheat, and steal! Do not support businesses like this when there are other honest apartments close to ASU.",1
"Serrano's is one of the diviest restaurants around. The inside decor is awful and their food is totally bland and gross. They have restaurant tables that would be suitable for use at family reunions. They also serve drinks in these ghetto pitchers that they frequently leave on customer's tables. Going to Serrano's is definately not a fun or exciting dining experience, I think I actually felt a sense of despair after dining here.",1
"dogs just ok, nothing special and same with the burgers. would have been higher rating but the service was terrible. made my order wrong then tried to tell me that's how I ordered it. then the fix was to just scrap everything off and give it back to me. longevity doesn't mean u get a free pass on service and quality. Zacks or any other place for that matter is a better option. didn't try the soft serve but I'm sure it's ok. guess I won't get the chance. disappointed.",1
This restaurant kicked out a veteran Pittsburgh Police Officer because an employee noticed he may have been carrying a concealed firearm. This is absurd I will tell everyone I possibly can not to spend a dime is this restaurant.,1
Place is our favorite.the fish is great and the people are cool. Place gets packed in the evenings which is always a good sign. n nWe have been going weekly for several years and can't say anything bad. Hiro and Eddie are the best!,2
"I used to love to go here for lunch during the summer for their iced tea it's the best! The past couple times I've gone for dinner, the whole experience has been a huge disappointment. HORRIBLE service, cold bread, bland food, and icky iced tea. n nThe last meal I had and will ever have there. n nA herd of staff hanging out by the bar, ignoring the customers. nCreepy waiter. nNo bread. Could we get some bread please? Still no bread. nPenne Porcini starchy and bland. nIce tea had a really odd, ""off "" flavor. nStill no bread. nDirty bathroom. nPenne Porcini, later that night NOT good.",1
"Descent food, nothing special. I didn't like the fact they use part of their dining area toward the restroom as storage. Everything was alright but the fact that the waiter didn't come back and check on me if I needed anything else. As it turned out, I did. Some hot sauce, didn't feel like getting up from eating so I ate without.",1
"I expect nothing less than perfect from Gordon Ramsay and BurGR definitely did not disappoint. It was so good that my husband and I had lunch at BurGR two days in a row during our short stay in Vegas. Had we been there another day, we sadly probably would have gone again! n nEven though there appears to be a long line in Planet Hollywood waiting to get a table, the line moves rather quickly. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and efficient. It was also great to see managers moving around and helping wherever was needed. And if you're a fan of the show Hell's Kitchen, you'll be able to see one of the show chefs in the kitchen that is viewable from the sitting area. n nAs starters, we had the jalapeno poppers. The order comes with about 6 that are presented in shot glasses with sauce. The sauce has cheddar, bacon, and ranch. mmm. One of the poppers is supposed to be especially ""hot "" because the jalapeno seeds are left in however, we like spicy and they all tasted pretty much mild to us. Nonetheless, they were sooo good. You definitely get several bites from each popper so if you're thinking 6 isn't much for two, it was just the perfect amount. n nBesides. we ordered the truffle parmesan fries in addition to our burgers. One order of fries was just enough to share between the two of us and we sadly didn't even finish them! They were delicious but with the poppers, burgers, and drinks. it was a lot of food! n nAs for the burgers, I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger on both days. It had cheese, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and roasted jalapeno peppers. I also added duck bacon to it, which was great. My husband tried the Uber Cheese Burger that had fontina cheese, raclette cheese, and goat cheese he added duck bacon as well as the Blue Burger with blue cheese and arugula with of course, duck bacon . We loved each burger and devoured them. The burgers have so much flavor and are cooked perfectly that there is really no need to add anything to them like condiments, etc . The flavors soaked into the burger buns and made each bite so delicious. n nWe look forward to visiting there again soon. Although we did not order them, we ogled over plates that came out. We kept seeing gigantic chili hot dogs come out smothered with so much good stuff that we hope to try. The shakes all looked amazing and if I hadn't been so smitten with their bar drinks, I might have tried one. Can't wait to experience BurGR again!",2
"This place is a small cafe located inside of the Wynn. It's right next to the sports book. The food they have here are like sandwiches, hamburgers, hotdogs, etc. The food is reasonably priced averaging around 10. I ordered the hotdog and fries. The hotdog was pretty huge. It'll definitely fill you up. The fries were pretty good. The food is what you would expect from a casual cafe. The place can get really busy so it might be hard to find a table. You might just have to wait a bit for people to get up. n nThis place is a pretty good place to eat if you are wanting something fast and not so expensive. Definitely worth a shot if you're in the area.",2
"I went to this place once or twice before years ago and was not too impressed with it. They seemed to be all over the place with their menu and nothing I had was all that good. nI went back last night with my girlfriend who comes here a lot and I have to say they have fixed it. A little. The menu is still all over the place but not quite as bad as before. The food is a lot better than I remember. Kind of. My girlfriend ordered the Jambalaya and I was allowed to try a bite. It was really good. Great flavor. I was a little jealous. I ordered the ""Philly "" Cheesesteak sandwich. There is a reason I put quotes around Philly because to call this a Philly Cheesesteak insults Philly Cheesesteaks. Someone from Philadelphia would punch you for calling it that. It was good but no where near a real cheesesteak. The steak was good and there were peppers, mushrooms and cheese on it but that does not make it a cheesesteak. Definitely not a Philly Cheesesteak. nNow I was told we needed to order a Cr u00e8me Brulee for dessert and never a truer statement has been made. It was so good. I don't care if that was made 20 miles away and driven here and they thawed it out. That was good. I'm sure if you go to France and have the real thing this will taste like a pile of something but we aren't in France and this Cr u00e8me Brulee was really good. nI will definitely be back but I will order something else. I guess you just have to be careful what you order. I'm told the orange chicken, honey shrimp and burgers are good and don't forget the Jambalaya. Just stay away from the ""cheesesteak "". nThe price was not bad at all and the service was good too.",2
"Called to see if they had a phone and was told they wouldn't give out that info over the phone! Really! So, they would rather you come in and see if they have the phone you're looking for only to find out they don't. Best competitor advertising I've seen yet and has made up my mind to NOT use Sprint. Well done store staff can't wait to get you on my team, unbelievable!",1
I go here for all my vitamin needs. Started going here when I found out I'm developing cancer. My doctor wanted me to start taking vitamins. The staff is friendly and attentive. Love going here because they carry coconut water by the cases. Best thing to drink ever. So much better than regular water and powerade.,2
"We stopped here on our way to Goodyear from Phoenix. We wanted to try something that we don't have back home. Simply. We made the wrong choice stopping here and there is a reason we don't have this place back home. n n It was Sunday so I had the brunch and it started off great. There is an omelet bar and a carving station, though I stayed away from that meat because it looks as it if was sitting under a heat lamp for a week. Omelet was great and so were the Eggs Benedict. Then the food quality took a nose dive. The potatoes were little rocks, the bacon was mainly just a mound of uncooked fat, most of it looked raw. The ""dessert table "" was a tiny table of donuts and cupcakes. This place was not designed to hold a buffet and that's a fact. Side note The brunch comes with all you can drink mimosas so I figured. why not? It took me 30 minutes just to get one of them and 2 seconds to realize why they are free. n n My wife decided to stay away from the buffet and ordered a salad. Her salad promised ""mixed greens and candied pecans "". It arrived and the lettuce was white, pure white, not a leaf of green. Just the nastiest parts of a bag of iceberg lettuce. The only thing eatable in the salad was the chicken. n n When our waitress finally returned to our table, we only saw her when she took our order and my water glass sat empty for a good 40 minutes, I told her the salad was disgusting. She took it off the bill, which made me happy but honestly if she hadn't offered to I would had demanded it to be taken off because there is no way we are paying for garbage. n n Stay away from this place and don't make the same mistake we did. There MUST be far better options in the area.",1
"i went on a groupon double date to this restaurant and was kinda eh about it since i love me some meat. the crunchy scallop was delicious and so was the house crunchy noodles. although the pepper steak was an interesting texture, it was very flavorful. ill definitely be back for a healthy date night dinner!",2
"Awesome tapas style food. Had some really interesting fusion of traditional pub food and contemporary tapas. We ordered 6 dishes among 3 people which was just right for dinner. I really enjoyed the pork belly corn dogs and salmon belly tacos. There was a watermelon salad served in a plastic bubble which was cool to look at, but the conttrast between the sweet watermelon and vinaigrette didn't work out for me. There was a tater tots dish as well that I thought was good but too heavy for tapas. However, I do appreciate the attempt to try out these flavors. nAlso, the beer was amazing. The IPAs were 5 6. Didn't get a chance to try anything else but given how often the tap changes I would love to go again. nAll in all, great food for tasting with even better tasting beer, with a clean indoor setup and plenty of outdoor seating.",2
"Great, warm atmosphere! The staff is so nice and friendly. Doctor O is very warm and is upfront and gets to the root of the issue for you. I went in with a possible issue and he immediately checked me out and ordered tests that were associated. So glad I found this practice!",2
"We stopped in here for lunch while in the area doing some serious retail therapy. I had done a quick Yelp search and Char Bar No 7 seemed like the perfect place for a decent, quick lunch. n nThe menu was pretty large, with burgers being the star and plenty of ways to customize their burgers. I got the Classic burger but made it a turkey burger for only 1 more. The options for sides were fries, tater tots, or onion rings. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a sucker for a breaded and fried onion, so I went with the rings. My sister got the sweet potato tater tots, and I kind of wish I had looked at the menu more to see they were an option. n nThe turkey burger itself was cooked perfectly and was plenty juicy and flavorful. I asked the waitress if they were made in house. She said they weren't but that they add an in house seasoning blend to the outside of it before they cook it. She also said that the turkey burger is what she gets for lunch every day and it was easy to see why. The onion rings were a let down, though. They were scrawny, thin onion slices with a breading that was a bit too peppery for my tastes. I'm also super picky when it comes to onion rings, so maybe that's just my issue. n nEven though we weren't there to watch any football games, it was nice how they had the helmets of the teams playing underneath the TV so you could easily see which games are on which screens. The service was really quick and we were back on the road to shop some more in no time. For what we were looking for, Char Bar definitely delivered.",2
"I walked in here the other afternoon looking for a good happy hour and boy did I find it. I sat at the bar and the ambiance was outstanding a large open restaurant with a huge bar so you don't feel that cluttered or crowded while you enjoy your food. They had 2 drafts during happy hour which set my mood to Happy. I ordered a few small bites off there bar menu. Chicharones Tacos were very simple yet packed with flavor. I ordered a Chile Relleno and at first sight was disappointed that it wasn't deep fried until i took a bite. I have never been so overwhelmed by the flavors mingling in my mouth until now. A dried Chile stuffed with veggies and spices and boy it had some nice heat as well made me order a refreshing margarita only 5. For once I was intoxicated from the food and not the drinks, only cuz i had 2. I was in heaven and can't wait to go for either happy hour or to explore their menu. After talking with the bartender he informed me that all the food being prepared was made fresh daily. All in all my bill was around 30 with a tip and a few small bites and 2 drinks.",2
Excellent Coffee! My Latte was incredibly smooth and the ambiance was very relaxing.,2
"This review is going to basically follow suit with many of the others.doubt I will be back and here is why n1. They take forever and do not give accurate predictions as to how long it will take for your food to be ready n2. We order pizza and it was not the best. Hardly any cheese on the pizza and especially greasy. n3. The staff seems less than attentive. I sent my 6 year old up to get something and she stood there as employee after employee walked by and didn't notice her, I finally had to get up and intervene. Now, this has little impact on the review, I would hardly hold that against them but was kind sad, poor little gal. n4. The place is too small. Not enough seats and crowds quickly. n nI have partitioned the other Geno's I know of in Gilbert and that one has never had any problems so I'll tell you what, message me when you are up to par with the flagship and I'll swing back by and update review if I find it to be true.",1
I cant believe we paid! nWent in for a brake change which would of cost us about 200 with oil change and ended up needing some other things that i dont know about. I was there for 7 HOURS! SINCE WHEN DOES A BRAKE CHANGE TAKE 7 HOURS! I paid 535.00. It better be worth it. Im lucky my husband was there and knew what they were talking about and he agreed. Another man got there at the same time as we did and he still had 2 more hours to go when we left. n nDONT GO THERE. THE MANAGER IS NICE BUT ITS ALL A PLOT TO SELL YOU MORE.,1
"My family has been going here for fourteen years since we lived in the apartments behind the restaurant and would balance on a water pipe over a creek to walk there! n nThe food has been fresh and consistent. The service is very good and fast. The prices are very reasonable. n nWe always get wonton soup, dumplings, Hunan chicken, garlic chicken, or sa cha chicken. Both egg and spring rolls are good. n nWe will continue to eat here and bring family and friends.",2
"My recent trip to Vegas was for a conference. I wasn't too jazzed when I was told where we were staying but having actually never stayed at the Monte Carlo I thought I'd just give it a chance. Well I was not impressed. The room space is small and dark, the furniture a little outdated with definite indications of wear, the curtains didn't close completely as the curtain was missing pin hooks. The sheer curtain had a hole in it, the bed sheets were clean but had stains. Even though the room was on the 22nd floor, I could still smell smoke. Perhaps I was on a floor that had smoking and non smoking rooms because at times it smelled like it was fresh cigarette smoke. I think the walls are pretty thin too because I could hear the obnoxious neighbors at all hours. And while I recognize that a lot of people come to Vegas to party, it would be nice it they practiced some common courtesy and consideration for those who are trying to sleep. n nMy husband and I come to Vegas every couple of months for some relaxation and gambling. This is not a place I would return to stay. I might come back to the casino on another trip because the dealers were pleasant but as far as I'm concerned this is NOT a 4 star hotel so I would not stay here again. n nI'm sure if someone is just looking for a place to lay down their bags and are out of the room most of time, this place may be okay.",1
"I understand compromises must be made when making cakes without flour must add lots of sugar . That being said, the 3 10 inch cakes I ordered for a party turned out well, but not great. n nOf the 3 cakes I ordered 1 carrot cake with cheese cake icing, 2 chocolate cake with raspberry filling and chocolate icing, and 3 almond cake with vanilla icing and sprinkled with slivered almonds the chocolate cake turned out best. n nI was pleased with the cakes' taste, but most disappointed with the way they are decorated. The ordinary decoration makes the cakes look like they were purchased purchased from Costco or Sam's Club!",1
Pros nSome of the best chicken fingers there is. nGood sweet tea. nGood garlic toast. n nCons nTOO MANY CALORIES. nCane's sauce is kind of gross. nOnly 4 meals available which all consist of different amounts of the same thing. n nRaising Cane's I love you but you could at least have some hot sauce available.,2
"Smaller version of the real HT! This place had such limited options for products sizes, varieties that it's very frustrating. I went in in night for cookie dough and all they has was the pre portion variety and not the roll of dough more common. All the sections were smaller deli, bakery it was a joke! Also I wanted only a small can of pineapples for using the juice in a recipe and all they had was the huge size which I didn't need . Go in only if you're in a hurry, this is not a good full service store.",1
"Ordered a bowl of pho here, the bowl of food came, but there was no basil or bean sprouts on the side. I let the waitress know they haven't brought me the basil, and she informed me that they ran out.but the next table had some. If they ran out of basil, at least bring me some bean sprouts right? Or explain why they let me go ahead with my order without informing me that they had no basil so that I might select a different dish that didn't usually come with the herb. n nEnough said. n nIf you are really craving Vietnamese noodles in the K W area, take a chance and go to Pho Dau Bo near King Cedar. n nNever expect service from these restaurants, but at least Pho Dau Bo hasn't run out of basil and kept me uninformed about it prior to taking my order and then seemingly lied to my face afterward while the next table chewed on their basil.",1
"I am now on Team Jessica. Walk in appt. and they seated me instantly. Thebfirst thing I noticed was that this place was spotless. Jessica quickly made me comfy with some bottled water and mags to read. Foot massage, sugar scrub, neck shoulder masage and then on to my mani. I have been wanting to try the new shellac method and decided it was a go.i decided on a color they are limited but I Bet more colors will come soon . End result ECSTATIC. Total was 45 for both. Had I decided on a regular mani it would have been 35. Everyone was very nice and attentive. I am definitely coming back.",2
"They were fast I got most things that I ordered within 10 minutes, but was quickly disappointed. Key word being most they forgot several of our orders for well over a half hour and brought out the wrong beer for one person we got a comped beer but still not a promising start. The tuna was a bit too grey. The yellowtail nigiri was described as ""crispy "" by one of our companions, who also claimed to have gotten a bone in his bite. The rolls were stuffed to the gills with imitation crab and a few of the fish pieces were picked off due to their unpalateable look. We've eaten at a lot of sushi places, and I was stoked when I heard people actually speaking Japanese! Plus the scallop sashimi, unlimited uni and oysters was a huge selling point for me, which was the main reason I harassed my party of four into going. While it's nice that these items are offered, the overall impact left a lot to be desired. We tried the salmon which was OK, the highlight of the sashimi. I got scallops a bit dull and chewy, oysters which were fresh ish but not fabulous, shared the ""Skreem inor gazim "" which was one of the better moments, a bit of soft shell crab soooo much better at Bluefin! , a few mediocre pieces of yellowtail and tuna. one of our companions opted out of eating anything, the other barely picked at their food. I had high expectations and really wanted to like this place I mean, AYCE sashimi?! OMG, that'd be AWESOME if the fish were more appetizing. I'll stick with Bluefin, the fish tastes a whole lot fresher and I like their in house specials cajun albacore, special rolls, appetizers, etc a lot more, plus the lower price. The poki at Hikari didn't compare to the poki at Island grill or Yama. It was fun being able to speak japanese with them, and they were fairly attentive, but not worth the trip from my side of town and not worth the price for the quality of the fish. Bummer!",1
"I just had the most buzzard experience ever. I live near this Papa Murphy's and always see the sign so I decided to give it a try. I called and asked for a Cheese Pizza. They asked for my name and phone number and I went to pick it up about 10 min later. I get there and there is a uncooked pizza on the table. I asked the lady this is not my pizza right? She says yes, we are a take and bake. I'm respond, nobody told me. She says oh we don't have to tell you that's how we are. I say I have hungry ppl and I don't want to have to bake this myself. She gets mad and says that's rude. At this point I just walk away and tell her you need to inform ppl on the phone as you have a different concept and many people don't know. Unbeliaveble. Papa Murphy's management. Freaking include as part if your phone etiquette. We are a take and bake pizza how may I help you. Not that hard to do so. I'm so mad I shouldn't even give you this business tip. I will never ever ever be back there or any papa Murphy's ever!",1
"I went there for the first time yesterday. I had the bison dog with fries. I thought the food was really good. The one downfall, I got the homemade ketchup with the fries, It was o.k. it tasted more like thick marinara sauce than ketchup. n nThe service was pretty good, and I was happy with the large selection of beers they had to try. Some of the descriptions could have been a little better on the board so you had a better idea of what you were getting.",2
"Some people organize a private party once a year here as part of a convention. It's not cheap, but the all you can eat sushi has been pretty much the highlight of that weekend each year. It is freaking tasty. I've had a decent amount of sushi this place is some of my favorite. I'm not local, though, so I've never been here except for that event so I can't really comment on the service it's always great when they're hosting a hundred person lunch party .",2
"I will not shop here again. I, too, was excited to see a Spencers closer to my home as I had shopped in Mesa previously. Yes, they were quick to help when I walked in but service after the sale has been poor. I was misled on when my product would come in and now have to wait several more days. I am not a happy customer!",1
"Place sucks. Right when we went it, we showed out Restaurant.com gift certificate, and they rejected us because it was a weekend. No where on the gift certificate does it say anything about using it on the weekday. So there service isn't great, it was dead in there. no customers and they still didn't take our gift certificate. bad business to turn customers away especially when there's no one in there. Haven't even got to try the food. darn.",1
"I so love this Spa! I have been going there for over 4 years now and they always treat you so well nThey are a ""must try it ""!",2
"LOVE the Bellagio. The Garden they have there is changed seasonally and is always breath taking. The fountains of course are famous. I watch them languidly lick at the sky in the setting sunlight from my desk at home. There are great restaurants there and the amazing Cirque Du Soleil production, ""O "" has residency in the theatre. n nIt is always VERY busy and the valet can be jammed and is occasionally full. There IS security at the elevators so it is a bit of a pain for gentlemen seeking company, but in my professional opinion, the hassle is worth it. n nThe rooms are lovely and have great views and the 4 Star rating is due ONLY to the hassle of the valet and security. It deserves a 5 star rating as a hotel casino for the general population.",2

"Yes, this spa is probably pricey compared to other places, but it's in a nice hotel with a certain type of clientele I'm sure. But I guess maybe because I'm from LA and going to Glen Ivy and Burke Williams has spoiled me for the cheaper places? I expect not only the service but amenities as well. I want it to be a day of pampering. n nI took my bestie out for a spa day since she really needed one. I booked my massages and pedicures over the phone from LA. The lady that helped me on the phone gave me a few helpful tips. They have a ""couples massage package "" that has a scrub and a massage, but she told me how that one worked, and being that yes you get to be in the same room with your friend, mom, daughter, partner but one does the massage while the other has the scrub and then you switch. Yes it's a cheaper package, but if we get our own massages, they can set it up to be at the same time and adjoining rooms. Okay thanks for the heads up! n nI also had to move the day last minute due to some scheduling problems with my bestie, but we were able to easily reschedule luckily. n nWe arrived for our massages probably about 10 15 mins early. We were hoping for a little more time, but after going to lunch it just got a bit closer than planned. n nWe were greeted at the front desk and we were told to head downstairs and an attendant will help us once we got there. Once we were downstairs, the guy down there called up a female attendant so that she could show us around the women's spa area and gave us our slippers. n nI have to say, for someone who's been to quite a few nice spas, this was more or less par for the course. Extremely clean. Plenty of towels available. I did wish there was a hot tub in the area like in most spas, but there was multiple dressing areas with lockers that had robes waiting for us , showers, a sauna and a steam room, plus the waiting area that had an assortment of teas, coffee, water with cucumber or fruit or plain water plus a nuts dried fruit mix and a mix of chips for us to eat. I think there were also apples. n nWe waited for our massages which were 80 mins aromatherapy massages that were at a discount because they were the special promotional ones for the Thanksgiving holiday and our massage therapists came to get us. Come to find out now only were the rooms next to each other, it kinda was like having a ""couples "" massage anyways because the adjoining rooms actually had a door with sliding doors so it because one big room anyways. n nWe thoroughly enjoyed our massages and when we were leaving, our massage therapists were there for us with water and three roses a piece. It was very special. n nBack to the waiting area for our pedicures. We stopped by the sauna on the way to relax a bit since we had about 30 mins before we needed to be ""picked "" up by our pedicure ladies. n nOur pedicures were nice. Since it was also put as a ""couples "" pedi, we were sitting next to each other with a nice view of the pool area and the golf course. The ladies doing our pedicures were super nice and friendly. n nWe had a great time over all. Yeah, we could have paid less to a day spa elsewhere and a pedicure elsewhere, but we were there to have a spa experience, and we were able to have our nice girls day out.",2
"First off the only reason I am even giving 2 stars is the food was decent. Otherwise everything else from the second we walked in the door was a zero if possible. nWe made reservations with the owner on Friday for a table of 5 for Saturday evening. Got to the place, no record at all of the reservation. Hostess explains the owner text messages her the lists and he was off and had not done that. Ok, we got a table anyways after being quite annoyed that our reservation was never really taken. Our waitress eventually made her way over to our table to take our drink orders, 2 beers, and a mixed drink and some waters. The alcohol took a good 15 20 min to arrive, no biggie they were busy. At that point we placed our app and meals orders.20 min later our app arrived and we made another drink order. Half way through the app that took forever to show up our meals were plopped down in front of us with no sight of our waitress anywhere. About another 20 min goes by no one comes by to check if our food came out ok, and we still had not gotten our drink order, that we placed when our app arrived. We had to track down another waitress, who took our drink orders, again. And apologized for our waitress. All of a sudden Summer was at our table, with our drinks asking how everything is? Seriously? My 11 year year old sister had downed an entire 15oz rib eye by the time she ever came back to the table. We were all done eating, had no beverages throughout our entire meal and she never even apologized to us. Just acting as nothing had happened then tried to overcompensate at the end when she realized she had messed up. nOverall again food was decent, nothing I couldn't get somewhere else while not being treated like absolute crap. nWill never return, but maybe it was a bad night, with a bad server, but with no apologies or acknowledgement of screwing up at all, they messed up their chance with me.",1
"What happened to this place? I think I have more guns then they do. It's always been a tourist trap, but they use to have very reasonable prices for guns and ammo. Not anymore",1
"I had to write a review of my beloved Earth Fare, especially no that there is so much competition in the area, and this store really needs some props. n nRecently renovated, this Earth Fare has added a great new, fresh bread counter, and the best charcuterie section I have seen in the city. n nSome of my faves that you should definitely try n nSoups Thai Chicken, Butternut squash and apple, cchicken and dumplings to die for. I tried similar soups at the ""other "" store Earth Fare's smell so much fresher the others had this weird fake smokey smell and are much more pure tasting. n nMock chicken salad I'm not opposed to regular chicken, but I LOVE their mock chicken everything buffalo wing ""nuggets, "" and their mock chicken salad is faboosh! n nFish they have some of the most beautiful and fresh fish. Often, they have several types of salmon, and they are beautiful! n nCharcuterie they have a hand cranked, Italian slicer that gives you paper thin slices of the most beautiful salamis, prosciutto perfect with a glass of wine, a baguette and a hunk of delicious cheese. n nI agree with the others, definitely sign up for their online and phone specials. I recently got lobster tails 2 for 8. You can't beat that!",2
"Wow, just got my car back after having an alignment done, and could not believe how courteous Gerry the store manager was. Also very professional. With the warranty I got, I can go back any time within a year to have the alignment done any time or as many times as I want. Great prices too. This will have to be my new go to spot from now on.",2

"Okay I used to love this place when they were located on 16th street, so what happened? The new ""diner "" looks more like a closed down Asian restaurant than diner. When they moved locations they lost the diner atmosphere and luster. Not only that but the food isn't the same, seems that maybe some recipes have changed. I work at a restaurant, over by the old location, and used to tell people, who wanted breakfast, to go to joes and enjoy some awesome biscuits and gravy. Sad to say I can no longer refer people over there.",1
"I didn't expect to have to visit Banner Thunderbird again so soon after the birth of my son on 7 16 but an emergency arose that caused us to have to return with him. The pediatric ER was FANTASTIC. They made us feel at ease, were prompt with their care of our baby, and provided answers quickly with what our next steps were. n nUltimately, we had to stay overnight and stayed in the pediatric unit with our baby so here is part 2 of our visit. n nThe Peds unit is OUTSTANDING. Our nurses, Robyn and Jamie, were kind, understanding, and very professional. We were treated like friends rather than just patients. Our pediatricians during our stay was professional, nurturing, and didn't allow us to beat ourselves up over our baby's issue. But the best part of our visit was our tech, Mary. She treated our baby like he was one of her own kids and she treated us like royalty while we were there. n nThough I'm not looking forward to having to go back to the hospital, I know that when I do have to go back, I will receive excellent, high quality, nurturing care from Banner Thunderbird Medical Center.",2
"Fab happy hour. make dinner out of it! 4 rolls , 2 salads a lobster wonton app with a divine sauce to go with. all about 40. including a couple drinks. nYellow tail roll was my least fav. just had a weird taste. and I cant do sushi with a taste that isnt fresh. umm sorry not worth it. but everything else was right on.so I didnt send back. nWaiter kind of complacent. I hate my salads to come seconds before my other choices. nDecor I adore!",2
"For around 25, you can get six pounds of food. I know because I weighed our bag. Pearl Wok To GO is conveniently located to my home and work, great price to value ratio, and good flavors. Particularly the won ton soup! n nLemon chicken is spot on in flavor, and perfectly crispy because they poked holes in the box lid. Good attention to detail! n nMoo Shu pork is decent but not my favorite dish, served with pancakes that are reminiscent of tortillas. Healthy seeming dish with lots of cabbage, mushrooms, and other veggies. Menu also offers steamed veggie and protein options for those seeking healthy choices. n nBut the won ton soup. Lord. The 5 bowl is huge, has 6 plump and stuffed won tons, but the broth is the star! Perfectly savory, probably packed with MSG, topped with a ton of shredded green onion. Perfect when you're under the weather.",2
"All the 5 star reviews are dead on accurate.

"Whoa. So I wrote a review complaining about Greystone being an annoyance in the neighborhood and YELP removed it obviously because the Greystone people complained. I have eaten there and it is just okay, not bad, not great. Okay. Yelp said my review was not helpful or relevant, but how is it not helpful to tell patrons of a place that the restaurant does not care about the neighbors where it is located or that the food isn't great. Constantly we call on Saturdays about the loud noise from this place and they do nothing. So I am just expressing my opinion. You can go there and enjoy their just okay food and listen to their super loud music that upsets all the neighbors. Feel free.",1
"The food here is pretty good. There are a lot of toppings for your salad and you can build a pretty good salad. The premium toppings aren't really all that premium though and cost a decent amount more. There is a decent selection of soups, but they only usually have a few other hot items. The whole point is the salad though and it's really good.",2
"My husband is a huge fan of cheesesteaks and I never really have been. After eating at this place, I can finally understand why he loves cheesesteaks so much. n nWe came here after reading the reviews on Yelp, of course. It's a small place with sufficient seating outdoor seating also . Very clean inside. The employees are friendly and do not rush you with your order. n nAfter eating at a different cheesesteak place, I had become weary of ordering whiz on my sandwich. My husband bit the bullet and decided to try it, however, and after taking a bite of his, I wish I had did the same! Their whiz is not that crap you find in a jar on the shelf in Walmart. It has flavor and it compliments their cheesesteaks amazingly! I had my cheesesteak with mozzarella or provolone whichever is on the menu. it's been a couple months since trying this place and I'm just now finding time to write up the review . The cheesesteak is delicious by itself, but I definitely would have liked the whiz better. These sandwiches are HUGE. Glad I ordered the smaller one, because there's no way I could have eaten all of mine by myself. Considering the cost, the portions are great! Their fries were awesome, as well. Next time, we'll try the sweet potato variety. Never been a huge fan of them, because nobody can seem to make them taste good, but this place won't let me down, I'm sure! n nIf you like cookies grab a cookie from there! They seem to be fresh baked and made in house. I could be wrong about that, but either way they are damn good! n nWill be going back when we wander out that way again. Will definitely be a staple destination spot anytime we find ourselves needing to go to IKEA, since it's nearby. ",2
"When I drop 180 on dinner, I kind of expect a few things. n nI want my waitress to pay attention to my order, get things right, and not try to disappear off for a smoke break if someone hesitates for a moment while placing their order. n nWhen I'm told that you have the best sushi on the strip, and said sushi contains a tempura fried shrimp, I expect it not to be soggy with oil which clearly hasn't been changed since the place was built. n nWhen I order the Peking Duck, I expect the legs not to be burned to in edibility.

I expect to get enough little pancakes to make several duck rolls out of a whole duck, and not be charged an extra 5 for a few more of them. n nI expect a Philly roll to use FRESH salmon, not the smoked shit I get in bulk at Costco. n nWhen I pay out the ass for dinner, I expect to be wowed. n nI was not.",1

"this review is gonna be all over the place cuz there's a restaurant, a club, and a lounge. the best thing about this place is the restaurant! too bad i was not more hungry so i could finish that fuckn meatball. that damn thing was the size of my head! i shared it with lobster bisque and veggie sides. everything was sooo good! some of the best i've had in vegas. all very rich tho butter! cream! olive oil! so very filling. it's best to wear a bubble dress P just get wine with the food, there's no alcohol in their cocktails. shit is like kool aid. they even come in a kool aid pitcher if u want a pitcher. the service was awesome. we had like 10 waiters come up to us. apparently they all were clamoring to get us plates and water. we pretty much got asked twice for everything.ha ha. they were all good looking and fun so it was cool n nclub is 2 stars. it looked too crowded on the main floor and the music was just regular cheesy dance music. u know, like miley cyrus. n nwe were gonna bounce but the first floor lounge had some bad ass hip hop. so i had to stay for just one song.and then ooooh one more! and then i ended up just staying period. only a handful of people were dancing here thre but i dint give a fuck! music made me wanna move . wish people were groovin to it too tho.",2
"New place with a lot of kinks to work out! nFirst off having the entrance at the far right side of the place is just wrong. I am not sure how long Biscuits has been open, but it is obvious that they are struggling with a new restaurant concept here in Ahwatukee nWe were greeted promptly on the way in, and shown to a booth in the front foyer that seems like the rear of the place. The overall colors of the place were uninviting, dismal, and drab. Then things started to get interesting. nI asked if I could get just one of their ""Champion Pancakes "" on the side, as I did not need 2 of them. I was told that I could not, since it was different from just the regular side pancake.whatever! I would have paid for the upgrade. Nevertheless I ordered the Champion Pancakes 8.79 , just 2 pancakes with huge boat of syrup, orange wheel, and kale. My friend ordered an ""Omelet "" with jalapenos added in, and requested her hashbrowns extra crispy. Coffee and water were the beverages of choice. nMy pancakes were awful. They were very thin, yet totally doughy and undercooked. I am not in the habit of sending things back, but since they were new I felt obligated to let them know. I changed my order to Bacon Eggs. This was brought out in a timely manner. I told our server that he should suggest the Biscuits Breakfast option. That includes hashbrowns, biscuit, eggs, and choice of bacon, ham, or sausage. I just received bacon eggs. Yes I know that is what I ordered, but being a fan of bacon and eggs, one usually has the option for full meal. I was charged for a side of eggs, side of bacon, and my coffee. I did receive a biscuit with my meal and it was nothing special. It tasted like a regular Bisquick recipe. nMy friend received the omelet minus the hashbrowns, and was told that they were still working on making them crispy. The food should arrive together! Let it sit in the window wherever and bring it out all together. Needless to say the omelet was so so, very basic and hardly any cheese. The biscuit The signature name of this restaurant never arrived with the omelet! How does one forget to include their Namesake on orders? nOverall I don't think that I will be going back anytime soon. There are other places out there that are much better. For being locally owned and family run, a breakfast chain is much better. Biscuits is nothing special.",1
"Wow! We have driven by this place plenty of times but never stopped in. The food was, to say the least, very impressive for a strip mall restaurant. nMy wife tried the chicken piccata, it was very fresh, flavorful and tender. nI had the Penne pepperonata. It was very good, lots of flavor and a good sized portion I had to take about 1 3 of it home and I'm not exactly a small man . nThe waiter was very pleasant and attentive, we will most definitely return and also recommend it to friends.",2
"ok, i realize we got our room off bookit.com for a good price, but this room was unacceptable. looked nice, clean, comfy bed, but it was so noisy we couldn't sleep. i think we had the worst location in the place.first floor, west wing, directly at the end of the hallway T off the west wing bar. at one point, i opened the front door to ask the party in the hall to quiet down, then realized they were outside our bedroom window. it sounded like someone was dropping rocks in the room above us. earplugs should come with this room. better yet, they should turn it into a second west wing public restroom. n nwe loved centrifuge and the grand buffet. if it weren't for the noise, i'd be leaving 4 stars.",1

Haven't had a margarita this bad since my only visit to Salty Senorita. Ordered 2 Palomas which call for fresh squeezed lime and grapefruit juice. When my better half asked for a shot of beer to calm the tartness the bartender suggested adding more of the grapefruit soda.What? Total sour belly result and 28 later a lesson learned. Always disappointing when you know you could have made a better drink yourself at home.,1

Service was friendly, attentive and quick. n nShout out to Donut Tyme next door.",1
"I live very close by to this Zoe's and go here a lot. A LOT. Like, embarrasingly a lot. And it's always for lunch, and I always order to go, and I always order the same exact thing, the same exact way Greek salad, no olives, no potato salad, extra red onions. I used to have a problem where I'd get home and find chicken added to it a no no for a vegetarian like me , but I haven't had that issue in about a year. Nonetheless, I check it while I'm still there every time to make sure. The salad is big and tasty especially without those nasty olives or unnecessary potato salad glob at the bottom , and I feel like it's pretty healthy and low calorie. The service is nice and pretty efficient, even during weekday lunch rush when it's a real challenge to find parking and maneuver around the lot without getting hit. They don't even embarrass me about coming so often and ordering the same exact thing, haha. The one thing I can say as a critique they could be a bit more consistent on their salads. Sometimes there is a ton of something, like lettuce or feta, and other times it's challenging to find it at all. This place is solid.",2

This place was ok food. now the negative they sat us next to a bucket on the floor that was catching water dripping from the roof. The water had a terrible stench.

It's a newer building but the restaurant was DIRTY.,1

Rio's management is horrible. We were place in a suite that's above a restaurant and we can smell fry foods coming out of the restaurant vent. The worst part is the manager doesn't think it's a big deal. All our clothes smell like fried foods. I will never book a room at this dump again.,1
"It's so great to find one restaurant that's NOT a chain. I feel so bad because they are always empty inside when we get there. The chips and salsa are tasty, the food has always been good. I've been there twice, with two other people both times and everyone in my party has always enjoyed their meal. Their menu is large and varied and they do have an ""A la carte "" section. Another great thing that I just discovered last night, they have a sweet happy hour with 1 9oz. margaritas, that's right, you heard me, A DOLLAR! The service has always been friendly and helpful, albeit the gentleman who served us last night didn't have much to say, but he seemed just shy more than anything else. It's clean, friendly, tasty and cheap. Go give it a try! Help support something other than the Applebees, Taco Bell, Panda Express and the countless other chain restaurants that are ubiquitous in Ahwatukee!",2

At the edge of a strip mall, visible from the road. nSeems like a great way to lure 'em in. nAnd the table and benches outside are a nice touch. n nI didn't have the Gelati but it did remind me of something we used to get years ago.

"Oooooh noooo. Had such high expectations and was so disappointed. Loved the movie Serendipity and the outdoor pink patio looked so cool and fun that they suckered us into coming. n nOur story. we came in for a late lunch. Right upfront the waitress mentioned that it will be a while before we get our food because they are busy. Once she left, I looked around only to notice that they were only half filled to capacity since the majority of their seating is outside and half of the outdoor tables were empty Go figure. n nWe ordered an appetizer, salad, and we were going to split the hamburger. nThe appetizer arrived, and the hamburger arrived. salad never made it. Once we finished eating, we finally caught the waitress and asked about our salad. she apologized and said she would take it off the bill. Take it off the bill? Wow. how generous of her considering we never received it! n nIt was comical because when she said that, she was acting as if she was going to do us a huge favor by not charging us for that salad. n nIn addition, she had no sense of personal space.not sure if she was hard at hearing or what, but when we were ordering, she was leaning down right in our faces. It was very annoying. n nAbout the food. bland! Our hamburger was dry, the soda was flat and seriously, the cookie dough sundae could be made at home and it would have tasted much better than theirs. Seriously overpriced. Months before, I tried the Carl's Jr. hamburger version of what we ordered here and let me tell you, Carl's Jr. was a 10 on a 1 to 10 scale and this was a 1. n nThere are so many delicious restaurants to choose from in Vegas so I am shocked as to how little they care about good service and food here. n nI think it is a good idea to look at Yelp before going into a restaurant because if you see the average is 3 out of 5 stars, its safe to assume that nearly half the people weren't satisfied.

It didn't come with the same nasty red sauce you get on enchiladas elsewhere, and it definitely had a unique flavor. n nThe best, however, was their cilantro soup. Amazing!

"My second time at the Wynn drew much dissatisfaction and criticism. After my first trip there a couple of years ago, I absolutely loved it! Of course, that was my pre signature days. We were also there to enjoy the holiday season and 200 bucks for this room was nice and i liked it a lot. BUT after experiencing MGM's Signature a few times in the last few months, I can't help but not want to return to the Wynn again. n nYes, everything is luxurious. but the service that comes with it is sub par! I also hate dealing with attitude when I'm spending so much money gambling at your casino only to realize that your comp system sucks as you're catered to only high rollers. and 4000 points a day 3 a point doesn't mean crap to my host. I would have much rather pay for my own room at the Signature and get comped at the wonderful restaurants there. Never mind the free room here. n nWe arrived to an overcrowded lobby past midnight everyone and their gramma was trying to get into the club and was either obnoxious or drunk. Checking in was relatively painless tho' I wish he would have asked if I preferred a lower or higher floor, closer farther away from the elevator. No it usually wouldn't matter but it got to be a pain in the mornings sharing tight elevator trips with 48 other people trying to get to the spa level or check out . taking too long to get to the casino floor. Yes, the Signature has gotten me spoiled. n nThe pool is too small for that many people. the drinks much too expensive tho' the mango daquiri is excellent even at that price Service is slow but only because the place is huge and there are too few of them. n nI'm not gonna' spend any more money at the Wynn.

"Ok, so I haven't ever been IN the store, but I called them to ask a question and it was the most frustrating phone call. I called to find out how much it would cost to have a diaper bag cleaned. The lady who answered the phone kept YELLING into the phone ""HELLO! HELLO! What? I don't know what that is? What so you want? "" I finally had to explain what a diaper bag is. Instead of giving me a price, she asked me what kind of diaper bag it was and how much I paid for the bag. I understand the kind of bag may have some bearing on it, but she doesn't need to know how much I purchased the bag for.

"The Wing King cafe does not mess around. As others mentioned, it isn't much of a restaurant. Its somewhat of an eyesore actually, but that kinda adds to the charm. No frills about it.

This place has some of the best wing's I've ever had. 10 bazillion times better then wild wing cafe. In fact I think wild wing sucks. Here, wings are perfectly fried, and juicy. Without sauce they also taste great. They have a multitude, I mean multitude of sauces. As Julie R mentioned, go with the sampler. n nThe only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't frequent it too often and it's out in the boonies in comparison to my location.

It was neat to be able to build your own. n nHowever, half way through our meals, we had enough. The food was way to greased up. We all ended up getting sick after.

"Wow! WHAT A Waste of money. They should change the name from Le Reve to Le Boring. This was a complete knock off and wannabe of the show ""O "" cirque d soleil. Yes I know the same creator of that show. I watched pretty much every show in Vegas except for the shit hole ones you find in old Las Vegas. This show might as well been in the Stratosphere. I mean give me a break 100 per ticket I am glad that I got the cheap seats, that were in front row where you get wet from the water. If the water didn't splash on me I would have slept through the whole show. Same oh crap people swinging around doing flips and stunts. I have seen this a dozen times before. I am very dissapointed in Steve Wynn. I would have thought that he would have a better show in his fabulous Casino. I would rather take my money and play Casino War with it instead of spending it on a boring boring show. Maybe thats why he put this show in his Casino, so that everyone who leaves the show when its done will gamble, and try to win their money back after they wasted it on this show.",1
Overprice on everything. Try double tapping and you'll see how fast they come to you. A place for tourist.,1
"We went during lunch time in the middle of the day to beat any rush or big lines. Prices were ok, about 21 a person. The food was very good, obviously the quality is top notch for the price. Im sure they have all the very expensive seafood for dinner so there was toned down menu for lunch. They had great steak fajitas, I ate about 10 of them, their raviolis were awesome too. Soups were average at best and service was decent, they cleared plates pretty quickly. Overall a great meal, but maybe a bit too expensive for a basic lunch menu, i dunno maybe Im just cheap.",2
"Bei einer Radtour vor ein paar Wochen den Kofler ausprobiert. n nGegessen habe ich Bibelsk u00e4s mit Kartoffeln. Gute fand ich, dass Petersilie und Zwiebeln getrennt wurden und man das so selbst dosieren kann. Die Kart u00f6ffelchen waren ausgewachsene Grumbeere. Zierlich war da nix. Die Portion reichlich, der Preis fair. n nDie Karte an sich ist u00fcbrigens riesig, was meiner Erfahrung fast nie positiv ist.

"The food here is awesome! This Location is convenient off of US 60. I eat here often when seeing a movie next door at AMC Mesa Grand 24. I wanted to give this location 5 stars, but could not because I have not always had good service. The service quality depends on when you eat at this location. Usually the service is fast friendly, but if you come here when the high school kids are working, service usually is ok at best, if even that good. Overall very good except for a couple of times of rude service from the teenagers. I reported the rude teenagers to the manager on another visit and he said he would look into the situation. Service lately has been excellent.",2
"Eno Vino is what a wine bar is supposed to be good atmosphere, a wide selection of interesting wines, and fun food. While a few of the menu items are only average, most of the things I have tried are well above average. I would come back here again just to have the truffle fries, let alone a chance to take another shot at the cheese board!",2
"My girlfriends and I found this place on Yelp and called up to make an appointment for the 3 of us. When we called, we asked how much it was for a session and were told 38, and asked us how we found out about them. When we said Yelp, they said that it will be 34 hour. n nWhen we got there, we were ushered into a dimly lit room with comfortable armchairs to sit in. A big wooden tub is brought out with a plastic bag lined and filled with hot water to soak our feet in. n nMy masseuse was Anna who immediately went to work on my back and shoulders. After about 10 mins on my upper back, I felt myself relax and slump over the cushions she had placed on my lap. n nI've had Chinese foot massage before but they've always hurt me so badly I couldn't go about my daily duties for a few days. There was none of this here. Anna exerted enough pressure, yet, was not torturing me with pain. n nMy friend wanted a 75 minute treatment so all 3 of us did as well. We had a good 30 minutes of back, neck and shoulder massage and then she moved onto your head, scalp and ears before doing the arms, hands and fingers. When that was finished she started working on my feet and toes. I actually fell asleep can you believe it? I've NEVER fallen asleep during one of these before. n nShe then massaged my legs and then laid 3 ottomans together so we could lay on it face down so she could work on my back. Throughout the treatment, I was drinking the herbal tea they had provided I suggest you do this because it will make you go and pee to flush out all the toxins in your body. n nWhen it was all over, I stood up and was wobbly. I lost my balance slightly because I was so relaxed. n nI'm going to give them 5 stars for the treatment, but am taking off a star because I didn't realize until later, they never gave us the Yelp discount. We received 15 minutes of extra treatment and were charged 48. We were told the Yelp discount would make the one hour treatment 34, so an extra 15 minutes should not cost 14 extra dollars. n nStill, I will return here again when we go to Vegas next and I hope Anna is still there when I return! It's so rare to find a good Chinese food massage person lord knows I've tried!",2
"Folks, this was the worse italian food I've even eaten. Maybe it was a bad day. I really don't know. It was sooooo dark inside, we could hardly read the menu. All in all, it won't happen again for us. And I love Italian food!",1
"Wow, the food here is horrible and the servers are lacking in every way possible. n nFirst off the food.disgusting, flavorless underwhelming. I had the BBQ pork sandwich and it literally tasted like dirt, the cfc was bland and the gravy tasted like un cooked flour. The pickles were actually descent, but the chips and queso tasted like nally's chili, which isn't a compliment. n nThe server was clueless on any question we asked. She over charged us on the food and drinks. n nThis lace is worthless in my opinion, and I hope it goes away.",1
Ever wonder how your insides looked? Here is a chance! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I've been waiting to check out this place and never had a chance to and I am glad I finally did! It was amazing! Words cannot describe how great it is! Wish I can capture pictures but no photography is allowed! Definitely worth the money! Will definitely check it out again!,2
"Yuck. That was a wasted groupon, at least I did not pay full price for this place. I will never return to this place. Slow service, food was bland, and was way overpriced. n nThe only reason this place gets 2 stars is because of the interior. I think the space itself creates a nice atmosphere. I had the Agnolotti Boa, a ravioli dish. Unfortunately for 16 this left me hungry and craving some flavor. I appreciate the use of fresh and organic ingredients, but this just lacked everything. n nThere are better options in neighboring Scottsdale or even in Tempe. Skip this place.",1
"Wife's food good. Mine fair. Waitress bad ! Parked in adjacent parking lot , waitress to validate parking ticket, didn't and couldn't leave parking lot. This sucks! Can't even buy ticket ! Had to back and get ticket token to leave! Not going back!",1
"A little place squirreled away near the Paris Bally's crossover. Seek it out and you will be rewarded! n nThe decor is beautiful and is more effective if you're there early. The candles, water, and subdued ambiance are quite effective in combination. n nThe food is a win in every way. Portions are on the large side, well prepared, and delicious! n nI started off with the summer rolls from the Vietnamese side of the menu. They were very well prepared fresh and crispy, with grilled pork, mint, and rice noodles inside. n nI had the Drunken Man's Noodles for the entr u00e9e they were flavorful, spicy, and full of meat and vegetables. I can highly recommend this dish have them spice it the way you like it it's a real crowd pleaser. n nWhen all was said and done, it was about 31 with drinks 5 for a big thai iced tea . That's pretty cheap for Vegas.",2
"Except the tortilla soup which was excellent, everything else absolutely sucked! As a person who appreciates and enjoys food and tries out new restaurants all the time specifically in Las Vegas, I am pretty surprised to see a restaurant in a great location and with a famous owner be so bad. n nThe medium filet minion was burned on the outside and dry like cotton on the inside. The scallops were way too salty and dry as well. The wild mushrooms and the Au Gratin potatoes were just terrible more like Friday's . I guess we should have known how the night was going to turn out after eating the tasteless bread and butter. Perhaps they had the wrong people in the kitchen on a slow Tuesday night in Vegas because the restaurant was only a fifth full but the service was slooooow! n nAnyway, they took the Fillet off the bill since we did not eat it but it stated on the bill that ""customer did not like "". I would be happy with that if I ate say an ethnic dish and I was not appreciative of the flavors or something like that. But how the hell do you screw up a Filet Mignon in a steakhouse? And then put it on the customer? Really? n nHey Eva, at least take responsibility and add a line on the bill that says ""our food sucked ""!",1
First time here in almost 10 years. Sammiches are still huge and easily shared by two. Freshly cooked fries are good but most folks seem to go for the sweet potato variety. n nFall is the perfect time to drop by and sit outside. But grabbing to go is good as well. Be sure to grab extra napkins!,2
"I get my hair done there and I love it. I have curly hair and have had more bad haircuts than I can count. I know every time I go I will leave happy and beautiful. The salon itself is gorgeous, and the staff and stylists are professional and friendly. I drive a long way every month to go to Haute Fringe, and it is totally worth the time and gas it takes. I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else!",2
"I have been having my 2004 Volvo C 70 serviced at the dealer since I bought it 9 years ago. Great service, but at a high price. I needed control arms and decided to shop the job. I found this place on Yelp and gave it a shot. Very glad I did. Marshall did a great job and saved me about 200 bucks. Very thorough and very informative. Next time, and I am hoping it will be far in the future, he gets the work. Check him out Volvo owners. Well worth the drive.",2
one of our favorite places to stay in LV,2
Came here a couple weeks ago because my friend was having an event there. I have to say it was a little difficult to find. I guess I just assumed it was a stand alone building but was surprised to find it in group of other buildings. Tons of beer on tap which is a huge plus! I tried a few different ones but needless to say I can't remember which ones! I didn't try any of the food but I heard it was ok. They also have a fire pit out front which was cool to sit around towards the end of the night.,2
"If you were getting this hotel for free, it would be alright to stay here. But if you are paying, consider other places. n nIt is at the north end of the strip and it is a far walk drive to get places. The rooms were alright, but nothing special. The casino is old and just depressing. n nIf you are 40 I am sure you would enjoy this place, it is full of the older crowd. If you are young, you will hate this place as much as I did.",1
"i love bulk store! n nthis one ain't bad at all. they have a wide range of stuff including plushies for the kids or those still young at heart. its not the best bulk store in town as certain things are pricier if you shop around but it is pretty convenient being next to the market. n nplace is extremely clean and feel spacious. it doesn't have the lovely smell of anatol or the colorful look of oscar though which makes it boring. it lacks personality but still, a decent store to go to when one is in the market.",2
"Went there last week. While the food was good, I was hungry less tha 2 hours later. Will not be back.",1
"We didn't know where to eat in Vegas I know there are so many places to eat , and my brother in law suggested this place. A little drive from the strip but WOW was it worth it. n nWe started off with the wonton style tortilla chips. These aren't your normal tortilla chips, but they come with salsa and guacamole. Our party ordered bulgogi burritos, bulgogi tacos and chicken chow fun. All were amazing. The bulgogi burritos are a MUST! The bulgogi is cooked well and is complemented nicely with the sweet and hot sauce. Kristina ordered the bulgogi tacos and they were better than any bulgogi tacos that we've had. Make sure to try the bulgogi if you go. You won't regret it. n nThe biggest plus of this place is the PRICE! For 4 plates our dinner was under 30! Yeah, 30 big ones and we were all stuffed after. Totally worth the drive from the strip but be forewarned, this place is small. The staff is extremely friendly and kept checking up on us throughout our meal. 5 stars all around!",2
"One of my favorite restaurants ever ! my wife and I have been to this location and the one in the Bahamas and there is always something new and delicious. We had the SOUTHWESTERN SPICE CHICKEN SKEWERS and they were great and flavorfull, I had the MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and my wife had the ANCHO CHILE HONEY GLAZED SALMON and both dishes where GREAT , i wished i would of remember my waitress name she was great too all i know is that she was from Argentina and she recommended a really great tasting Sauvignon Blanc. Cant wait to go back , Maybe the NY location next",2
Great happy hour prices and man how I love me some Pork Canitas tacos,2
"Slowest place ever. waited over an hour for appetizers. My buddy went to loco patron next door and got tacos before the apps came out. He showed up about 30 mins after we got here too. First app that showed up was an app we put it after the complete order was place. Their excuse was that its a very easy app to make. He then went and got another set of tacos before the entrees came out. Finished eating the second set of tacos and ""fast app "" still isn't out. Entrees came out at room temp not even hot as if it was fresh off the grill ect. Very very very disappointed if I could give no stars I would give no stars. Still sitting here waiting for the app to come out that's suppose to be a ""fast app "" ridiculous!",1
"Food was excellent,cocktail we're good our cocktail waiter Michelle F not too good a little too much attitude,she have me attitude when I wanted my tap transfer to the table. nBe back for the food and the restaurant but I will stay at the bar before dinner next time",1
Love our ballpark.the screen clearer and more amazing this season. The team is this year can be quite frustrating but I am a die hard fan.They have a lot of young talent and will improve. nThey offer a good variety of restaurants and have enough bathrooms so we don't have to wait in long lines. nThe staff is friendly and helpful. nGreat entertainment for reasonable price!,2
"Definitely the power lunch spot in the Biltmore area. The steaks are great but there are other options, even for the vegetarian. n nVery good service and while a little pricey a good place for a business meeting or a special evening.",2
"The wonders of CreditOne.My account got closed, without a reason that I knew of nCall 1 I try to speak to the person but he was just simply not understanding and too stuck in his script to help . so I ask to reopen the account online so I can try to fix whatever needs fixing. he says he cant .so I ask for a supervisor.he says the supervisor would say the same. I told him I need a supervisor.and if only a supervisor can open it why not transfer me. I repeated myself until he transferred me. during the hold.the phone disconnected. awesome nCall 2 I tell that rep I was waiting for a supervisor on my last call but their line disconnected.he made me go through the whole thing all over again. I asked for a supervisor.he refused a few times.then finally transferred me. while trying to tell my whole thing AGAIN.the supervisor put me on hold.and disconnected.GREAT! nCall 3 I again nicely tell the new rep that I was talking to a supervisor and the call disconnected. He says that he cannot get one because they are all in a meeting.uhm.no.they werent. he kept repeating himself and said someone will call me back in 72 hours.I said I was JUST speaking to a supervisor so thats impossible.he repeated himself more.so I decided to hang up that time nCall 4 I ask AGAIN to speak to a supervisor.said my spiel quickly since I know what Im saying.he transferred me right away.guess that meeting only lasted 5 min huh? Spoke to a supervisor .he said he couldnt do anything without my CHECKING account info.I told him I was driving and so far no one has mentioned that. I said I need it open tonight so I can send a payment.he said ""I can only open it for you tonight if you have the checking account.call back when you decide to have it in front of you "" .and hung up. REALLY? nCall 5 I give the girl the checking info and she said it will take 7 10 days. HELL? My payment is due in 7 days.why cant I do it over the phone? Cause they will charge me 19.95. So.I said the supervisor I just spoke to said it would be tonight. so I asked for another supervisor.she put me on hold.came back.said no one is available.and was about to disconnect but I said I rather wait now then days to be called back. and currently.I am on hold. nI have never ever closed a credit card but once I pay off this one.it is being CLOSED. nTHEY.SUCK.PERIOD.",1
"They are always so helpful at this store! I would highly recommend all of their services. I have used them for shipping, packing and printing. I also noticed that they do printing on stretched canvas which I am really excited to try! Two big thumbs up!",2
"As a past guest over 3 years ago, I was attracted to the HRH's lower rates for this particular Summer weekend, and the convenient location for REHAB on Sunday, so I booked a 3 Night stay Fri Mon . However, during our stay, my friend and I realized why the rates are so low compared to the other, newer hotels in Vegas. n nFirst of all, I was surprised to see that the cleanliness and maitenance of the rooms have deteriorated since my prior visits, and nothing has been done to upgrade or match other nicer hotels. The rooms and bathrooms are dirtier than I remember, and our particular room smelled like smoke. Furthermore, none of our shampoo conditioner lotion convenience items were replaced at all on 2 of the 3 days during our stay. n nI used to come here in the past to hang at the 'Circle Bar' located in the center of the casino area.and it used to be a great 'meet' spot for women, however, women are hanging out at other hotels esp. Cosmopolitan and Encore now, even when not going to clubs, etc. HRH is a ""sword fight "" now for simply hanging out. REHAB is pretty much the same from what I remember, definitely NOT better or improved, and I've come to realize that the actual pool iteself sucks compared to the other newer hotels and their pool party options now. After spending time at the pool parties outside REHAB, you will get the same thing at the Palms, Wet Republic, Encore, Cosmopolitan's Marquis, etc., with a contemporary and hip scene, as well as state of the art stereo and almost concert like experiences. REHAB used to be THE place, but is mediocre at best now. If you've been in the past, try another spot from what I hear, you're better off. We only went to REHAB because we thought as a guest we would possibly receive preferential treatment compared to Non Guests. NOT! I realize being a guy I would have to wait in line, but girls staying at the hotel also had to wait in line and pay 75 cover just to use the pool on Sunday. It's 60 before noon I think. There is NO benefit to you at all as a guest at HRH in getting into REHAB. No special line or rates, etc. n nFinally, during our automated 'Quick' checkout via the room tv, we discovered there was a 20 day ""Resort Fee "" added to our weekend hotel bill. Upon calling the front desk, it was explained to me that this is a MANDATORY extra charge given to every room for WiFi Internet access, etc., even if you don't use it, or didn't bring a laptop in the first place! Staff on phone stated that this was explained to me in detail upon check in, and since I was the one checking us in that weekend sober I might add , I assure you that it was NOT explained at all. n nThese are the little EXTRA 'bend over' charges that were hidden upon booking room at HRH, and I will NOT be staying here in the future. There are better options in Vegas now elsewhere, you will see if you don't already know.",1
Third time I've stayed here in the past several years the rooms are looking more run down everytime. definitely needs to be updated and have some maintenance done to bring it back up to how it was when It was the Aladdin. neverything else in the public areas and the staff was fine,2
"Left Vegas and ended up at a mall called Townsquare. I had no idea where I was going and ended up parking in a weird parking spot by vallet and saw this place. The name and outside was so cute and as soon as I saw ""shakes and beer "" I had to go in. When I went in I saw 2 other customers and a very flustered manager I would assume at the register. I only ordered a shake because it looked like a storm was moving in and I had a long drive back to California. I ordered the Triple Chocolate Shake which was over 5. I instantly thought of a quote from Pulp Fiction. Anyway I sat down and waited for my shake. The manager was very all over the place she was in the middle of taking someone's order and an employee came in and she went straight into conversation with her and totally left the customer waiting. Behind the counter where my shake should have been made no one was doing anything. The waiter in there was socializing and not doing much of anything else. Finally I went up to the manager letting her know I had ordered a MILKSHAKE over 15 minutes ago. She then told the waiter and he looked at the order screen and said ""oh yeah you're right "" then he went on to aruge with another employee about if I wanted it to go or not. Then a girl yelled to me across the restaurant asking if I wanted it to go. The shake wasn't that good and was about 12oz in a plastic cup! Very unprofessional and I am very disappointed and probably won't be back.",1
"Finally something in Tempe that doesn't think all customers are drunken, poor college students. Not that I'm making fun of them, I was one of them. and when I was I also didn't really care about the quality and overall taste of food. n nThai Basil is fairly small, often cramped, somewhat noisy, but always tasty. They are one of the best in town for tofu dishes. n nThe curry dishes are also quite tasty. Overall, a great find in Tempe.",2
Pumi's ok. The greeter was cool. I think he was the chef. I didn't like the dark ambiance. Service was not that great. Was a lil slow than usual. Food portion was not as gd as Sushi Bay. I prefer Sushi Bay.,1
"I had a decent time here the other night while visiting Scottsdale. It was a Thursday, 2 for 1 drinks til midnight, but I thank my good time to the company I was in and the lovely people watching the crowd here provided. n nLet's start with problem numero uno The place is located in a Safeway shopping center. no joke! So get your groceries and come shake your booty all in one trip Now I know Scottsdale has a rep, and to be honest, I do enjoy surrounding myself in that scene once in a while but seriously could not get over the fact that while sitting on their ""posh "" patio, I was watching the cart boy rounding up stray shopping carts. Location location location, this place fails miserably at that. n nThe drinks were okay. call me crazy but I actually prefer to taste some alcohol in my martini. n nAnd the decor in the place was a joke! You walk in to a big open room. think Rocky Pointe spring break style back in HS when you went to those 20 all you can drink parties. All that was missing was the video crew recording the raunchy females, cougars in this case. The chairs seating in the car were cheap looking and overall reminded me of Ikea. n nOn the plus side, it was pretty busy but chill enough were my friends and I could enjoy each others company without being knocked into by others. n nFor wanting a chill night with great people watching this place is great. But please get over your posh sophisticated attitude because you are far from it and the place would actually have more potential if you realized it. My favorite part of the night. A cougar with a much older sugar daddy. She walks away from daddy to be swept away my 20someyhing boy toy, only to turn around, and hang her purse on daddy before heading to the dance floor to grind on the boy. Poor daddy was left outside, purse and all, looking like a fool. Made for decent people watching. I sadly left and don't know the outcome of this. If you were there last night and saw these scene please do tell ",1
"They have the WORST ordering system in the world. n nYou have to place your order on a paper bag. Plan on an extra 5 10 minutes for everyone in your group who hasn't been here before. Then plan on an extra 15 minutes for the SIX people on the sandwich assembly line read your bag and make a sandwich.which will be wrong. n nI wrote my order down on the paper bag. The 7 people working there today all read the same bag and still got the sandwich wrong. When I came back to get the bacon they forgot, they took it behind the counter and piled bacon bits on it. I asked if they were out of bacon, but that is their bacon. .old, crusty, processed bacon bits. n nTheir sandwiches are nothing special, they are over priced, and they apparently don't want to talk to their customers, so they make you fill in bubbles on a paper bag to place an order. n nI will avoid this shit hole at all costs.",1
"3 words Miso Marinated Cod! n nOK so we decided to go to Las Vegas on my friends birthday during his quater life crisis there is such a thing . This was the first restaurant we chose to dine at. n nFirst off it's at the Hard Rock Hotel. I don't like this place one bit. It's over rated and think Nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus Nirvana. n nOK we go in and get drinks first at the bar. Salty Dogs are great and they make it damn good at Nobu. n nWe get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy. Our server comes and asks us what we would like to order. We pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did. n nFirst course Spicy Tuna and I think Dragon Roll it was good, but come on I can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting! n nSecond course Tempura Rock Shrimp with Spicy Aioli and Tempura Vegetables with Soy Glaze. Very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex. n nThird Course Yellowtail with Jalepeno and Citrus Ponzu AMAZING! So damn good I would have eaten just that and be satisfied. Pepper Seared Rare Ahi with Chili Vinegar Sauce Again give me a plate of this and I would die a happy man. n nFourth Course Miso Marinated Cod This is by far the best seafood dish I have ever tried. The fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful! Simply heaven. n nFifth Course Trio of Sorbets n nI must say the food was great minus the first course! Spicy Tuna and Dragon Roll at a high end Japanese Restaurant? I don't know for a tab of 400.00 for 4 people I think that Spicy Tuna is not needed!",2
"If you're on a budget this is not your place.Very sexy bar, the concept, the decorations the multiple levels and the drinks. hit the ATM first !",2
"Expensive and small drinks drafts seem to be 12 oz, and wine is sparsely dispensed in interesting glasses with a little bit of red liquid at the bottom . Nice outdoor seating area and a hipster interior. We had dinner there once, but made the mistake to order salads instead of their better looking pizzas. The salads consisted of oily dressing drenched wilted salad leaves a sad experience much in contrast to the trendy locale. Bottom line little value, great looks, eat pizza if you must frequent this place.",1
"One of the best restaurants in Madison. The buffet is amazing and the service is consistently top notch. n nThey have some standard dishes on the buffet but also rotate through specials especially on weekends . I've never had something bad. It is refreshed often and, as someone else has already mentioned, hot food is always hot and cold food is always cold. My favorite dishes aloo gobi, aloo chole, and mutter paneer. I love that they have a full range of items from nice crispy appetizers through to a great dessert selection. I think the gulab jamun is probably my favorite but the semolina cake is also fabulous. And the mango ice cream. . I highly recommend going for lunch and skipping breakfast and dinner D n nI'm afraid I've never ordered off the menu or been there for dinner so I can't comment on that. The price of the buffet is fantastic, especially given that you get to try so many tasty dishes, so I've never been tempted to try the menu.",2
"I had the prime rib dinner and it was good. I also had the coupon which makes it even better. I'd come back again however I gotta try other places since I don't live here. The main waiter could be alittle nicer though, n nNOTE This review is based on a visit in Dec. 2009",2
"I just tried Tumbleweeds for lunch recently after reading the great reviews on Yelp. I travel to Wickenburg for business quite often and am always looking for healthy vegetarian friendly fare. Tumbleweeds offers quite a few vegetarian options. They have lunch specials starting at 5.99, which is very affordable. I tried the soup, salad, and dessert ""shot "" special. The tomato soup was excellent, and I really enjoyed my peach cobbler dessert shot served in a shot glass . The owner, greeter, and server were all very friendly and welcoming. I will definitely return to Tumbleweeds next time I'm in Wickenburg.",2
"This is my first review on yelp. My wife and I were looking for a place we could take the kids for ice cream tonight after visiting bass pro shops. Did a search on yelp found this place. nI've got to say I've never tried gelato before but my wife thought it looked good. I got peanut butter and banana, the wife got PB and choc Oreo, and my kids got Oreo and choc chip. As my 5 yr old said, this place is off the hook. We will definitely come back.",2
"The best mediocrity money can buy that's the only way I can describe Showstoppers. This is definitely an ego piece for Steve Wynn, producing a show for his own exclusive pleasure without any regard for Vegas demographics or the taste of Vegas show goer's. I am not a Broadway neophyte, yet I found the choice of material puzzling, if not obscure. The talent is at a high technical level, but the cast lacks charisma, and the show lacks charm and humor. The show would have been considered old and dated 25 years ago, and consists very much the sort of material I have seen in high school Broadway reviews. Showstoppers would be very much at home on a cruise ship, but it is an anachronism on a Vegas stage. Given what Le Reve has to offer next door, the ticket prices close to Le Reve's are scandalous. The show will appeal to the 60 plus crowd, which is exactly the Vegas visitor demographic that has been dwindling in numbers over the past few years, so it will have difficulty finding an audience I couldn't imagine recommending it to anyone, other than a Broadway buff in their 70's and I only know one person who fits that description . Steve Wynn has proven that he knows a lot of things, but with Showstoppers, he has proven that he is completely out of touch with contemporary entertainment tastes. Given the demographic to which it will appeal, the show stands a chance of success if they cut the ticket price in half with a further 50 discount if you show your AARP card , have a showtime of 5 pm and throw in the buffet for free.

It helped it was not lunch rush yet . nWe started with spider roll which was yummy and big. nI always end up getting a bento box and a sashimi sampler. The presentation was superb and beautiful for the sampler. however the fish looked kinda dry.tasted fresh but looked dry. nWho could go wrong with the bento box. I just wish the salad had the miso peanut dressing rather than that gingery salad dressing. nOur waiter ""Won "" was very attentive and always had a smile on his face. n nThis makes a nice place for a date or out of towners for that ambiance setting. n nI would go here again.but maybe not as a first choice.",2
"Usually Sonic is an awesome spot to stop at, but this one must definitely be avoided! The drive thru was an extremely long wait. When we finally got to the window, our order was messed up. I got a chocolate brownie shake and specifically asked for no caramel. He looked at it and went ""oh, I thought you meant all caramel no brownie. "" Then our food came out and he said that all we had to wait for was my shake. After I received my shake, we went to park to eat at the tables. Once my boyfriend took our his bacon cheeseburger, they forgot to put in the BACON! Kind of ironic to order a bacon burger with no bacon, LOL! They also forgot to give me extra marinara sauce when I specifically asked for it for my mozzarella sticks. We had to push the button again and order them. A couple mistakes can go a loooong way, sonic.",1
"Since the other two locations near my home closed charleston eastern di pecos , this is the closest store now. n nWhile on a quick Best Buy stop on a saturday night a few weekends ago , my MIL and I went in for a quick peek before returning to her home. We only made it to the first few aisles produce, meat, cheese, markdowns but I was able to get a bunch of what I needed tangerines, romaine lettuce, 2 kinds of mushrooms, zucchini, fresh easy brand mozzarella cheese, and 2 packages of fresh easy brand sausage, for 16.00. I was happy. Overall, the store is clean, what we saw, anyway. There were many people shopping that night. My MIL said she should stop by here and shop more often. n nSelf checkout was speedy I know the drill . Carts were outside, in front. The parking lot is pretty ample. Should stop here whenever we go to dinner at my MIL's house, since it's in the area.

"I love this barbeque. I'm from Maryland and I'm used to a very smokey deep flavored barbeque far from the ketchupy mess most people call BBQ. n nTo start, it's clear that the owner Bill who also owns Copper Star Coffee really cares about this joint, the people he serves and the quality of the food. The ambiance needs a little work but if you are down for deep rich flavors, this is your place. The half chicken has a sweet, roasted spice rub with a hint of cinnamon with crispy skin and smoky tender juicy meat. And it's a huge portion. n nThe brisket and the pork are tender and delicious. Believe me I've had BBQ where the meat is dryer than August in Phoenix with sauce that barely wets the surface this stuff is juicy and moist. n nLike all BBQ some will love it and some will not. Judge it solely on the quality of preparation and have an open mind and you'll be a fan for sure. The worst part about this experience is when its' over. I can't wait to eat it again.",2
"Ok. n nEvery time that I drive past this food cart I want to just stop the car and run and get some food! n nI tried it for the first time about a month ago and have been addicted ever since. They always have chicken on the BBQ and it smells AMAZING! yum! My current fave is the canre asada tacos. They are only 1 and are truly amazing. n nThe only reason why they are getting 4 stars is simply because the last time that I went the salsa was really hot and almost empty. It was kinda gross. But, since I was going home and I had some there.it didn't hurt my meal. n nBesides that. YUM STATUS! If you want some great Mexican food on the go, STOP HERE!",2

"The owner of this location is a real jerk. I stood in line for 15 minutes and then when I finally got service at the counter the old man finally told me that his credit card machines were down.

"" Ummmm, nooo, it's 2012 I figured Schlotzsky's was modern enough to accept credit debit. I have no problem with technical difficulties and machines being down, but you should let your customers know instead of having them waste their lunch hour in line and then snapping at them for not carrying cash. n nI also asked him how I could go about getting a large drink with my combo meal and his response was "" Pay for it.

My experience with this business was great. They fit me right in and repaired my device with great knowledge and skill. I absolutely recommend this business. You can be confident in the quality of the work. I traveled across town to come here on a friends recommendation and decided to wait. I received a call that the repair would take longer than expected with great apologies and a waive of the labor fees for my inconvenience. Top notch customer service.,2
The rooms are great if you get what you want. You make a reservation for like a non smoking king room and they can't at all guarantee that you will get a king size room but instead 2 queens bed or a king bed. This is not at all the right way to do business. My wife and I got married 18 years ago at the Excalibur as we were going to stay there again but if they can't guarantee your room preference after making a reservation I would go elsewhere.,1

"This was my third stay in this hotel. The first since it became Elara. It looks like the check in process has gotten much better. I never had any problems before, but often noticed on my way back to the room that at certain times, there would always be a huge line at the front desk which has been remodeled since my last stay . n nThe rooms are nice, spacious, and loaded with amenities, but poor workmanship and low quality cabinets, fixtures, and other assorted building materials have aged at least some the rooms prematurely. More than just normal wear and tear. There were at least a couple things falling apart in each of the rooms that I have stayed in. n nAs others have mentioned, the housekeeping is a joke. On one visit, there was a small piece of paper on the floor for my entire four night stay that had obviously never had a vacuum run over it. Most of the silverware and drinking glasses were missing and the two empty glasses in the sink never got washed. This was consistent with all three of my stays. The beds were made and the towels were replaced though, so I know someone had been there each day. On this last trip, we called to get an extra blanket and pillow, but that request went unanswered. n nIt would be nice if they offered some one bedroom suites with two queen beds instead of the one king, but overall, the king suite is in my opinion the best bang for your buck on the strip when you consider things like location and convenience. Being centered on the strip considerably reduces cab fare, there are great restaurants for any budget and a lot to do and see in and around Planet Hollywood. You can also save a small fortune if you actually use the kitchen. The two ABC stores in the miracle mile are nice for some small groceries and you can buy booze much cheaper than at the gift shop. A bottle of Grey Goose was 47 at ABC, or 75 in the gift shop. Liquor stores are harder to find than you might think in LV. There IS one on Harmon and Koval which isn't too far from this place, but it's still a hike, or about a 15 round trip cab fare and they're no cheaper than the ABC store anyway.",2
"We were staying at TI, so we thought we might get a drink and see this short show with priority standing room . nMaybe it was just my sense of humor, but I thought it was so bad that it was funny. Especially because the dialogue was written to be ""titillating "" and that's what you'll get. Tits. Please don't bring your family to this. Yeah, the moving ships and cannons were fun, but you don't want to expose your kids to this. Maybe you should just stop and look at it quickly from the sidewalk and move on. nIt is worth saying that they have a man playing a parrot, in a ridiculous parrot man costume. What's even more ridiculous the sirens are grinding on him. nI really wish that they would stop playing that ""we're the sirens of TI screeching harpy music "" every time you leave TI.",1
i always eat at pizza hut but this was not a good location me and my friends got pizza chicken and cheese stiicks and one of them got really sick and whats makes this even worse we came back to complain and we saw a roach that was it for me i would never come to this location ever again i have no idea how they got a safety award for 2013 must have been a mistake stay away from this pizza hut location.,1
"Ok i may be biased because i already know of Lucilles and have enjoyed their Ribs long ago in California. Use to love to go for lunch and get the rib tips. BUT that was over 7 yrs ago. Since moving to Vegas Famous Daves are more around than Lucilles and driving to Henderson for happy hour isnt that appealing. SO such much excitement when i found out they were finally putting one at the Red Rock Casino location. SCORE you cant get no better than that. nSo this was my 2nd time to this location and i will say since its new there are some kinks that need and will be worked out. Love the Happy Hour specials just need to make sure the staff knows exactly what really on special and whats not. dont like surprises on the bill, but manager fixed it so no problem. The biscuit was so hard i really scratched my friend as i rubbed it on her hand jokingly. They quickly gave me some soft fresh biscuits as we laughed about it. nAs we sat at the bar area across from the smoker, i thought i was done ordering until they opened the smoker and all that deliciousness smell came drifting out along with slabs of mouth watering ribs. Um waitress please add some rib tibs to my order please. OMG that the best thing ever. How could u pass it up after smelling it and seeing it pass by lol i couldnt. Yep its only been a few weeks. I got faith they will step it up and be even better. The atmosphere is great nice and comfortable. Will be going back and taking lots of friends.",2
"I recently moved from California and thought I would start the journey in trying to find a decent and affordable nail salon. After reading the reviews at Red Rock Nails, I was impressed and thought I would give it a shot. My first experience was really good. I received a fill and the young lady was cordial and the quality of her work was exceptional. However, my second experience was TERRIBLE. The woman kept encouraging me to get a ""gel tip. "" I finally gave in and agreed. The very next morning, I woke up with cracks on 7 of my nails. I went in and they were kind enough to fix my nails. The gentleman who fixed my nails informed me to NEVER get a gel tip. I thought this was odd since the woman the day before was encouraging me to get a gel tip from the moment I sat down in the chair. Long story short, even with this gentleman's assistance.within two days, two of my nails chipped off. Unfortunately, the quality of their work is not so great for the price they are charging. I wouldn't recommend this place. If you do go, ask for TRISH. She was the young lady who worked on my nails the very first time and seems to be the only one that provides quality work.",1

"I'm not the biggest sushi fan, but I have to say that RA in old town is probably my favorite sushi place in the area. The happy hour is great. So many food items on it and you can't beat the sake bombs. Ra'cklin shrimp is my fav appetizer. I'm not too adventerous with my sushi but their shrimp tempura roll is my favorite out of all the sushi places I've been to. Like it Like it Like it.",2
I love this place! They don't have it on the menu any more but one of my favorite things you can still order is Mediterranean style calamari. The gator appetizer has the best sauce too. My favorite experience there was when they had a live jazz band playing. It's very noisy and crowded and usually you have to wait for a table but it's SO worth it if you like seafood.,2
"Camelback Mountain was arduous but once you finish you feel a huge sense of accomplishment. This was my first time ever going hiking and what an experience! I went on the Echo Canyon trail which is supposed to be harder. n nParking is very limited. There will be a lot of people there so you might get lucky but I didn't. There are about 35 40 parking spaces. You can park on an area on 56th that is a few minutes from the main entrance. From parking to the trail is about a mile walk. n nYou will sweat. Now is not the time to try to be prim and proper because by the time you make it back down you will look awful, but in a good way because others there will be able to empathize. You will have to crawl, scoot, and use what ever means necessary to climb especially if you're a novice. Believe me, some of the rocks there got very familiar with me! There is railing and fencing at the beginning but after that it's all nature! n nDress lightly, bring lots of water, proper shoes, and a positive attitude. Climbing up can be just as difficult as climbing down so it's great to stay optimistic. I used my boyfriend as motivation since he was leaping on the rocks like a billy goat! n nDon't rush. If you are in regular health and new to hiking it will take about an hour to make it up. Sure you will see Bodybuilder Bob but don't let that hasten your hike. The rocks can get slippery and if you rush thinking you have superhuman abilities, especially if it's your first time hiking you can seriously hurt yourself. And don't be fooled that it will be easier going down, go down with more precaution than you used going up. n nThe people there are great. They will encourage you and talk to you. So good luck and make sure you take lots of pictures once you make it up the top because this isn't something you want to miss out on for pictures!",2

"Having seen this place on TV, I always wanted to try this place. We walked in at lunchtime on a Friday afternoon and saw only 3 tables occupied which should have been the first sign. My son wanted a sandwich so we asked what I believe was the owner if she had any on the menu. She replied ""we only sell pho, best in the world. "" OK, so my wife and I order the combination pho, meat outside. One size bowl for 9, which in my eyes is highway robbery. She wanted to charge 2 per person extra for the meat outside! My son ended up eating chicken fried rice. n nFood comes and no meat outside and none of the standard meatballs inside. The fried rice was tasteless. As for the pho? Hardly the best in the world! The rice noodles were the wide thai variety noodles and not the standard thin noodles. The noodles were not cooked through. The broth was just ""OK. "" Very little vegetables to add to the pho. Even the water tasted funny. n nThe bill comes and we get charged for the meat outside even though they didn't bring it out to us. Very pricey for sub standard food. To claim she has the best pho in the world is very gutsy when it is not. She should take a vacation to Hawaii and eat at Hong Cafe in Chinatown to taste what real pho is all about. n nThere are even signs posted in the restaurant asking it's customers to let the LVRJ that it should be included in the ""best of "" rankings when obviously they didn't make the list. I wonder why? Save your money and eat elsewhere!",1
"Delizioso! That perfectly describes the pizza here. What is it about this pizza that makes it so darn delicious? The cheese? The crust? The toppings? The fact that I'm starving? Do they really ship the water for the pizza all the way from NYC? No, but after having the pizza here, I'd believe it. According to their website, they actually hired "".a chemist to analyze and recreate the mineral content and exact composition of the water. "" n nI had a large pepperoni pizza with sausage on half of it and mushroom on the other half. It was everything you expect New York pizza to be. So so good! I loved the thin crispy, slightly burnt crust and the quality ingredients. The the mini pepperonis were just perfect with the sausage. I don't normally eat the crust but it was that good. n nMy absolute favorite pizza place. If only I lived in Vegas. Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, there is rarely a wait. If you love good pizza, especially New York style pizza, you won't be disappointed.",2
Their car museum is a rip off. I can't believe they charge admission. They only have 4 motorcycles and 12 cars. No info is displayed.

It's also dark and deserted in there very depressing. Sure wish I could get my money back.,1

She kinda just coated me in wax and ripped. And for the face waxing I was seated in a chair, facing all the rest of the room, which is kinda awkward.

"So maybe we hit it on a bad night. but honestly, this was a terrible night of bad service and questionable food drinks. but we had made reservations, and they lost them. Then we put our name down in the book. And 40 minutes later 20 minutes after the 20 minute wait we were told about , we were told that they didn't have our name down on the wait list. So we waited another half hour to get a table. My sprite and my sister's coke tasted so jank, like soap and chemicals. So we went and got new ones while we were waiting. Thankfully it was ""free refills "" so we didn't have to pay to get un rancid tasting drinks. Mine was fine after that, but then my sister's redo coke also tasted of soap and chemicals again. So we finally got her a third one, and it tasted watered down, but it was the best one yet, so she decided to leave it. nSo finally, we get our table, and are starved and looking over the menu at what looks good. Our waiter comes out and tells us that a lot of the menu items are no longer available tonight mind you this was around 8 8 15 . He goes on to list all of the items that are not available, and eventually my dad stops him and says. so what IS available? More items on the menu weren't available than were.

I had their eggplant sandwich and one other girl at our table tried mine as well. We both got food poisoning. I was actively sick for about 36 hours. I called the restaurant just to let them know so they could check their ingredients, and the girl on the phone was very nice but told me she'd have to have the manager or chef call me back. She took my number. and I never heard a thing. I sure hope they didn't serve any more of those to anyone else!",1

"When God appointed Gluttony as a sin. He was eating at Hash House. Plan on not dieting when you eat here. The biscuits can feed an etheopian kid for a week.

It makes buffets look like 1 trip. nCocktails inventive.Bloody Mary with pickled green beans? NICE! nCoffee drinks.just order the coffee with the smore's goodness on there. nBudgetwise it's reasonable for the amount of food you get. Ok does Idaho have potato shortages from this place. nYea too many little fried spaghetti thingies and those damn leeks. SAVE THE FRIED LEEKS!",2
"One, it is a GameStop. The layout is pretty good for a GameStop. It isn't too big or too small. The reason I will mark them down, though, is the management at this store will flat out lie to make a sale. I understand that having an excessive number of Xbox Ones does not help the bottom line, but it is disingenuous to say that the games like Watch Dogs, Battlefield 4, etc perform equally on the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One. That is flat out lying to the customers. When Digital Foundry, Lens of Truth, Gamespot, etc point out the differences, this should notify the customer never to do business with this store again.",1
"Worst place to buy anything! Prices too high and they sold me Expired Creme that didn't work. The container didn't pump out the Creme. I took it back with receipt and they blamed me for the whole problem. The manager and sales girl were accusing me of stealing another container because I asked to exchange it for one that worked. What a joke! They were just angry because I was right! I will never go back there again. Whole Foods is awesome, less expensive and fair people to deal with! Done!",1
"Don't think I will ever return on a weekend afternoon. Always way to busy, which I guess is a good thing for business, but I waited 30 minutes for 2 ""to go "" sandwiches wanted to eat there, but never seems to be a table . Even the man who ordered after us got his food first somehow. It just seems that the service is a little confused lots of very young workers . Sandwiches were pretty good, the mango smoothy was good too, but it's tough to deal with the wait unorganized service.",1
"Love this Buffett, when I'm in Vegas this is one of the places I must hit. The crepes and food selections are amazing. If you get lucky and get a groupon u get two for one and a bottle of wine. Planning my next trip to Vegas and will sure go back.",2
Being from Cali. I love a great gourmet grocery . I cant express how my heart flutters at the smell of a great cheese department. not for the Cali in me but for the Parisian in me. ahhhh! Bon Fromagerie! I wont say this AJ's gets me going like the Aj's in other areas of PHX. but still thats just pure out being high maintenance and picky picky. Im happy to have this gem in the desert. I love the wine department. the cheeses. the gourmet of it all. oh yeah. and the desserts mmmmm a pure piece of heaven. if Im feeling decadent that day. and when running late for a party. you can always know that AJ's will have a quick run in and grab plant or beauty of bouquet . ,2
"while it's 104 degrees outside, it is a comfortable 25 degrees in my mouth. aaaaah n nRed Mango did just the trick for the heat of a Las Vegas summer. a giddy girlfriend and i ran to the sleek store front as the rest of our group ducked into the neighboring CVS pharmacy. where would YOU go for comfort huh? n nthe original yogurt itself is not too sweet and not too tart. in my opinion and that of baby bear , it was juuuuust riiiiight ! they offered the standard tastings of chocolate bars, fruit, and cereal my personal pick blueberry, pineapple, and fruity pebbles! , in the standard sizes, and served it up nice and cold. n na hearty serving of gourmet snow in my mouth, zapped with some fruity vitamins, and crunchy cereal made for a happy, heureuse di! along with the rest of the gang as they intruded with their spoons! n nbe sure to stop by!",2
"First of all, I'll start with the name. I originally thought that this was a children's clothing store. I don't like cutesy names for kid's clothing stores, so taking a name like that and applying it to a bar is enough to rile up the cranky old man inside of me. But I digress. n nI came here on a date her choice , and got there a few minutes before she did.so I ordered a whiskey and diet. The diet was flat. I found a table and sat down and was messing around on my phone while waiting. As I was viewing the 2011 Cardinals schedule on my phone, I saw something moving across the table out of the corner of my eye. It was a cockroach. n nAnyways, once she got to the bar, we had a couple other mild disappointments. The waitress seemed scatterbrained for the first half of the time we were there. She bought us drinks that we didn't order, and didn't bring us ones that we did. However, after a while, she improved.I'm guessing that she was ""in the weeds "" as servers call it, when we got there. Not a big deal, but obviously not impressive. n nThe girl I was with ordered what they call a ""vegetarian "" quesadilla. I would have just called it a quesadilla. There's not really any veggies in it. Also, they are the only place I have ever been to that mentions Hepatitis on the menu, but they spelled it wrong. Misspellings on menus also rile me up, what can I say? n nAll said, this is a below average bar in my opinion. I would go back, but only if a friend or someone wanted to go.not a recommendation in my book at all.",1
"Located inside Bellagio you will find this upscale LV! My fiance was nice enough to introduce me to this sweet yet expensive addiction. n nI was in the market for an every day purse. And LV was what I had set my eye heart on. My BF surprised me and took me to the LV and told me to pick my everyday purse. I was so excited that I didn't even know where to start. I knew I wanted an LV purse but didn't know what style. n nWe were greeted by a friendly sales associates, everyone seems pretty friendly in the store. I knew I wanted a bigger purse that I could use every day. I also didn't want anything that looked too ""fancy "" that would require me to dress up every day. With all of this in mind, the sales associate pulled out 5 6 purses. And yes, it was hard to make a decision. Just as expected I had a hard time making a decision, I tried on purse and then another and another. I would look at one purse, the next and the next. The Sales Associate was very patient. He even gave me suggestions on what looked good, ok, or not good. I appreciate and honest associate. n nFinally I settled for a purse. They had us sit in their lobby area while they wrapped it and made it all nice and pretty. Its a nice touch they offer you a beverage, yes, alcohol included. I mean its expected, you drop a few hundreds or thousands of dollars you better be getting some top notch service. n nIf you are staying in the hotel they will also deliver your goods to your room. n nThis store us pretty well stocked and everyone seems to be friendly.",2
"I come here more often than any other restaurant. The food is not just typical bar fare but often re imagined, clever, and always delicious. n nThere is not one thing on the menu, or any of their daily specials, that I haven't liked. Favorites include the appetizer Slingers, the Pork Belly Smokehouse Burger, and the SanTan Sonoran Dog, but you can't go wrong anywhere on this menu. n nAnd that includes all of their craft beer. The Devil's Ale is my favorite, and the Epicenter Amber was my first love here. The seasonals are always very good too.",2
"We've actually stayed at this hotel on 2 previous visits and had nice stays, however our most recent stay April 26th and 27th was just plain awful. We arrived early on Friday at about noon and Justin was working the front desk. We did not request to check in early, but we did request a top floor room as we did when we made our reservation. Foot traffic noise in this hotel is exceptionally bad. Every person's footstep sounds like a loud bass drum, so if you're a light sleeper, you need to be on the top floor or you're going to have a long, miserable night. So when we politely asked Jason about a room on the top floor, he said, ""Sure, I can get you one of those "" He wrote down our names on a scrap sheet of paper and told us he'd call us when the room was ready. By 3 30pm we had not received a call so we decided to head back to the hotel. When we tried to check in with Justin, he said, ""Okay, I've got you in a room on the 2nd floor. "" We asked why he put us there when we specifically requested the top floor 3.5 hours ago. He said, ""Sorry, I'll put you back on the list "". So we had to continue to wait. When we came back about 6pm, a different person was working the front desk. She said, ""Sorry we won't have any rooms on the top floor tonight. I don't know what Justin told you, but they're simply not available now "". So they basically gave those rooms to someone else. Here's where it gets really bad. This woman apologized for the situation and said, ""Here, I'm going to block off a top floor room for you tomorrow night so you'll be guaranteed a top floor room tomorrow. "" We said ""thank you "" and managed to sleep on and off despite the fact that she placed in a room that bordered the stairwell and we got to hear people running up and down the stairs all night, and we got to stand in 5 inches of water in the shower since it didn't drain. Now, the next day, we try to check in early and Justin says, ""Your room should be available in a few minutes "". So we waited there at the hotel for 90 minutes just to watch Justin walk out the door for the day and the new woman promptly tell us that there won't be any rooms available for another 2 hours. I verified with her that she still had that room blocked off for us and she said ""yes "". So we headed out and when we later returned that evening to our ""guaranteed "" top floor room, and the new guy at the front desk says, ""Sorry, I see that she blocked off a top floor room for you, but for some 'unknown' reason, I don't have one for you "". Someone at the front desk that afternoon evening basically unblocked it and gave it to someone else. So the front desk staff there basically lies to your face, kicks the ball down the road or points their finger at the previous shift, and steals rooms from each other, Also, despite leaving a tip for housekeeping on our first night's stay, they decided to keep my iPhone charger instead of turning it in to the front desk. So they're a pack of thieves who steal even when you are nice enough to leave a tip. Overall, a horrible stay at this Holiday Express which is unfortunate because we've had 2 nice stays in the past which led us to stay again on our recent trip. We will absolutely never be back.",1
"Yummy Yum! Wee hours of the morning stop LOVED it! They have a wide variety food selection. We each got different types of meals we were all pleased. I ordered the big turkey club with fries. It was delicious! Coffee was good the waiter service was good. The early bird special does not start until 6 am.just a FYI And served as 2 meals as I had the other half boxed up to eat the next day. We were there as bars were closing, so the clientele proved to be diverse, interesting a great place to people watch. A local band had just finished performing and walk in with their guitars in hand. Next time I am in the Burgh, I will be eating there again!",2
The food is fairly good. The servers and staff are generally rude and disinterested. The setting is nice but the crowds are large and the buffet is stressful.,1
"Tried this place after getting a groupon. I was very pleasantly surprised. The location is not the best, but what was lacking in appearance, certainly made up for it with the food that was served. n nThe decor inside of the restaurant is very well put together. Somewhat, a kind of modern mexican feel. n nI ordered the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast. A great choice that I will definitely order again. The meat was so tender and melted in your mouth. The spices were spot on. I paired it with the green chili cornbread casserole and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Both of which were amazing. n nMy fiance had the pernil asado. This was also very good, but was not my favorite of the two. Although, I don't really eat pork. n nOverall, I would definitely recommend. If you plan on going, get reservations, or you might end up having to sit at the bar. Its a small place. Sometimes so busy that they never answer their phone something they can probably improve on .",2
"We came with 2 friends and received awesome customer service! We ate here at 9pm on Sat. March 28th. We didn't know the Decatur location closed an hour earlier than the Tropicana location but they still stayed open for us even though we got there right at closing. Moe ? and his wife were very friendly and we would definitely recommend the food. We had garlic fries, chipotle burger,pastrami fries, patty melt yummy! I am going to make this one of our stops whenever I visit Vegas again.",2
"Yawn. In need of a facelift and some sprucing up. Cheap, for sure, but you get what you pay for. And for just a small percentage more you can get much more for your buck. If you've got kids, it's probably ok. But the amenities, food, drinks, rooms are all pretty boring if you're going to vegas for fun and glitz and glamour.",1
Why did I come here? I must be an idiot! Rip off and woefully inadequate. I was starving. Spoiled from living in San Francisco.,1
This Starbucks drive thru has spoiled me on others. The wait is always less and the team is always friendlier. The drinks are pretty awesome too.,2
"This was my first visit here. It was almost a 3 star review, but I am bumping it to 4 stars because they have a 5.95 menu with a few popular items that comes with their regular menu. I'm pretty sure that no other Mexican restaurant or any restaurant for that matter hands you a ""cheap menu "" along with their regular menu! n nFor a small family like mine, the 5.95 worked perfect. Order one entree off the regular menu, order one off the cheap menu, and you can walk out of there at dinner for less than 20. n nThey serve chips and salsa at every table the chips are served as whole tortillas and you have to break them up to dip. I have never seen that before and I can honestly say I have probably eaten at over 1,000 Mexican restaurants in my life. n nFor our first visit, we stuck to the basic enchiladas and tacos. nThe food was very average. We really liked the mexican rice it was better than at most places. n nOur service was average. The restaurant was pretty busy on a Wednesday night. We plan to return and try some other items. All in all, a good dining experience.",2
"I'd say what distinguished this taco shop from others that have a comparable menu are the little touches. n nThey have a little sauce bar with about 3 or 4 types of sauces my fav is the tomatillo sauce, so tasty! with little to go containers AND lots of lime slices. People just don't seem to get the importance a fresh squeezed lemon or lime on a taco, BUT THIS PLACE GETS IT YAY! n nThe flautas come with guacamole AND fresh Mexican cheese sprinkled on top, not mozzarella. n nPrices are very reasonable. I ordered 2 small carne asada tacos, 1 order of flautas 2 large horchatas rice drink it came out under 10. n nThe location is small, but it's nice, casual clean. They have a TV that was on a sports channel guessing by the big Cardinal plaque in the middle of the room, they are probably cardinal fans ",2
"Just had their New York Half Half, the sandwich comes full of pastrami roast beef on rye. n nGood sandwich overall with fries. n nHeard they have a good steak too. n nI will stop by here again when staying or visiting the Hard Rock Casino.",2
Best Buffet that my hubby and I have been to! It's definitely our top pick! OXTAIL SOUP is awesomeeeeeeee! Cant wait to go back to Vegas!,2
"So I came here for a conference and if this was my first time in Vegas I would prob never come back! The Monte Carlo is horrible compared to where I've previously stayed on Vegas. Where do I begin? Let's start with the room. n nRoom super old school, dirty carpets, nicks in walls, chipping paint etc. I've added photos to this review so you can see exactly what I'm talking about, but the worst of the worst was the bloody bandaid that I found on my shower wall on day 1 that remained until day 6 when I left despite me telling the housekeeper about it. Also didn't appreciate the holes in the sheets and the lack of hot water! Now I stayed on the 17th floor and when I say I like to take hot showers I mean steaming up the bathroom almost too hot to breathe showers lol. So I thought maybe I'm being unfair and the water does get hot just not as hot as I'm used to. WRONG! I polled several of the hundreds of women at my conference and they all said the same. The water feels hot when it's running in the tub but when u turn the shower on it's like warm at best. It's also hard and made my skin super dry, but I was told my a local that Nevada has some of the hardest water in the country. Funny I don't remember that from my previous stay but whatever. n nHousekeeping not worth their weight in salt! Housekeeping never changed the sheets, cleaned the tub or toilet. They only thing they did was provide new towels. I had to request soap. Also didn't appreciate leaving my room at 9 30 am, coming back at 3 00 pm and still having a dirty room. Especially when the same housekeepers were in the hall in the exact same location ""cleaning rooms "" when I left and returned. The last thing I didn't appreciate was the housekeeping staff placing my items in my luggage bags despite them being out of the way. It kind of makes me feel like they were going through my luggage and made me uncomfortable. I've never had that happen before. n nDining so I loves the cupcakery! Great tasty cupcakes and Starbucks was good with pretty fast service. I also appreciated the 24 hr fast food places in the hotel. This proved very useful with my early morning flight. The Cafe was where we ate several times. Good food horrible service! They seem to be understaffed no mater what time you patronize them I went during normal business hrs and late at night early morning and the service is very slow so if you're in a rush to catch a show you may want to skip this place. The good thing is they had 2 for 1 house wine for happy hour and it was good. The buffet was okay, not worth 20 bucks in my opinion, but hey it's Vegas! n nOverall this hotel could use a major renovation big time! The only reason I gave it two stars is bc the waitresses in the cafe are very hardworking and try their best to accommodate you and the food is decent. I wouldn't stay here again or recommend anyone else to.",1
This sure ain't pizza! It's a fast food chain's simulation. Don't waste your time or appetite on lukewarm assembly line pie.,1
"I've never eaten in the restaurant, but I have always ordered from home and then gone to pick up my pizza pie. As many have stated before they have issues with ordering over phone, whereas I have never had any problems. So that's a plus? n nI'm going to Chicago soon, and if this is the kind of pizza to expect I might as well find something else to eat! I like the style of thin crust pizza, but its always soggy when I bite in expecting a crunch. The pizza sauce they use here just doesn't do it for me. Instead of the rich heartiness one can squeeze out of a tomato, I feel like I am on a bridge between entree and dessert! Keep on mind I am a sweets junkie, so I rarely complain of my food being too sweet. I also feel like the sauce over powers everything, I feel the texture of pepperoni, but where's the taste? n nFor now, I'll stick to New York style pizza n nHopefully, the infamous Chicagoan pizza cheers me up and shows my taste buds what I've been missing.",1
"This restaurant is a real treat. Fellas, if you want to impress your girl, take her here! It is away from the strip and situated inside Green Valley Ranch. It is beautifully furnished and decorated with crystal chandeliers in each room. This is top of the line luxury here. It is a bit pricey since sides are sold a la carte and two steak entrees can easily reach around 150. But if you want a fine steak and maybe want to celebrate a monumental moment in your life this is definitely the place to go.",2
"Man.I cannot win for losing with this place! nAfter my disappointment 9 days ago, I decided to give it another try. nWhen I walked in there were 4 occupied tables and no clearly visible direction of where to go to order take out. But at the back of the restaurant there were two red tablecloth covered tables and pretty filthy tableclothes, I might add and there were 2 men standing to the right of one with a very harried looking asian lady running back and forth between asking diners if they needed to go boxes, delivering food, taking orders, and making change. I asked the man in front of me what was going on? He grabbed a few xeroxed menu copies from one of the tables and handed them to me, explaining that he'd been standing there for awhile and hadn't yet ordered himself. nWow. nWhen the waitress could this possibly be the infamous Rose? slowed down long enough we found out there would be an hour wait on all take out orders! nI didn't want to wait an hour, that's for sure. nShe told me to take my menus and call ahead next time.then breathlessly muttered, ""Happy New Year. "" nSo.I will try again. nThis place had better be worth the wait or I'm just gonna go across the street to Chen Wok next time!",1
I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken bowl and the rice was under cooked and had no taste at all as well as the chicken. Eating healthy doesn't mean it has to be tasteless. I won't be returning.,1
Lasted a month and even with the menu redo it's officially closed. again. This location has so much potential if they could find the right management and remember that its not the strip so resort prices need not apply.,1
"I don't seem to have good luck at zipps had a bad experience at another location decided to try this close to home, I ordered a salad the lettuce was old brown and wilted, when server asked how it was I was honest she was like clueless, never sent a manager over to say sorry. When she brought the card back she left no pen to sign",1
"We called Matt after finding him on line, and asked him to address a few random items from a home inspection. He was very communicative, was on time and stood behind his work. This is not your grandfathers electrician. This is a company that prides themselves on high quality customer service.",2
If I may give this bakery a rating it will be the lowest of the lowest. This bakery do not deserve to have customers for the bad service that we received here. My partner and I went in here to buy some pastries and I noticed they were also selling non fat yogurt smoothie and asked the low life cashier that is supposed to be the owners daughter what kind of flavors they have. She did not answer me and instead turned the sign of the non fat yogurt backwards so no one can see it. She was ringing up the items we bought and was banging the keys of the register. We asked her if there was a problem and she was not responding. We thought she did not know how to speak English. Boy were we wrong. We asked her again then she replied I'm not being rude you are the one that is being rude. We then said we don't want to buy this anymore.she said that's good we don't want your business and then threw us 11 in paper bills. Then said never mind.give me your card and I will credit to you. She was making faces and I said stop making faces then she said to me what your face isn't that nice too. She was mumbling.saying stupid gay.that is when I blew up. I called her a f.ng bitch she called me f.ng bitch as well. I called her a.hole.she called me the same thing.My partner asked her name and she told her to get out of the store if she doesn't leave she will call the cops. We have never been insulted by a business as a paying customer anywhere in our entire life. They should just close their business if they are just going to insult and get personal with their customers. Boycott this place.they don't deserve our hard earned money.,1
I've experienced the same as most everyone else. Cold and sometimes soggy food. I've been here multiple times and over a few months. It seems to be getting worse as time goes on.,1
"The staff seem friendly enough but I think there are some weird policies going on with new game releases. I went in looking for a copy of Halo 4. The employee behind the counter said that there were no copies available because everything was preordered already and it would have to be mail ordered. He added that Wal Mart and Best Buy were all sold and the best chance to get them game would be to order it with gamestop and wait a week for it to be shipped. A quarter mile stroll to the Wal Mart in the same shopping center revealed that not only was Wal Mart not sold out, but they had plenty of copies available. I'm really disappointed that the employees would lie so readily just to get a sale of a game that, based on the hundreds of ""preordered "" copies sitting behind the counter they had already done quite well selling. Dishonesty does not breed loyalty in customers. n nBoo.",1
"Waited long for service, but its okay I understand since it was busy, but no apology?! That, im very disappointed. Especially the fact that the guy was behind, where I could clearly see him, by the kitchen talking to BOTH the manager and the hostess. During our meal? NOT A SINGLE SMILE! wouldnt come back here. nWord of advice go to johnny rockets. Same food, much better service nicer staff.",1
"If you're going to claim sandwich superiority, you'd better deliver. This place is a shade better than Quizno's, but not by much. The ordering process is tedious. The store layout isn't convenient. It's just not a great place. Better than Subway, worse than Jimmy John's or Milio's.",1
"Kelly's has been on my to visit list forever, but I finally received the opportunity to check it out on Wed. I was planning to go to Burgatory with a friend to claim my free birthday milkshake, but a previous commitment ran late to the point that we were unsure if we'd have sufficient time before closing. Since my friend had also suggested getting drinks, I suggested that we try Kelly's instead, so we headed over. n nWhen we walked in, nobody came to greet us, so we seated ourselves at one of the booths. Upon doing so, a hipster waiter, complete with large gauges, tats, and interesting hair handed us menus. He told us that the drink special of the night was a rusty nail, which consisted of Scotch and Drambuie orange liqueur for 4, so we both decided to try it. It was smooth, but quite strong, to the point that it burned a bit going down. The ice thinned it out as we drank, however, so by the time we finished it, it was substantially thinner. n nBecause we were hungry, we decided to get some snacks to go with our drinks. As a mac and cheese snob, I had to order the mac and cheese, since I'd heard of its claim to fame as one of the best in PGH. Consistent with my preferences, this mac and cheese is of the baked variety, and comes with a crust on top, but has a sharp cheddar sauce that is surprisingly creamy underneath. Although it didn't beat my current front runner for best mac and cheese in PGH Carmi , it's definitely in the top tier of mac and cheeses score 9.0 10 . Based on my recommendation, my friend ordered the sweet potato fries with cajun aioli. When they came out, the fries appeared more like chips, but thicker see photo . While the flavor was very good, esp. hot, the texture left something to be desired, since they lacked crispiness or crunch. n nOverall, I enjoyed the drinks and food at Kelly's. The ambience was interesting something of a cross between a bar and a diner and came off as hipster without trying too hard a la Wingharts or being pretentious. My only complaint was that the music was a bit loud not so much that I had to shout across the table, but enough to be slightly annoying. I don't have any complaints about the service, except that I was carded I'm not usually carded at bars anymore but then again, my friend is a couple years younger than me . I'd definitely be up for stopping back in, esp. to try the much talked about happy hour, and some of the other interesting, less common drinks served there.",2
" Worst Beef Noodle Soup n nThe instant beef noodle soup Nissin I believe is better. Seriously, go put that in the microwave and it'll be better. And trust me, I am a snob. I grew up in a town with alot of Taiwanese people. n nI'll give it 2 stars because the niu rou xiao bing don't know the english name but it' s like a flaky pastry with beef inside is good. n nThere's some decent stuff here and I guess since there's not a plethora of Taiwanese options, I can see why people are reviewing higher.",1
"NEVER STAY HERE! n nThis is the WORST hotel in Vegas. Where do I start with my horrible experience. They mis booked my stay during CES, then when I checked in they put me in the wrong tower telling me that my tower was closed for renovation. I was moved in to a tower that was on the other end of the property with no valet service and no access from the front of the hotel. I was woken up a 9am in the room I was moved into by 10 workmen drilling on the side of the building and looking into my window, so we had to be moved to another room mid stay. Finally, the only close access to the tower we were moved into is the back parking lot of the hotel, which is well known by the staff to have problems with break ins to cars, in fact the head valet had his car stolen out of this parking lot and the camera system does not even cover the cars in the lot, a point explained to me by the security staff. So of course. my car was broken into. When I complained and asked the hotel for action, they referred told me it was not their problem even though they refuse to provide valet service from that lot.",1
"The food was extremely disappointing. We ordered linguini with clams and I'm pretty sure they were canned clams. The service was ok. Young, inexperienced servers with a ton of enthusiasm who didn't know the difference between black pepper and chili pepper flakes.",1

"Great place. This is probably the 4th or 5th time I have eaten at a PF Changs and I have never been disappointed. We always start with lettuce wraps which are outstanding. This time there were 4 of us and we orderred MuShu Pork, Wok Beef, Zodiac Noodles, and Honey Shrimp to go with the lettuce wraps. All 4 of us thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes. We were seated right on time and were treated very well. This place is consistently very good. Probably should be 4 1 2 stars.",2
