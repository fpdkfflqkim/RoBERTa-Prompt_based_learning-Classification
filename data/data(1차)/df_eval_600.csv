"Everything looked great, but the execution lacked. I think it may come down to having too much water in the cheese. Despite the pizza's bottom being perfectly blackened, our pizzas were both sloppy messes that could not even be picked up without falling apart.",1
"We eat here for breakfast every time we are in Vegas. On our last trip 923 10 to 9 27 10 we decided we try another place closer to the strip and it only made us appreciate the Sourdough Cafe more! Our steaks are always cooked to order, the over easy eggs are NOT greasy and the coffee is good! n nWe usually just dine and dash but this time we were wonderfully surprised with a NO SMOKING room to play video poker! I was one happy girl with a cup of hot joe, video poker and smoke free air all in one casino!",2
"I am not sure what the hype was with this place. We ordered the oxtail and you could not eat the meat off the bone. It couldve been that they were closing. Will I give them another shot, maybe if there wasnt any other places to choose from.",1
read karen's review. n nI'm the guy who wanted to throw up.,1
"We walked in and thought the place looked poorly kept even though it had only been open a few weeks. n nGetting past the eww factor, we placed our order, half rack baby back and half rack beef ribs. n nI know this place isn't ment to be a substitute for a nice rib steak restaurant, but it is called the rib shack, a specialty shop that should do one thing and do it well. n nThe ribs were tuff, smuthered and drowned in barbecue sauce. n nMy wife took a few bites of both and said she wanted to go. I didn't want to throw away money so we packed up and left. I'm sure our dogs were happy. n nThe place is small, hot, dirty looking. n nThey are a true neighbourhood shop and I would like to wish them success, but I'll never recommend this place nor will we be back.",1
"Casey and Stephanie are awesome. Dalton was nice too. n nNow, Kevin is a different story. Kevin was a total freaking douche bag jerk off. Kevin is the reason, I will NOT return to this establish, my last weekend here in Arizona. n nI look forward to spending my money elsewhere tonight.",1
"This place is very spacious and nice looking place. Location is good and is attractive set up. They loose a star because the chair on the outside are so incredibly uncomfortable i left with my back hurting so sit on the inside or bar. The food was very tasty, one of the better spaghetti and meatballs iv had in a while. Also tasted there pizza. which was so super delicious! It is a must get. Prices are average cant complain. Would return.",2
"I ate at Fratelli's on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. It was very quiet, but the service and food were excellent. I ate the chicken piccata which was the perfect portion size and very tasty. My lunch date had the meatball sub which was also very good. The prices were excellent, I will definitely be returning to Fratelli's in the future!",2
"I've only ever been to Kampong Ah Lee once and it was delicious. I'd heard rumours of their laksa I love coconut milk in food very much , but never managed to get there until after going to a massive poetry event at Queen's Hall. I was starving, so that probably helped since we all know hunger is the best ingredient , but getting handed a massive bowl of laksa and I'm talking HUGE that I only paid 6 pounds for, was definitely a highlight of my year. That might be an overstatement. n nIt's a teensy restaurant, and it's quite popular, so sometimes you might find that you won't get a seat. We were lucky since there were only two of us. The service was really quick, and even though I managed to spill water and lassi everywhere over the table and myself , they didn't ridicule me or make me feel guilty, which is always a plus. n nI definitely recommend going. Give yourself some time to look through the whole menu it's overwhelming how much tasty stuff they have on it . And maybe go with a smaller group so that you're guaranteed a seat.",2
One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. Can't say enough good things about this place. The atmosphere is always spot on. It never gets crazy loud and they don't blare the music. Excellent beer and wine selection and Wednesdays are favorite with their 1 nights. Can't lose on that one. n nThe art is always wonderful and the seating is comfy and cozy. The small outside section during the Spring and Summer months is one of the best spots on the neighborhood. The owner Rodney is always around and one of the best dudes you'll meet.,2
"Stayed here a couple of years ago, for 1 night. I just have to comment.it was so disappointing. Another priceline bid deal gone wrong. n nHell.",1
"My wife and I loved this show. In our opinion, it was better than ""O "", actually it is probably our favorite show of the 12 we have seen. It's a circle theater at the Wynn and appears that there isn't really a bad seat. Some believe that the higher seats are actually better as with most of the Cirque shows . I don't like giving away too much to avoid spoiling but in a nutshell, a must see!",2
"Once in, we got seated at the non BBQ section and then they changed their minds and decided to seat us at the BBQ side, which we had to wait 10 min to get seated. Once seated on the BBQ side, our waitress then move us back to the Non BBQ side. Huh? n nWe got seated, and the waitress brought is 3 glasses of water and disappeared. I had to go to the front desk to ask for menus. Then she took our order and another 20 min later, we were waving our hands to get the waitress's attention, but they walked past us at least 5 times. We finally got our ban chan after the 20 minute mission of trying to get her attention. 10 minutes after that, our food came. n nI ordered the mushroom soondubu, which was basically all tofu. I counted exactly three mushrooms. I had to take half of the tofu out of the soup but it was still just tofu. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of tofu, but I thought I ordered tofu SOUP. Not just tofu. n nMy friend ordered kimchi jjigae, which was ok. You can't really go wrong with the simplest Korean dish. She also ordered chadol beef brisket , which was over cooked and chewy, so we sent it back. n nMy other friend ordered dwenjang jjigae, which was alright, but didn't really taste like dwenjang jjigae. n nNext we asked our server for some napkins, and he brings us one napkin. Lol is this some kind of joke?! n nI didn't expect to eat amazing Korean food in Vegas, but I didn't expect the food to be so foul. Horrible food. Horrible service. I vow to never step foot in Tofu Hut. More like unappetizing tofu cardboard box.",1
It was very disappointing to wait in line for one hour to buy a ticket for Body Worlds and then to find out at the ticket counter we'd need to wait over 2 more hours to get into the exhibit. Why no sign or greeter at the door to let us know that it would be 3 hours total wait? Big miss on their part and more than a few irritated people.,1
"Okay, so you hear ""Wolfgang Puck "" and figure it's a pretty safe bet. In this case, not so much. For starters, it's a Wolfgang Puck ""express "", which is basically another way of saying fast food. Upon walking in you sort of feel like you are in a cafeteria type setting, so we opted to eat outside. Our server was really nice and seemed to know a lot about the menu, which was good since the menu itself is sort of vague. The food comes out insanely quick, and not in the ""Oh wow great! I'm starving! "" kind of way, more like the ""Ummmm.how did that happen so fast? "" kind of way. n nMy favorite part of the meal was the bread that came with the butternut squash soup, which was very thick and tasty. I used it to dip in the soup and it was pretty good. I had the roasted chicken with a side of mashed potatoes, and it lacked flavor overall and seemed pretty thrown together. I came back to this restaurant a second time and figured I'd give it the benefit of the doubt, but left even more disappointed, and this time when I ordered the soup they didn't even have the bread that I was served the first time, which was really the only part I was looking forward to. Wolfgang fans, you can skip this express version and opt for the real thing elsewhere.",1
"Rockbar has become a regular spot on my rotation of favorite places to go. I'm in love with the way they remodeled it since acme.and to be honest the staff has become like family. They've got a great vibe at rockbar, and plenty of live music acts. It's a great place to unwind and get silly.",2
"I stay in hotels 3 5 nights a week. This hotel has some pros bed was comfortable with nice clean warm comforters. This hotel appears old and in much need of upgrading. Old dark brown doors that look like they have been hanging sine the 60s. It was below zero outside and the heat would be off every day when entering room. Really? A deep clean needs to be done in rooms. I had to move chair slightly to find a shoe and it was pretty dusty. I ordered room service 3 days for breakfast. First day, it was good. Second day, not as good. Third day, it was awful. Omelet was brown inside from being overlooked. Walls were very thin. I heard the guy next door on the phone at 5 30 AM. Not good! The shuttle was wonderful. It was below zero outside and it was nice to get shuttle to restaurants at night. Some front desk people were fabulous and some not so much. It was interesting.",1
"Real food, real conversation, really standard cuisine. n nThis review is long overdue, about a month and a half to be exact. This was my secret spot for peaceful meals and funny conversations after each night of the Life is Beautiful festival. I also parked my car here and would get it validated after each meal, which I'm assuming they will change this for next year. The last day of the festival, parking attendants were getting wise to the real use of their spaces, and trust me it wasn't for the nickel slots. n nThis place is not fancy, not pretty, but it gets the job done. From Thursday to Sunday I was parked at the cafe counter, usually around 1am, ordering everything your fitness trainer yells at you for eating chicken fried steak, chili cheese dogs, the lumberjack breakfast, chicken fingers, and for good measure some type of fried westernized version of an egg roll. The standard color scheme of each meal usually landing somewhere between gray and brown on the spectrum. Still, I savored each bite like it was my last. Yes, this food is terrible for you, but who wants to order a salad in the wee hours of the morning? n nThe service was good. I ordered food and it promptly came. This no frills style of eating can be enjoyable especially with the right company. I was usually solo when eating here so I would chat with my fellow snackers. Mostly old school gentlemen who would complained about how Vegas has lost it's ""class "". Apparently this dude has never witnessed the people dressed up as cardboard Transformers and bootleg Pixar characters on Las Vegas Blvd. In all seriousness the guy has a point. n nThe Binions Cafe is by no means something to rave about, but like a blue collar worker, it's reliable and gets the job done no matter the situation.",2
I recently moved to the area and needed a cut for my son. When we got there it looked broke down and crappy. The reviews mentioned keith so decided to go in and ask until lady came out and had a convo with me outdoors. She said he no longer works there and left a while ago. So I went back to my car and asked hubby what we should do. We decided to just leave bc I didn't want to take any chances on my sons delicate sensitive hair. Oh by the way it's not called reds anymore. Pineville something . It's called now.,1
"Co workers raved as well as family. I can say the service was top notch, Cesar was extremely professional and quick to meet my tables each and every need, if I had a restaurant I would have him as the trainer. The location is easy and central. Ideal for any occasion. nNow to the food part. I know you'll say "" who goes to Lawry's and gets pastrami "" but I did, it was recommended and it is my favorite sandwich. The pastrami is what docked the experience two stars. There was very little seasoning, a bit too much fat, and missed that good pastrami bite. I have had pastrami all over the country, I could say this didn't make it to the top twenty even. The homemade potato chips were good as well was the condiment bar. I can just say for a 14 sandwich and a 3.50 club soda, the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. I would tag this meal at a worth of right around 8.00 nMaybe someone will convince me to go back and try the primerib, I will then update.",1
A 3 star elsewhere but for LV a solid 4. n nWorthy comfort food and a change from the other 5 star dining over a weekend of debauchery over the 4th of July.,2
"I ordered delivery based on positive yelp reviews and was wildly disappointed. Worse than school cafeteria pizza. Flaccid crust. Nasty ketchup esque sauce. Just abysmal. I assume the wings are amazing, because the pizza is among the worst I've ever had.",1
"It lives up to the hype! Had a great meal, quick friendly service from a seemingly cheerful staff. Can't wait to go back! 9 n nI could definitely see where the anti bill splitting addendum could be a bother. but the cheap people can suck it up figure it out when they leave.",2
I have to say their food is awesome!,2
We had a lovely dinner. Was very pleased with the high level of service and perfectly seasoned and cooked dishes. This is a great find and does not focus in flipping tables and getting guests in and out. The only miss was lack if nice champagne or sparkling by the glass. We like to start out meal with a nice glass of bubbles before moving into our red wine for the main part of the dinner.,2
"Okay, I keep forgetting about this market on the west side. nI do go here when I do remember instead of Lee Lee Ranch L Market. nI always load up on basic Japanese cooking supplies and some fun stuff too. nThey used to have a little cafe in back I do miss it.",2
"Saw this place listed on Eat24 about a week ago and passed on it. Today I decided that it was worth a test and order the chicken strips w fries and the mozzarella sticks. The delivery was fast but the food fell way short. The chicken sticks where dried and burnt. I'd say they looked homemade but they clearly had been pulled out of a freezer and thrown in a fryer. Currently praying I don't get sick right now n nAs for the moszarella sticks, they just screamed store bought. Microwaved to Luke warm and soggy with a sauce that can barely be called sauce. What a sad first go and I definitely won't be back. Pass it along people, stay away. n n nP.s. If I get sick I'll update this later",1
Run don't walk away from the express breakfast buffet. Way overpriced for inedible food. I've had better free hotel continental breakfasts. This place is horrid.,1
"went here on a sunday to eat at ago. walked around the casino for a few minutes, which was very small. it's basically a big circle. n nwalked over to ago and had dinner. the service there was pretty good, but i wouldn't be going back. the food wasn't all that amazing. n nwhat gives the hard rock a 1 star review from me is the experience we had when trying to leave. we were trying to make it back to the palazzo for jersey boys. we figured we had left ourselves plenty of time to make it back about 45 mins . we get outside and the line for cabs was enormous. the guys outside are yelling 'no taxis tonight. take a towncar. 45! 55 for this lexus! 85 for this limo.' n nthey run a scam with the hard rock to make money. because we were in a rush and had already waited about 20 mins, we took the 45 town car. it was a 10 cab ride over. absolutely ridiculous. on the ride to the palazzo, we kept hearing over the radio 'hard rock to base. we need two suvs ect.' the guy who drove us told us they paid the hard rock 5 for every ride they picked up there. n nbecause of that, i will never go to the hard rock again.",1
"Oh ma word! Sooooo glad to have found this gem, their baked goods are so delicious! The chocolate chip cookie is amazing. The croissant with strawberry is freakin delicious too! If I'm Nevada again this place will be a must stop again.",2
"Best shaved ice I've had in a long time. I come from Hawaii born and raised and I'm used to the traditional shaved ice from Matsumoto's near the North Shore of Oahu . I would recommend ex strawbinary with mochi, boba and custard. n nBlack sesame is amazing too, but an acquired taste.",2
Great club over the years but new guy at the front is a dick and won't let anyone in. Even with VIP and bottle service we payed for.,1
"My family and I had a terrible dim sum experience at China Chan on a Thursday afternoon. They were out of practically everything we ordered and what we did end up with was sub par at best. The service was terrible and to tell you the truth, for what we got this place is overpriced. n nHere is a list of what we managed to sample steamed shrimp beef rice rolls, shrimp dumplings, bean curd rolls, chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, sweet white sponge cake, egg tarts, cocktail buns, and fried sesame balls. All of these items ranged from barely edible to barely acceptable. n nPerhaps China Chan does better on the weekends when there is more dim sum traffic and the food is fresher, but I wouldn't choose to come back here. Out of the 3 dim sum restaurants I have tried in PHX, this one ranks dead last for every reason.",1
"Pros n nGood location, not in a congested part of Old Town nGood service nHad the Chilean Salmon which was unbelievable nTable side Guac which is awesome nTasty Margaritas n nCons n nA bit pricey nGets a little claustrophobic inside nVery noisy on a Saturday night n nWill definitely go back and try the tacos and get some more ritas.",2
"I don't know what chilis has done with their menu but it is barely one step above mcdonalds. Horrible service, forever to get drinks, waitress ignored us and food is terrible. Will never go to chilis again. Worst ribs I have ever had. I don't know what sickly pig they cut them from but they probably shouldn't have been consumed by humans.",1
Awesome place! Billy did my pink and white for 33 he didnt even cut me! This was the best nail job i have ever gotten,2
"The word needs to get out about this place. for real. Better food than most of the expensive, trendy Scottsdale nosh stops and the prices seriously can't be beat. While it's hidden, the location is actually really convenient. It's right off Hayden and Roosevelt, which makes it an easy stop. Tons of parking and the strip mall is never crowded. n nI've had the iced coffee, a simple english muffin with raspberry jam which all tasted made from scratch, bee tee dubs and a yogurt parfait. I've also tried the english muffin breakfast sandwich, which was to die for! The pesto aioli that everyone has mentioned is certainly worth the buzz. Everything I've had has been awesome. n nI'm REALLY looking forward to trying the sandwiches for lunch. they oven roast their own turkey and chicken. I know I'm going to be eating there a LOT.",2
"Every time I go to Vegas, I do my best to get out of the airport as quickly as possible. And for good reason other than my overwhelming desire to go gamble away my life savings . There is NOTHING to do in this airport other than play slot machines and catch flights. There are no good restaurants nowhere to comfortably sit and enjoy and adult beverage no good shops. One time I got trapped in McCarran for over 5 hours during a monsoon storm. I wanted to gouge my eyes out I was so bored. I get it the powers that be want you to go to the Strip and spend your money as fast as possible. But God help you if you get stuck there like I did.",1
The food is authentic but I have had better Ethiopian food. Not sure what the other options in Vegas are but try awash in Los Angeles. That is in a league of it's own and after eating there this place first not stack up. I would not come back here.,1
"Loved it! I went on Sunday evening with my boyfriend and we got the livingsocial deal for pizza sangria which were both fantastic. We also ordered a salad which was delish but if you don't like a lot of salad dressing be sure to order the dressing on the side, it was quite a lot. We were so busy enjoying our food that a little dust storm blew through and we hardly noticed even though we were sitting outside. My only complaint would be that service was a little slow but it's a quaint, quiet atmosphere that is not packed with hostesses and servers jostling everywhere so, in my opinion, the quiet evening with fantastic food was completely worth waiting a little longer for service This is a great place for a date night or a girls night, check it out!",2
Food was average at best for a restaurant of this acclaim. Wine tower is impressive. Service subpar.,1
"This along with XS are my favorite clubs in Las Vegas. I would give this place five stars if it wasn't for the funky layout. Right when you enter you have to walk up this flight of stairs that will make you tired if you aren't moderately fit. n nThe cool thing is that there are several floors that play different music, and a pool room that is more of a lounge area to chill. More rooms means easier to find people as long as your have reception. When this place gets crowded though, get ready to fight through people since most of the floor space is not open grounds where you can just squeeze through people. n nGuys.be smart and buy your pre sale. I know, I know.you're a cool guy with LOTS of girlfriends and you get in free to clubs ALL THE TIME.stop being an idiot and just buy a pre sale. Now you don't have to be at the whim of the females and you can pretty much just walk into the club since the pre sale line is pretty short. Also, the tickets are cheaper.",2
"I was visiting Vegas from Chicago. I went here solely on the yelp ratings. It was well worth it. Good food. Good price. Clean. Lots of guys on their lunch were there, which tells me its good eatin.",2
"Genet was fabulous. She was very affordable, very professional, makes her clients feel comfortable. She paid a lot of attention to cleanliness, hygiene, and to detail. Great job Genet, will be back for ""maintenance "".",2
"Ate here on a recent trip and was pleasantly surprised. Though they have a cicerone he was not in when we were there. n nHad the brussel sprouts, bone marrow, and poutine for apps and they were all good. I love poutine and it was nice to see it on a menu but I'd suggest using something other than curds for the poutine, but it was enjoyable and all of it was incredibly rich and tasty and probably most importantly unique to the average Vegas dining experience. n nMy entree was the Scallops in oxtail stew with some fine shoestring potato crisps. Again incredibly rich and full of flavor, but a tad on the small side for an entree. Co worker got the braised beef which was good as well. n nLooking forward to eating here again.",2
"Awful. Just awful. Absolutely awful and I like Jimmy Johns. Went to this location to order my usual sandwich the only way I've eaten a deli sub sandwich for the last 25 years of turkey and provolone absolutely dry nothing on it. Get home and I think everything plus some is on this thing. Called up to let them know and the manager asked what I did order versus what I got told him and he laughed then asked ""are you sure you ordered that? "" BUDDY IM SUPER PICKY AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IVE AT A SANDWICH FOR THE LAST 25 years?!?!? His response was ""we can't verify you placed your order correct, we can give you a discount next time you come in "". SERIOUSLY?!?! As if I am making the mistake of giving you 8 bucks again to give me something I did not order! THE WORST SERVICE EVER!",1
"I visited Xtreme Couture on a trip to Las Vegas but I brought my gear because I like to train when I'm traveling. I asked the cab driver to take me from my hotel on the strip to the gym but it took him a bit of effort to find the gym because it is in a remote area that is not easy to locate. There does not seem to be much around the gym, coming from the city, this was not familiar with me. I did not get to train at the gym because of conflict with the class schedule but I did take a fairly detailed tour of the facilities and observed the classes that were going on. n nThis place is a true MMA facility. It is one of the most complete gyms I've ever been to and is well planned and maintained. There is an army theme going on with green camouflage prints all over the gym from equipment to walls. You will get a feeling of space as there are high ceilings so you don't feel claustrophobic like some gyms. There is a full sized ring, octagon, grappling mat area with fence, viewing benches, apparel store, strength conditioning equipment, sauna, and showers! The youth boxing class I was observing was impressive with kids fully engaged with their coach. n nI will surely check out their schedule the next time I visit and try out some classes! This would be a great gym to train in for those in the area. You owe it to yourself to check out this great training facility.",2
"Not a good first impression. I went with a few friends to Therapy for the first time on Wednesday night. I heard about their great martinis for 6 and I was eager to get my hands on one. n nWe walked in and put our name on a waiting list but it seemed like we were the only ones that did so and it didn't seem too busy . We stood around for at least 20 minutes watching other people being seated. Maybe I was too involved in conversation with my company, but it just seemed not right. We were standing pretty close to the bar and grabbed a menu hoping to get a drink while we were waiting. However, we never saw a bartender anywhere close. I have to admit, though, the drink names are very fun and creative! n nOne perk was that you can park in the lower parking garage and they validate. n nJust based on the initial walk in experience, I wasn't impressed. Even though it wasn't packed, I think the front of the house could have communicated to us better about our wait or at least be more friendly.",1
"The service was great my husband definitely enjoyed the hostess cute outfits. I loved the cool atmosphere the comfortable seats. I had a beer that cost 9.00 which was a bit much, but the food prices are what you should expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. n nTip make sure to make reservations if you have a rewards card you can get a discount. n nMenu tip they have a bar menu a dinner menu. So make sure to ask for both. If you sit at the bar you can only order from the bar menu. n nFood recommendation I highly recommend the Mac cheese. It's like no other you have ever had. It is topped with truffles. It is a good portion so you can share with another person or take the other half home. nIf your not a fan of steak fries then I don't recommend the pub chips since they are twice the thickness of steak fries, my husband is very picky and did not like them, but I thought they were yummy.",2
This place is a meat market. n nNot a judgement. Just callin' it like I see it.,2
