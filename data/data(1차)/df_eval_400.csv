"I wasn't sure what to expect with Taste it Tours. I went with a group celebrating my mothers 70th Birthday. What I found was not only was the food excellent at all of the places we stopped at, I discovered 4 new great restaurants which I plan on returning too and I was amazed on how much I learned about downtown Phoenix which I never knew and I have lived here for close to 30 years. I travel all around the world and appreciate other countries and never stop and appreciate my city like I was able to with Taste it Tours. Additionally, there was so much food, not only did I not have to eat lunch before hand, I did not end up eating dinner after wards Our guide was very personable, friendly, and just a great guy.",2
"Really unsure as to why this Hotel is getting so many good reviews. For a truly four or five star hotel, this place is not up to par. n nWe came for a 'romantic weekend' like many people from New York and were thoroughly underwhelmed. We paid extra for a room upgrade and our room faced out onto a giant construction site. The design was pretty 90's all shiny wood and washed out carpets. In addition, the bedroom didn't have a real window instead it had a window into the living area, which had the actual window. n nThe service was again, just ok. We checked in late and the staff misinformed us that breakfast was included. 70 and two bowls of berries later, we were told that we 'had misheard'. The recommendations the hotel gave us for food and things to do we thankfully largely ignored, although we made the mistake of following their advice for 'the best French restaurant in Montreal' for lunch, which took us to a tourist trap the likes of which Times Square would be ashamed of. n nIn any case, they have an ok hot tub on the roof and the location, though rather sterile, is convenient if you have a lot to do downtown. 4 5 stars implies hotels like the Nomad in New York, the Bel Air, 15 Beacon in Boston, the Hotel de Rome in Berlin. Hotel Le Crystal is not in the same league. n nTL DR n nThis place is like a Hilton Garden Inn with chandeliers. If you're on a business trip, it's a fine place to stay. If you're looking for something special and less than corporate, stay away.",1
"To make it simple, we were not too pleased that we had to wait 45 minutes for our RESERVATION.",1
"I've never been a big fan of Chili's, the saltiest restaurant in the country. This past experience was especially terrible. We were there as a family with 5 people and the service was very sub par. Our food did not come out together and the order was incorrect. Although the servers were friendly, the food was among the worst I have had at a Chili's. Everything was over seasoned and over cooked. At the Waterworks Mall there are several other food choices. I would recommend any of them over this Chili's.",1
"CHECK YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE YOU LEAVE AND DON'T PAY USING YOUR CREDIT DEBIT CARD! i have gone here a dozen times and it never fails, one of our cards will always get over charged. They will add to your tab so don't ever leave your card on an open tab. Pay for drinks as they come. The food is good but very very overpriced. The hookah is also very expensive as are the drinks. At night they try to turn into a club and have bottle service and a DJ so forget having a nice quiet dinner. After the last experience of being overcharged last month i vowed never to go back.",1
"I was pretty stoked when Amelie's opened up a mini version of its mothership in Uptown. Because, really, having salted caramel brownies within one mile of my house must up my real estate value. Or at least I think it does! n nAs the other reviewers have mentioned this is a mini version of Amelie's it's not quite as charming or lovely, but the employees are friendly and the treats are one in the same delicious. The selection at this location is limited, but still pretty great. You'll find eggy breakfast items, cream cheese puffs, delicious coffee, tasty sandwiches and the illusive salted caramel brownie. Expect pricing to run the same as the mothership it's not cheap, but it's worth the teeny splurge. n nIf you're a total sugar head like me and or you work Uptown, I bet you could figure their delivery schedule after a few days of treat stalking. Delicious! Thanks for feeding my frenzy, Amelie's.",2
"When in search of a gym, do the qualities you look for include insanely crowded, questionably clean spaces with employees who visibly hate their jobs? Great! You're in luck. n nTwo stars might even be a little generous for this location. I dislike going here so much that it's affected my motivation to actually work out on a regular basis which is why I bought a gym membership in the first place. Granted, that was back when the Pure Fitness on Alma School was still open, and I could actually stand that gym. n nIt's cheap, if that's all you care about. It's also bright and pretty big but not big enough to handle how many people are packed in here at ANY given time. Before work? Check. Lunch time? Check. Hour before close? Yep. Easter Sunday? You bet. Good luck coming in at any time that isn't ungodly early in the morning and finding a machine you want without a wait. You're gonna have to do a lot of aimless wandering and less working out. n nAlso, whose amazing idea was it to put the group class room in the middle of the gym which EVERYONE must walk by a million times with glass walls so that all the creepers and meatheads can stare at you during your yoga session? Extremely uncomfortable, and though they offer a good amount of classes, this feature alone keeps me from attending them. n nOnce you find a machine, you'll be lucky if it works. The cardio machines here suck, plain and simple. They're old, inconsistent, frequently broken, and simply terrible at measuring anything. Don't rely on them for that, ever. It's annoying as hell when I can't get an accurate heart rate reading for two seconds. I certainly don't have this problem with the machines at Priest and Elliot. n nSo, customer service? Do they actually train their employees to do anything but look miserable and try to sell? I don't remember the last time I was greeted here when I walked in. I don't usually see the same receptionist for very long, and they often don't acknowledge my entrance. In general, it's nice to say hello to the person who is helping pay your check, but whatever. I'd hate working here, too. n nAs another reviewer said, people here never wipe down their machines. SO. GROSS. I want to vomit every time I see it. Some huge dude drenched in sweat will drip all over his treadmill and then WALK AWAY. Never will I touch a machine here without wiping it down BEFORE I use it, as well as after. This just goes to show the kind of people that come here, too. No one cares. At all. And no, that girl twirling her hair and texting while she sits on the hip abductor is not going anywhere. Shoot me now. n nI could go on about this place for days, but I'll let you read the rest of the reviews for everything else that's wrong here. If you want a cheap gym and are able to get here at 5 AM, you'll be golden. If you're looking for a nice, convenient, friendly place to work out any other time of day, keep searching. This ain't it.",1
"It was oky,!",1
"I have always loved Red Robin. I went there and had the blue cheese burger not sure if that is the real name of it with a side of steamed carrots. Every time I go there is a different cook, so if you are like me and like a lot of blue cheese on yours I suggest you ask for extra! The carrots were actually nice and soft, I hate when restaurant say that they steam veggies and they are still hard. The service is always speedy and polite.",2
"Tonight we are having 2 of Uncle Sam's best the cheesesteak with mushrooms and extra cheese. The second sandwich is the All American Grinder lose the green peppers and add a large amount of of jalapenos. all of this to go so we come watch a recordeding of the Tuesday night NCIS Los Angeles. Just could not get any better. Hey we like eating at Uncle Sam just as much as the next person , bye you just can't beat take out from this restaurant , so fresh so hot so tasty.",2
"Even half off the value was just terrible and I left hungry. I have been here several times with a friend who works for the parent corporation and gets 1 2 off our bill. n nWith the discount I felt I could try a bit more and started my meal with an appetizer. I had the Ahi Poke, similar to a caviche small cubes of ahi came in a martini glass seasoned with some soy and garnished with a wasabi mayo. It was good but quite small. n nFor my meal I selected the ""Roy's classic trio "" consisting of Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish. It came out with 3 small I mean small plates in a tasting style display. The Ahi was great, the spices went well with the cool raw interior. The Butter fish was nice too with a sweet miso glaze on a bed or pillow in this case of black rice. I thought the salmon was a bit over cooked. After I had finished the three 2oz tastings I was still hungry. n nI am probably not the only one with this opinion as on both weekday visits we were one of two tables. n nI think if they want to increase the plate count they should lower the prices and or up the portion size.",1
"My boyfriend raved and raved about Winco and talked about his experiences going here often growing up in California. When they finally built out here, we ventured out to shop. Store front is large, in a good location with ample parking. Shopping carts are deeper than normal, which is smart. Store layout is somewhat of a maze in the beginning but is large inside with a lot of product. Prices are noticably lower on many items but not on everything. It might take me a couple more trips to know what to get here to save money and what I can continue to buy at my neighborhood store. Staff is also very helpful and we used our spend 50 get 10 off coupon. Shoppers bag their own groceries so dont expect that when you shop here. Overall, I liked Winco and will return!",2
"I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said! I went here for my birthday and it was such a nice and special occasion. Having Christopher cook for you and talk to you is such a unique dining experience and I wasn't disappointed. n nHowever! I would have appreciated being told to have cash up front. Also, it got really smokey in the restaurant it is so small and everyone's eyes were tearing up towards the end of the meal. n nI would recommend this place to anyone!",2
"Another yarn store that I get sucked into and can't seem to get out of without supervision. The downside is that the yarn, while great quality is VERY expensive. If you are looking for the highest quality this is you place. They carry all of the blends that are easy to work with, in every type of fiber. The staff is helpful. They have a lot of classes but most are geared toward knitting. Most places dothough, it's trendier thatn crocheting right now. nThey are pretty comfortable letting me wander around for 2 hours and will ask if they can help me a few times, but don't overdo it. nThe only reason I gave it 4 stars is the lack of inexpensive yarn. It's all pricey, none cheap or in between.",2
HORRIBLE! Made reservations here for 7 00 3 weeks ago for my 21st birthday dinner. Called the restaurant to verify our reservations and the hostess confirmed us for 7 00. Arrived at 7 00 to an extremely RUDE ma u00eetre d' named Tim who told us our reservations were at 6 30 not 7 00 even after we told him we confirmed earlier. He rudely told our party of 10 we would have to wait. After waiting for about 30 minutes and the employees making absolutely no acknowledgement of their mistake our party decided to leave. I find it unbelievable that the ma u00eetre d' did not even apologize and nobody in the restaurant tried to compensate for their mistake. I would never return to a restaurant with such rude employees!,1
"We've always had good luck with Vets, but our trip to All About Cats was the best experience we've had a vet ever. One of our cats has been in not so good health for the last couple months, and our other vets treated her for a UTI but she still seemed under the weather. They had even suggested the unthinkable as this cat is a senior cat. Knowing that our cat was still in her prime we went for a second opinion. I found reviews of AAC on other websites, and thought this could be a good place to go. The facility is one of the cleanest vets I've ever been into, and the staff is very friendly, very prompt and very caring. We were able to get an appointment with 2 days notice, which was great. When we met with the vet tech, she spent about 15 minutes with us going over the ins and outs of their philosophy and a bit of our cat's history. Once we met with the Dr. she did a thorough examination, and she spent over 30 minutes with us getting a feel for what was going on with our cat. We have never had that much time with a vet before. When we explained that our previous vet had suggested the unthinkable option this Dr. said she was not going to suggest that today.this is the kind of thinking I appreciate in any kind of Dr. After they ran tests on our cat, the Dr. spent another 15 minutes going over the results and the course of treatment. Our other vet didn't catch some other issues that were going on with our cat, and didn't fully treat the UTI. Now we have a positive course of action that will allow our cat to regain her health. We have decided to bring both our cats here now. nThe prices were pretty consistent with our other vet, and worth every penny.",2
"Tix4tonight t4t Im a person who is on both sides of the show market. So to give everyone a piece of mind and some educationing here is what you should know. n nT4t sells discounted shows, restaurants and golf tee times nThe way it works it's not a scam is they work with the box offices on getting seats in whatever areas the producers will allow. Some shows like any show at the V theatre wouldn't matter because it is first come first serve type of thing. But some of the major shows like Phantom or Blueman group hmm Venetian have sections reserved for tix4tonight customers. Of couse the early you buy your ticket the better the location. The staff knows generally where these are at. n nTix doesn't give you the ACTUAL TICKET! it's a VOUCHER! redeem it ASAP at the box office! this is purposely done. n nAlso your probably wondering,. ""is this the best deal? "" nWell that depends on how much homework you want to do. Obviously locals can get good deals already. If your not local which is what this service really caters to, find out about your show. I'd say check the boxoffice always. What deals do they have? And specials or promos? If none, which happens during the height of tourist season then Tix is a great alternative. nA few more tips! nThere are six locations! The busiest ones i'd say are the fashion show mall and the coke bottle. So expect a line in the morning. nThere is a service fee but there are coupons to cut it down. Check any magazine. Also they'll tell you about dinner discounts. A previous reviewer said all the food discounts they offered were horrible. What a load of ! Enoteca San Marco is fantastic, Penazzi, also a good deal is if you get the discount to Planet Hollywood Restaurant. It's actually better and cheaper then going to Mc Donalds. And you go whenever you want. n nThey also do discounts on Golf. not my area of expertise. But it's as legit as it gets. n nLast tip. Geez. I work for a show. So I know where the T4t people sit. it's not always bad. Don't assume you're sitting in the nose bleed section although i joke and tell people we give out complementary tissues ",2
"Julia S and I were on a top secret mission today for a certain someone's birthday that will remain unmentioned. We stopped in Delicias Colombianas to grap a quick coffee, I simply could not resist the happy, little meat pie empanadas.

"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU BLACK , All you will find here is minorities being racist to minorities Nick refused to cut my hair. I went here because by the recommendation of another posted review. If you cannot cut a regular guard 1 fade on a black guy you should not be cutting hair. End of story and shame on the owners for allowing this. n n nIn the alternative, I would recommend ""Nappy by Nature "" on Bethany Home Road or if you're at Baller status and you only want to make an appointment because you like to jump right in the chair I would go to ""the Art of Shaving "" at fashion square mall. Barbers in both locations know how to cut all types of hair.",1
Rude services. Nasty food. High price. n nI had bad diarrhea and my friend felt nausea after eat there. n nNot recommended and won't go back.,1
"I was excited that yet another restaurant opened in this location. It's convenient and a beautiful spot, yet it seems to have an invisible revolving door, so you never know what will be there from month to month or so it seems . n nSince West Addison is so new, I have to give a lot of leniency for working out the kinks. It's inevitable and forgivable. That being said, I promise to return and give them a second shot down the road. if they are still open. n nI agree with most of the kid related comments below. What are you? Bar or family restaurant? Even if you are a family restaurant, come on people, wrangle your offspring. Our generation was not brought up that way. If we were lucky enough to be taken out to eat, we were expected to behave properly. So true, Nick S., this is not Chuck E Cheese. n nBut I digress. As of this writing, the restaurant is just OK. The food was fine. The wine was over priced, tiny pours though I do like the stemless glasses , and the waitress had zero ZERO! personality. We observed some of the other servers around us and they all were personable, friendly, helpful. we were jealous. Ours sucked. I don't remember her name but she had short blonde hair and never smiled once. Not once. n nThe environment is super loud. Perhaps because of the low ceiling area in the back, where we sat. Up front has high, vaulted ceilings. Perhaps because of the drunken cougars at the next table. Or because of the maniacal children running around, screaming. Hard to say. If I give this place another shot, I'll bring a jacket it was chilly that night and sit on the patio. Less rugrats, cooler, quieter. And the nice waitress was working the patio!",1
"I wanted to leave a good review but after having gone twice, I just can't despite the sweet couple that works there. I don't do a lot of dry cleaning but just as someone had mentioned it, and partly my fault, I went to another dry cleaner that wasn't able to get an ink stain out and thought I'd give them a try. I went on vacation and picked up the shirt two weeks later and was charged not 5 which I find already very pricey for a shirt but 5.50 as the owner asked if I could pay in cash and since I'm pretty much someone who never carries it, he asked if he could add 50 cents due to the ""high card fees "". I might have been in a good mood or something because I'm sure others wouldn't have been so kind when asked that. However.my thank you was a bitter one. Ever heard of ""cost of doing business "". You don't ask your customers to take on additional fees.if you want them to remain customers. Last time I'll be visiting them sadly.",1
"Hard to find anything wrong with this place. Lechon Asado and large avocado salad for lunch, 20 bucks. Everything good. The lechon so tender and juicy. The 20 bucks was for two people.

"03 10 13 BRUNCH n nI purchased a TravelZoo coupon, entitling spouse and I to a Sat or Sun brunch for 2 w unlimited ""champagne "" sparkling wine for 26 1.58 tax, paid at venue, and tip . n nWhy not, I thought. We've never been. n nWell, there are worse buffets in Las Vegas Valley I'm talking off Strip , but this has to be the worst buffet on the Strip. But it's at least passable I've been to some off Strip that would curl your hair! , and there were some midway to high points in the adventure. n nCashier was efficient and accommodating. Table service was great, lovely lady, not very friendly but attentive. She poured us our ""champagne "", Wycliff just short of being bad, but drinkable by itself, so I was happy. I ordered an orange juice, swear to god, it tasted like TANG! Childhood memory! EW! n nSo what did we try? A LOT, but nothing from Mexico or Italy. n nWe got lots of stuff from the Asian section. n Edimames already shelled, nice. n Japanese potato salad nice. n A little sushi only the octopus was good, the others were grocery store style. n Chinese buns spouse liked them, pork seafood, I only had the seafood, too doughy. n Potstickers good. Spouse liked these quite a bit, actually. n nThen on to the seafood section. n Large shrimps good. But the cocktail sauce was obviously from a jar. Took a little drawn butter instead back to the table, that was nice. n Bay shrimps, various preparations avoid. n Ceviches avoid. n Crab legs the thinnest, chewiest, worst crab legs I've ever encountered. I took only one, ate half, yuck. Never again. n nSpouse had lots more. What was it? Oh, biscuits gravy I tasted, so so , some kind of potatoes gratin, what else? He was OK with all of it. Me, I had read the ups and downs of the prime rib. ""Only get it rare "", some have posted here. Well, spouse came back with a small non rare, and it was so so, he only ate half. I went, got bloody rare, huge piece, ate nearly the entire thing, I was very happy! Not the greatest prime rib, of course, but still, it was really good, at the end of the savory foods. n nIf there were ever a next time, I think I'd stick to the Asian section, try some of those egg drop soups, etc. n nDesserts? Sad. ""Mirage bread pudding "" was a mishmash of runny bottom of pan with hard ass top of portion. Not good. The creme brulee was so so. The only recommended ones we'd say would be the raspberry bar very fruity, probably jam, but who cares! and the marshmallows covered in dark chocolate which were light after a huge meal like ours . n nTo sum up. I would never go there and pay full price. I'd rather spend that money at the new Bacchanal Caesars, Wicked Spoon Cosmo, Bellagio, ARIA, etc. BUT if you get comp'd or get a great coupon deal, like that TravelZoo, I'd go and make the best of it.",1
"Very disappointed in this show. We kept waiting for the show to begin and it never quite did. The entire show just didn't make any sense.

I called last week to ask about selling my clothes. I was told to nHold while they set the phone down and I could hear everything.

She apologized and I just reiterated how rude she was for doing that. n nToday I decided to visit and speak to them in person and get a feel for the store. I arrived around 11 am. There was no one in there. No one greeted me. I browsed the clothes and clearance rack and then decided to check out the shoes. I was wanting to ask a question about something specific I was looking for and stood at the counter for a few minutes. No one came up to help me. n nHorrible customer service and is like to warn future customers to steer clear in hopes they go out of business.

"AVOID this place at all costs. I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life. n nCame here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area. Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys. Ok. I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here. My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time. When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was ""too drunk. "" ""Excuse me? "" I asked her, ""I've had 2 drinks!

I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong! I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return. That's when the doorman told me, ""That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here. "" That's when I completely lost my shit. After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, ""you're just planning on taking the cab to your car. "" I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there. n nI have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that. I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around 25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.",1

"Knowing that it was going to be an awesome Saturday evening weather wise, I booked our first reservation on OpenTable for the Peculiar Rabbit, hoping to dine outside. When we arrived, the hostess ""couldn't find "" our reservation but OpenTable was quick to send me an email later letting me know that I didn't show up for the reservation I made , and we were seated in a ""dining room "" in a side room off the first floor, back in the very corner. It was great for conversation in an otherwise noisy bar restaurant, but the room had no atmosphere whatsoever. It felt like a cafeteria dining room, and put an immediate damper on our first impression visit. We stuck with it, though, trying to make the most out of the situation. n nWe started with the pretzel bites appetizer because it came with a ""beer cheese dipping sauce. "" You only get a tiny ramekin of ""dip, "" which was actually just the beer cheese soup. Our server did kindly bring us more upon our request, though. I assumed the beer cheese dip would be different than the beer cheese soup since they'd require different consistencies, but since I'm not a professionally trained chef, what do I know? I know not to order them again or recommend them, that's what I know. n nThe pretzel bites were a bit greasy and we realized that we had to ask our server for napkins silverware, which the hostess neglected to give us upon seating us. Seriously is checking off reservations, seating people, and bringing them menus silverware too much to ask of one person? Is it too much to remember? n nMy partner ordered the Vegetable Wrap and loved it. I ordered the Lamb Burger and loved it. It was juicy and had a lot of flavor. As a side, I went with French Fries, and they had a lot of flavor, too. They had a crispy coating on the outside and were an excellent complement to the burger. n nHaving never dined at the restaurant before, I asked our friendly server Christian about the other floors of the building. He told us about them and recommended we walk up to the rooftop for the view. The second floor wasn't that great for dining, but when we got up to the rooftop, we loved the view and saw open tables. Why wasn't this an option for us? n nSo because the food and service was great, we'll return, but we'll know what to do next time.",2
"I started a yelp account just so I could express my absolute disgust in the ""management "" or lack there of at this joke of a cab company. I've dealt with these idiots for years pretending like they arrived when they had not or taking their sweet time when it was crucial to be on time. They consistently skip reservations to take ""better "" ones so they can rip those people off too.its not rocket science but this night was unique. They deserve one star because of the 1 person that was kind of helpful. n nI called 4hrs ahead for my mom to be to be picked up 7pm on a friday, a busy time for cabbies. After waiting 20 mins passed the time of the expected available, I call to see what happened. I explain my mother is waiting and want to know what was going on. I'm connected to some little prick dispatcher. n Enter Robert rather rude and defensive before he even knew anything was wrong. n nRobert informed me the cab arrived at the expected time and called several times. When I explained that was not true and impossible because my mother, who is a Senior, has been waiting in the cold since 7pm and is the only person on the premises, he informed me that ""she should have been ready in time or answered her phone. "" As if she didnt think of looking at her phone to check. n n I natural repiled, ""WTF! YOUR driver told a damn lie and can you send another cab ASAP bcuz her phone is almost dead?! "" Robert tells me that 3rd parties can't place reservations.although the cabbies can ""allegedly "" act as 3rd parties themselves to set up prostitution drugs for other customers, I couldn't help my mom in the cold. ? nI informed him the phone is dying and I dont want the same thing happening with the driver missing her so and that i needed to place the order for her. He says "" uh, no. "" n nI hung up on him and placed another order explaining the previous situation. The rep sent another cab and apologized for the confusion. After another hour, I get a msg from my mom saying there is STILL no cab! n nNow 2hrs later, I call back. Remember Robert, that a passive aggressive halfass dispatcher with limited power and no control in his life? Well, this individual opted not send another cab knowing she was out there in the cold in the dark and because of their mistake. Then he used the excuse that he ""didn't like that I cussed at him on the phone. "" n nAt him? I'm sure my requests colorful language was A LOT milder than the average customer that calls with a complaint but this man wanted to make a point to make things harder for all of us. I was connected again with him, on just principal alone, to make sure he understood what ""cussing AT him "" really meant. HatedIt n nI can only direct my anger specifically at his incompetence and not the rep or the cabbie. This guy was on a complete power trip.with no customer service skills and was rude before he even heard what happened. n nI would not recommend or use this company if my life depended on it, I was on fire and there was an emergency evacuation of the city!",1
Im a sushi fanactic. Tonight was the first time i ate here. This sushi restaurant didnt seem to suprise me. The service was sad. The girl had ignore me and walked away when i went up to the register and try to pay. The food doesnt taste like how they appear. The salad is full of watered down veggies. The sushi is rolled loosely so it would look big. Not one of the best but is the worst. Never again will i come here for dinner. Yama sushi on maryland prky and flamingo is good. Sushi Mon on Sahara is awesome. Ra at the fashion show mall is also delicious! ,1
Came in and got all the help I could need and found what I was looking for. nice clean store.,2
"Visited FEZ last week while on vacation taking in some Spring Training and Suns games. After a Suns game, I did a 'Google search' on late night eateries in Phoenix, and found FEZ among the ""Top 10 "". I suppose I might be too old to appreciate 'hip' or 'new age', or maybe I was too hungry, but I did not like FEZ. I ordered the FEZ burger, and asked our waiter to put the cinnamon pears on the side because I just wasn't so sure of the combination of flavors. The burger arrived with the pears on it! I was going to say something to the waiter, and send the burger back to the kitchen, but I decided to scrape them off. After all, it was almost 10 30 pm, and I was starving! Not even scraping them off made the burger taste any better. YUK! The flavors of the cinnamon pears, feta, some weird bbq sauce, and fried onion straws, and a spicy aioli sauce, just didn't blend to my culinary pallet. I ended up taking the burger all apart and just eating the meat. I was totally disappointed with the burger. The service was below par. I won't be back.",1
I've been here a couple times on business trips to Scottsdale and I'm always impressed. Excellent quality. Restaurant is small and popular so it's best to go early or late.,2
"I think we may have caught this place on a bad night but I stand by my two stars. The only reason it didn't get one was because the poutine had the potential of being good. but it was cold, hence the poor review. I think our food was mistakenly taken to two other tables before making its way to us. n nService was quite slow, orders were being confused left right and centre, and to boot the bathroom was stuck right in the middle of the dining area. Not very appealing.",1
"After hearing about this place on my HOA fb group I had to check it out.WOW! Not only were they super friendly, but they brought out all kinds of samples! Great sweet and savory flavors! I picked up two of their ""small "" bags that I thought were pretty generous for about 8 total. Perfect for adding to a gift basket. He even threw in toothpicks an napkins in the bag great local business!",2
"Haven't eaten in the restaurant, being new to the area we called in an order for take out. On the plus side, it was ready in 15 minutes. Negatives, the telephone answering person spoke English so poorly I wasn't sure what we would get. The food was on balance pretty dreadful. Bland, gelatinous to a fault, every dish tasted like pablum except the shrimp fried rice. We won't do this again.",1
"Oh.much much better than JET. Of course, no cover for us girls. As it should be.it was a bachelorette party for Pary B. The Hilton sisters were here. Heard Paris sing happy birthday to her sister. Haha. She sucks. But overall, the music was good, the drinks were expensive and there was lots of fun company. Oh but it was ridiculously crowded. We danced off the dance floor. Haha.actually we made our own dance floor by some tables. Good times. I know it was because our very own bachelorette of the night got kicked out for being too drunk.",2
I've recently started hiking Piestewa Peak I feeling like I'm cheating on Camelback and I think I'm in love! This is a great hike that gives the stairmaster a new name. The views are amazing and its not too crowded. Parking can be hard to find but it's worth the hunt for a spot to hike this awesome trail!,2
"Truly horrible. The food is exceedingly overpriced even by Vegas standards for subpar quality. My boyfriend and I ordered steak dinners that were worse than Denny's. At least Denny's doesn't charge you up the you know what. For two overdone steaks with supposedly ""steamed "" vegetables thar were in fact raw, we paid over 50 bucks. We might as well have gone to a quality steakhouse for a few more dollars. The service is below low. There was one poor guy working half the entire restaurant and it was only 10pm. The hostesses were flat out rude and we would NEVER go back again. They need to get get their act together pronto.",1
"I really hate to do this, because I have been a fan of the Merc Bar for years, but its a must. My fiance I were looking for a place to entertain our wedding party the weekend before our wedding and it was clear to us that the Merc Bar would be the perfect place. We love the atmpsphere. It usually has a nice mature crowd. The service is usually good. It was perfect. n nUnfortunately, it was the management and not the lounge that ruined our perspective of the venue. The manager Tommy was slow nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of.i.e. Whats your process for group reservations. n nHe seemed annoyed that I conntact him and unwilling to make time for us. After several incomplete emails he finally called me, at my request, but it became clear, after 5 mins on the phone, that he did not want our business. It was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills. n nSince, the goal of the evening is relax enjoy our time with our friends, not to worry about bad service, we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit. We need a place with a more mature management staff.so, we're going with the Montelucia. Its a nice upscale resort, with an awesome spa, a very nice lounge live music on Saturday night, a great pool nice rooms. Truly perfect.",1
"I stopped in for a quick breakfast so I didn't get coffee, but the breakfast sandwich I had was AMAZING. They have books and games too, so I will be back for coffee sometime. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the girls working seemed a little annoyed. It may have just been a stressful morning for them.",2
This place gets a 1 star because the server was nice besides that WOW We ordered the spinach artichoke Dip I have had at other applebees It came out looking like someone dumped a can of Cream spinach in a bowl it didn't even have the cheese on top just green mush. The chips looked like the bottom of the bag and tasted like it to stale and super salty. I ordered the Chicken Penne it came out with mushy over cooked noodles with Alfredo thrown on top the chicken looked like scraps of a leftover plate. All I can say it Yuk. The bread was still frozen in the center. I have had this dish at other Applebees and it never looked or tasted like this one. My Husband got Fish Chips We also have had at other Applebees This one came out on a plate not a basket. The fish was a dark Brown color like it was fried in old grease and under the fish was a pool of yellow grease. The forgot the Fry's Haha they actual forgot the chip part of Fish Chips. We called the server over and right away she knew what was wrong and stated she could tell the Fish was way to greasy. The Manager came over and just brushed everything off. I do not believe he tried to fix the situation. We did not want replacement food so we tipped the waitress because it's not her fault the Kitchen sucks and we left never to return. Applebees Surprise is off the list. Worst Applebees we have ever been to. You are better off with Burger King.,1
I love this place! The resturant is delicious. We waited awhile to get our food but it was worth the wait! Go there and expect to enjoy a delicious glass of wine while waiting to have a fabulous dinner!,2
"July 2, 2011 Saturday dinner 8 30 PM n2 adults and a teenager n nAtmosphere 4 stars nFood 2 stars nService 1 star n nBackground After a long day of driving from Reno we wanted Italian close to our hotel. n nAtmosphere The best thing going with this place. Lofting ceilings with great colors covering the walls make for a warm inviting place. n nFood nAppetizer Free bread came in a small basket, it contained three triangular cracker thin bread slices covered in seasoning and a chuck of soft bread. The cracker bread was seasoned, looked, and tasted like pizza. They could have offered to bring more bread when it was gone. If I was eating some pasta as my meal I would have liked it to arrive without me begging. n nMain Course They did not have any stuffed pasta that I was interested in. So I went with the sliced steak salad. The steak was over peppered and the medallion pieces needed to be cut. The lettuce was nothing special, mostly iceberg chopped into small squares. The highlight of the meal was the candied pecans. This comment you could put under service or here, the menu indicates that steak will be cooked to order. The waiter never asked and I forgot as it took a long time to place our meal order with him. n nDessert skipped it n nService This was really lacking. The floor was simply nasty. Noodles all over the floor next to wear I sat. As we sat there I noticed a Gatorade bottle on the floor next to me after the lady at the next table over placed in on the floor before they left. The busy boy must have not noticed it as he kicked it under the table. I typically only drink water with my meal now, and when you fill a 12 ounce glass completely with ice, you better be coming back with more water frequently. But not the case here, only once was my water refilled, placing the glass at the edge of the table should all I have to do. As we were finishing up our meal, a different bus boy took care of the other table next to us. The table was covered in a table cloth. When he placed the new one on the table it was like he was making a bed up and down with cloth. I know it was a hot night but I really do not need a table cloth fan next to me.",1
"Wow.talk about a backwards shop. The computer system is from the early80's and I had to use a phone to make a Western Union transfer. If there ever was a location that required updating, this would be the one. It doesn't even need to be updated to modern day, the late 90's would be fine as well.",1
"Come on Man! n nAre you kidding me 4 and 5 stars, this is at the very best 2 3 stars. I know I have a tough rating system, for me a 5 would be like a Nola's, or Brennans in New Orleans, Table 29 in Napa just too level set. n nNow I understand a lot of people mistake a lot of food for good food, as Italian goes this was run of the mill. I also now understand after local friends maybe no longer my friends suggested this place for dinner why some of the comments on yelp were made. I do admit when it comes to Italian food I am a snob, that's why I avoid American Italian restaurants when possible, because I usually am disappointed, but because of the good ratings on Yelp I caved this time. n nFirst the reason it takes a while for food, is that it is a small place, and they use boxed pasta which is 12 minutes cooking time. You would assume home made Italian would include fresh pasta, and spices. n nI ordered the rice balls that according to the menu were one of their special dishes. All I got was something mushy with gooey tasteless cheese, and tomato sauce? The rice balls I have had are rice stuffed with cheese, deep fried, and some nice marinara sauce on top with some fresh basil. n nMy friend suggested the meatballs, another mistake. Yes there were 3 large mushy, tasteless balls of something with the same tasteless cheese, and unidentifiable sauce. n nWe also have the anti pasta plate which was the highlight of the dinner, how can you mess up salad, cheese, veggies and meat. n nFor the main course they ordered for us the sausage and peppers, and I can't even remember the last dish for the same reasons as listed above, more boxed pasta with tasteless cheese, and uninspired tomato sauce a little basil, and oregano would be nice . n nNow if you are looking for off the strip Italian, lots of food for a reasonable price this is it. n nIf you are looking for good Italian off the strip I would suggest Panvino, you will pay a little more, but not regret it the next day. n nI try and support small local business when I travel, but I cannot recommend Montesano's.",1
