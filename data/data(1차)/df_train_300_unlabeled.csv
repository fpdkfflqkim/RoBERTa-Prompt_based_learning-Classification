"I stopped in with some time to spare and not knowing what to expect. I tried to ignore the sign out front that claimed it was the best deli this side of New York. Overall, I had a great experience. n nI mentioned I was escaping a baby shower at my apartment. They sat me and immediately gave me the space I needed. I ordered a beer which came quickly and ended up picking the Italian sub. n nOnce I had my full meal, one of the main things I appreciated was the space the waitress gave me. She even said for me to ""take my time "" a few times since I first sat. n nI love a good Italian sub and was excited to try it. My first thought was that it looked small. Any negativity evaporated once I tried it. The sandwich was thick and very spicy. Overall a great sub! n nI highly recommend stopping at Sal's of you are in town.",2
"This place is just plain rank. We were seated late the food came cold and late and the time between the first plate and the last plate brought to our table was over 20 mins. I do not care if they comped the appetizers or the last entree' the place is a joke, and some loser in the bathroom asked me Hurry up while I was peeing in the urinal! It almost got violent. Not only is the restaurant a loser the customers are also.",1
"Terrible customer service! I am waiting 2.5 hours now to fly home on my scheduled flight. I just watched an earlier flight take off with empty seats. I asked gate agent Miguel Cintron in Charlotte to place me on the earlier flight, as the pleasant agent in Jackson did earlier. Miguel Cintron told me that I would have to pay 75 because I am not a Silver member. Why would I want to endure more shoddy customer service to become a Silve member? I won't. There is nothing special about US Airways' routes or schedules. n nUPDATE After emailing US Airways, I receivedan email from Deb, one of their customer service people. The message only reiterated the policy I had complained about. I replied with a message beginning with ""thanks for the semi canned email. "" This, finally, garnered some real customer service. Deb called me, apologized, and admitted that the policy was flawed. She also said that she would be suggesting a policy change at an executive board meeting. Whether or not anything comes from it, I was happy to finally get someone reasonable to consider my criticism. Boycott lifted. One star added.",1
"chandler fashion center was very big! we grabbed a directory and planned our route. n nthey had a lot of your basic stores something you'd find in your everyday, run of the mill mall. except that these stores were on steroids! the forever 21 i walked into was magnificent! n nit would be good to spend and entire shopping day here.",2
"This is an easy place to pick for lunch with my work friends. They offer a nice selection of salads where even a half order is too much for one person like other reviewers, the caramelized peach is my favorite. Artichoke and spinach dip is always tasty, pear gorgonzola pizza is delicious, the new bianco flat bread is tasty, and my lunch companions always get different salads and pizzas and are always pleased. n nThey did switch to sourdough bread for a start not my favorite but theirs isn't too powerful. I liked the herb oil but that didn't get to our table with the last visit so it might be out already. n nParking is easy, at least until they replace On the Border which is across the ""street "" and the best place to park when you visit. Service is mostly good but we have had a couple of bad experiences, not enough to change my opinion though. Ask for salad dressing on the side if you're concerned about getting too much, I'm not a fanatic but they load it at times and it will turn a nice salad into a drippy slaw. The guy that manages this place during the day does a great job and always looks tired, I would too if I had to deal with running a place like this. n nIt's a chain and and a tad overpriced.that being said, it's a pretty good option when you can't figure out what else to do. A true 3.5 but I'll round it up for how hard they try.",2
"Chips, Chips and more Chips! There chips and salsa are sooo good. Tacos are delish and price is reasonable for the amount of food you get. Plus they have Happy Hour taco specials.",2
We stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we caught our flight. For hunger purposes it served its need. I've eating many Asian soups before and this one wasn't anything to brag about. The shrimp wonton noodle soup was equal to ramen noodle with delicate dumplings. For the price just grab a bagel or something else if you are famished or go in the gift shop or better yet wait until you arrive at the airport.,1
Perfect lunch food.,2
"This review is for the Honey Buns restaurant in the G Mart. n nI ordered the Vietnamese, chinese and egg custard buns! They were delicious. My favorite was the Vietnamese bun, which had egg, Chinese sausage and ground pork as the fillings. n nThey had so many different buns there and all had descriptions so you know what you get. They were freshly made and looked yummy when she packed up our order. We took ours home and had them a few hours later and they were still very good. Next time will eat them right there. n nI think they take cash only but was super cheap. Each bun range cost about 1.25 1.65. Totally worth it and what a great snack while you grocery shop!",2
"I had never been here before, so I was really unsure on what to expect. We sat on the patio, which I highly recommend, and the atmosphere was great. The food was delicious too! I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and my friend had the Bungalow salad. We also ordered the goat cheese as an appetizer. What I didn't like is that they charged an 6 because we asked for veggies to eat with our goat cheese instead of the flatbread listed on the menu. However, I didn't complain or ask questions, so they might have reversed that charge if I had asked. One last thing, prepare to spend quite a bit because this place is not for a light wallet. especially if you plan on having a drink or two.",2
"I haven't written a review in a long time, but I felt compelled to after eating at this place last week. I came across it on a whim appointment in the area , and it's one of the best BBQ experiences I've had in recent memory. n nI chose the two meat combo, beef brisket and pulled pork the old favorites . Waited about 15 minutes for the food during the busy lunch hour there was a line out the door . Both choices were tender and delicious. I also overheard some people talking about the baby back ribs, so I'd like to try that my next visit in. n nMy only complaint minus a star is the fact that they don't tell you that they put pickles and green onions as garnish on the plate. Call me traditional, but I don't like it when vegetables ""taint "" my meat. As soon as they touch the rest of the food, the flavor has been compromised. So, if you're like me no one is , save yourself some trouble and ask for ""no greens. """,2
"Since '99 I remember my first EDC, since then it has always been my favorite. Through the years the scene got smaller, but EDC never stopped breathing. Today it is a spectacular wonderland full of life, music, love and everything nice. The tickets may cost a premium, but the production value is through the roof! Everywhere you go there is some wonderful art installation, totally interactive and euphoric. This is not just a music festival or event, it is an experience to be lived! I love you, EDC. Always have been, always will be, simply the best!",2
"We love this place. The smothered chicken, red snapper, greens and corn bread are delicious. Actually everything I've had has been terrific. Friendly service too. If you like soul food this is THE place to go!",2
"First time I went opening night there was no Guiness on tap.OK, no biggy. Second time I went the fish and chips was really salty. It happens, I'll live. Third time I went it took a loooong time for service and they were not busy. I guess somebody didn't show up for work. n n Fourth and last time I went I walked in and they were playing really loud head banger music. Like when you walk into a place before they open and the cleaning guy is cranking AC DC I turned around and walk out. I think I will give this place a year or two to get it together before going back. Too bad because its on my way home.",1
"Had an electrical fire today, after I got locked out of my house yesterday with a door malfunction, and the A C has been out for 2 days now. But it's only 94 degrees in the house, so totally not too bad.",1
"I went to the Vegas Pink's based on the reputation of the stand in LA which is legendary. I was sadly disappointed by this location. The hot dog was barely cooked and the chili was bland. Outdoor seating is the only option. It was also overpriced by about double of the original franchise. I wouldn't have minded paying but the meal was just not good. Come on Pink's! You can do better! I have not been to the original but I will visit someday. n nCheck out my blog ""Tales of a Flying Brick "" for more details.",1
"I used to ""like "" hot dog before I stopped by the DD. Now, I must say I love it. n nThe toppings is what makes this place unique. Most of the menu is named after streets in Dormont and each has its own unique toppings and sauce. The bun is soft and seems fresh out of bakery. n nI've been here twice since moving to Dormont and I've tried the Texas and the Arkansas Dog so far. The Arkansas Dog was amazingly good with hints of horseradish sauce. I will definitely be stopping here more often for a quick bite and my goal is try a different hot dog each time. n nIt's cash only so make sure to bring ""little "" cash.",2
"I've been going to him for any kind of alterations. He is the best. I've been going to him for all my suits, pants and shirts. Now I finally realize that you feel good when you have great fitting outfits. n nJoe knows his stuff! He's been doing this for more than 3 decades, and with that experience you know that you'll be more than happy when you wear them. n nI've been going to different tailors before, now that I've found Joe, never I will go to another tailor. n nThank you, Joe!",2
The best. Hands down. n nFound the place by accident. The strip mall is crazy but the food is AMAZING! You'll never waste your time looking for a great Italian place ever again!,2
"We come here regularly and are never disappointed. Saturday mornings are very quiet. we never have to wait. Service is somewhat slow occasionally but it is so relaxed that it feels nice on a lazy morning. The prix fixe is a nice choice as it comes with coffee, which is hot and flavorful. The munion crepe is excellent as are the Mona eggs and the savory French toasts. We always enjoy our Saturday mornings when we can sit with our coffee and read books. We love caffe Mona!",2
"If I could rate this hotel as 1 2 a star, I would. I was looking to find a decent hotel to spend a summer weekend in Vegas with my boyfriend. Sure, Luxor had a great budget friendly rate to offer for a weekend stay. That may have been the problem you get what you pay for. n nUpon arrival, the concierge didn't even confirm the type of room I had requested. Instead, he just gave me a standard room when I clearly requested an upgrade as part of my MLife rewards. I decided not to ruin my trip over that ""small "" matter. That became the least of my worries as the weekend progressed. On the first night, I noticed an awful smell coming from the A C vent, and realized that it was leaking and the water was being absorbed in the carpet leaving a humid smell. I called guest services and they assured me that someone would take care of the problem in the next hour. After waiting an hour, my boyfriend and I decided to leave so we could make it to our dinner reservation, and I called guest services to let them know. n nAfter a long night out, we returned only to find that nothing had been taken care of. I was soo upset at this point and called for the third time! The representative told me they couldn't switch rooms and that instead, he could give me a 20 discount for the inconvenience. I decided that if they took care of it by the next day, it wouldn't be a problem. Day 2 came along and still, the A C was leaking. I talked to a representative in person, and they offered me yet another discount. Why can't these people just move our room and fix the damn leak?! n nFinally, we checked out on the 3rd day and made it safely back home to San Diego. Upon our return, we noticed that my boyfriends 2 pairs of shoes were missing! We had a bellman pick up our things when we had checked out and they had lost the bag of shoes, about 150 value for both pairs. I was sooo furious, and this time, I called and asked for the Manager of VIP sales. After making a big fuss, he decided to waive our 1 night stay since he couldn't find the bag. n nAll in all, it was a horrible experience, to say the least. Customer service should be priority, and for a Las Vegas Strip hotel, Luxor is not worth a dime! Spend your money elsewhere and save yourself the hassle of dealing with incompetent and unprofessional hotel staff.",1
I got take out from here today for lunch and it was ok. Portion size was good but I'd prefer to go to pei wei. Their food is a lot bettee plus thai house messed up my order.,1
"This place is fantastic. The sushi is fresh and the folks are so nice. If you go, you really have to try the twice cooked smoked salmon Maki It was FABULOUS. My fiance always get the cowboy Maki. The miso soup is wonderful and they always have specials. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because they close from 230 430p and sometimes that's the perfect lunch time not a crowd but the place is so good, my fiance and I waited for an 1 2 hour until they re opened. Love this place!",2
"So I've eaten at Flo's three times this week and had to review it. I've been coming to Flo's for about three years now and have enjoyed the experience every time. I will say this though, its loud. It can make it difficult to hear and carry on a conversation especially if you have a big group. n nNonetheless, the food is yummy and always comes out quick. I usually get the same thing, garlic chicken and I ask them to spice it up. I've gotten some friends hooked on it as well. The owner manager is always walking around, not sure if her name is Ms Flo, but she is always asking patrons if everything is ok. My answer is always yes. Btw, you can order to go as well. n nThere are several other Flo's around town but this one is by far my favorite. Oh its way cheap too.",2
"Que c'est chouette ! J'adore ce caf u00e9 dans villeray c'est beau, le service est hyper agreable, meme les patisseries sont bonnes. Courrez y !",2
Best BBQ I've had on west valley. Definitely a place to take people from out of town especially with it being located in west gate.,2
"After a not so satisfactory experience at this salon, I contacted the manager, Jill, to see what she might be able to do for me. Well, she went above and beyond to turn my experience around. n nShe offered for me to come back in for a massage with one of their best therapists, George. He gave me an incredible sports massage and was able to really work on my whole body and tailor it specifically to the pain I was feeling from my yoga teacher training. I felt like a whole new person after the massage. I normally prefer quiet massages, but George shared so much information and really talked through everything he was doing during the massage and not only was I relaxed but I learned so much about my body and muscles during it. n nThe management team here really does care about their clients and making sure they always leave happy. If you want a great massage, call Jill and have her set you up with George!",2
Not bad pizza but what made my review so low was the 10 delivery price. Kinda high and not sure why so high!,1
"Just like everyone said, this place is loud. n nSo I went on a date here and it actually helped. My date had to sit next to me for us to even carry a conversation so that was nice. The service was good, our waiter was very sociable and had many suggestions. Now to the food. n nWe got the pretzels with cheese and honestly, I prefer the mall pretzels with cheese. The salmon was also only okay. The drinks were refreshing but I was really turned off by how dark and loud the place was. Was definitely over hyped for me, probably wouldnt go back",1
My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. nOnce the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.,1
"Why all the bad reviews? They're fast at making sandwiches and I have never had an issue or a problem. It's a fast food chain. Yes, they yell when you walk in the door. It's called ""greeting the customer enthusiastically "". Would you rather they didn't acknowledge you at all and avoid any sort of eye contact, seemingly intent on rushing you through the already expeditious ordering process? Lighten up.",2
The best chili cheese dogs ever grew up on them in Cali now here in Az still awesome oove them,2
"After years of spending hundreds of dollars a week in dry cleaning, I discovered Montecarlo Cleaners about 5 years ago. I love this place. I was a little hesitant at the beginning, I couldn't believe they were charging only 1.99 per piece, no matter what piece. I gave it a try and I was impressed. In five years I have only had one incident with a piece being damaged, however the owner himself, Frank, gave me a call and paid for my husband's shirt. They raised the price to 2.25 a piece now, but it is still an awesome deal compare to other places. I don't understand why you have to charge almost 10 for a dress to be dry cleaned. I will gladly recommend this place to anyone.",2
"Napkins shed little white flakes all over your clothes, the lobster and and soups are great, but the crab was bitter.",1
"Valentines 2 14 11 n nThis is the casino we stopped into right next to the rainbow casino in downtown Henderson. Again it is just a small smokey dive, a little bigger than the rainbow casino. The staff here was rude but the beer was only 1 so it evens out. n nNot much to see but might check out their mexican cantina at some point.",1
"As of today's date, they DESPERATELY need a new speaker box! It's the ones you see in the comedies that cuts out half of your order. For people like my fianc u00e9 and myself who order custom food, that SUCKS. n nThis location was initially better a couple years ago, but it has been going downhill. Not really sure what happened. T n nThe boo has given up on ordering quesadillas at this location. Every time they are bad. It's either they add the sauce he asks for no sauce , they overcook them wtf? , they don't add enough cheese mmm dry tortilla. , or most recently they add a RIDICULOUS amount of onion. This is new. They never had onion in their quesadillas before. He gave it to me upon that discovery and I, the Onion Queen, deemed it too onion y. Yikes. For reference I enjoy eating onions raw as well as every other way you can eat them. n nService is slow even when no one's in line. Overall food quality is still good for Taco Bell, but I really wish they'd add Diet Mountain Dew to their fountain. ARG.",1
Taco Bell or frozen dinner would put this place to shame. Cold food bad service! I wish I could give no stars.,1
Mayne this place gave me the bubble ngutts. Don't know why I ate here before checking the ratings stomach still feels like crap the day after. At least I got a balloon hat tho.,1
"I saw a stylist at the Chandler store. I took pictures in of how I wore my hair during the summer. I wanted that style and she said she could do it. It was an elegant hairstyle, about four inches long. My hair is now about an inch long around my face, less in many places, and about two inches everywhere else. I did not get anything near the style I showed her. I really look like someone put a bowl on my head and cut it. It is an awful style for me. And I did not even ask for a new style! I do not know why stylists feel they must do something different even when they say they will not. If they can't do something you are asking for, they should say so and I would go elsewhere. This stylist was recommended by friends and when I saw them last night they wanted to know why I didn't go to their stylist. When I said I did, they were flabbergasted! They both agree my hair looks terrible. Now, It will be at least two months before it grows out again. n nI will not go back there and I cannot recommend them, especially this stylist.",1
"Wow talk about bad service! Where do I start, let's just say my chicken teriyaki was cold, you have to get up for your own refills, and the waitress was extremely rude. I don't often give a bad yelp review but this place is Bad. After I watched the owner server sneeze in their hand and then proceed to deliver food I was like wow. I wonder if small business is required to take a food handlers safety course in Vegas? Over all the place is NASTY do not waste your hard earned .",1
For some reason locals love this place. I am not one of those people. I've eaten many a meals here and always wondered why it was so busy. The one thing I do like is the live music. If you long for old school vegas stop by the bar and listen to the band. Eat dinner somewhere else first.,1
"Pizza Hut is absolutely to be avoided at all costs. It is disgusting. It makes Duner's, located in the same shopping center, seem appealing, and you can see that it too gets one star from me. That is all.",1
"First time ever at Lawry's in Vegas. Small place, more intimate. Same concept, food still delicious, great service. I had a great time. If you havent been to Lawry's Vegas, its worth checking it out. Imagine walking from your Hotel on the strip to Lawry's? Too bad its far away from the strip.",2
"Hands down the best club in vegas. n nEverytime I go to vegas this is my must spot for Saturday night but I hear its great all weekend long, even Mondays! n nThis place has over 1000 reviews so i'll spare you the redundant details and focus on my tips advice if you're a first timer. n nIf you're doing the general admission e ticket thing the lines arent as bad as they may look. I've waited in line on Saturday night their busiest night on regular weekends, holiday weekends, and major boxing weekends mayweather and have never had to wait longer than 30 minutes. It moves fairly quickly. Only time I waited longer was memorial weekend but thats just a well known crazy night and well worth the wait no matter how long it took. On any night you better get in line by 11 11 30'ish or all bets are off, including price of admission which I hear goes up after 12. n nOn busy night the dancefloor can get completely gridlocked. Even though I like to dance I try to avoid that situation for numerous reasons. There is room to dance up by the main level of tables. Thats where i'll go if its too crazy. A place to dance where you can still enjoy the atmosphere without getting bumped into a million times. n nI hear lots of complaints about the bars but its not that bad. They get busy and it can be a bit of a wait but not too bad if you're good at picking your spots. I like to go to the one on the other side of the pool because its the furthest from the club. n nDrink prices? Who cares. It's vegas. You shouldn't be in vegas if money is an issue. Thats like going to the Oscars but complaining that you have to wear a tuxedo and take a limo. Please! n nSame goes for the dress code guys . Dress to impress, it's Vegas, not some local watering hole in the middle of nowhere. As with most clubs in vegas dress shoes are a must. I would avoid wearing anything even resembling a tennis shoe, even if its a solid black brown color dressy looking tennis shoe. XS has staff that will walk up and down the line and literally kick you out if you are not dressed properly. Dress at your own risk! n nMusic, I hear alot of complaints from people like myself who enjoy hip hop r b. Yes the DJ's will bombard you with house techno EDM but you just have to grin and bear it. Its the hottest club in the world so you just have to tolerate it. Once I start drinking I don't care. i'll even dance to it. I'm buzzed and enjoying myself surrounded by hot girls in a great club, I could care less what they're playing. Haha. n nAll in all this place is kinda like the playboy mansion, everyone should experience it at least once in their life. n nI'm usually there on Saturdays during all the popular weekends so if you run into me don't be afraid to say hi. See you there! Cheers!",2
"I used to love this place, but they really cannot make pancakes. So much batter that the short stack pancakes are each over an inch thick and you can barely find a blueberry. Stick to the eggs and French toast here. Pancakes are not a good option.",1
"I stayed at Planet Hollywood on my first trip to Las Vegas. Being a Vegas virgin is overwhelming when you consider the options for your hotel stay alone. Planet Hollywood ended up being the perfect fit. n nCheck in was super easy and the bell people were very friendly. The rooms are huge, clean, and perfect for groups friends because the toilet is separate from the huge soaking tub and shower meaning many gals can get ready at once . Although there are some remnants of Aladdin carpet and lighting , the former hotel, it is very modern. To my pleasure, it is also not tacky! The prices were really affordable, and a good deal considering the room we got. n nThe crowd seemed generally younger at PH and the casino was much quieter than others on the strip. To me, this is a good thing! It means you can get a seat at any table you want and walk around without being clobbered by a ride on scooter or fanny pack. Like others, I enjoyed the trendy music and lack of a theme! n nThe restaurants and shops in the Miracle Mile are conveniently attached to the hotel. Not to mention, PH is right on the strip. At check in we got a bunch of coupons for the Spice Market buffet, which made eating there a pretty good deal. The major downfall for me was the pool area. Both pools are tiny and surrounded by a huge concrete desert. Great for tanning, not so great for cooling off!",2
"Bad Ass Cajun. nCame in on a Friday and sat at the bar to get some Cajun fare. I got the seafood gumbo and the half shrimp Po Boy. Both were delish! Shrimp in both dishes was plump, juicy and that special crunchy fresh you dream of at night. Sitting down at the bar, I talked to the tender and the guests. Everybody was friendly and the tender even was calling me by name when I left. I explained how much I liked the gumbo and she let me try the sausage and chicken gumbo on the house and it too was also a tasty classic gumbo delight. nAll in all this was a down home friendly, classically Cajun experience that is now one of my favorites.",2
"I was once a devotee of The Cupcakery. n nThat day is no more. n nI was finally able to try out Retro Bakery's cupcakes after a long time of wanting to, but never getting up the motivation to make the 25 minute drive from my apartment. We ordered a half dozen n n Red Carpet red velvet cake almond buttercream n Chocolate Fountain chocolate cake, chocolate buttercream, chocolate ganache n Milk Cookies chocolate chip cake, vanilla buttercream and a chocolate chip cookie n Shamrock Shake green vanilla cake and mint buttercream March special n Apple Cider cinnamon swirl cake and apple cider buttercream n Sprinkled Donut vanilla cake, fudge ganache and sprinkles this thing is God's gift to man n nEach cupcake was the right amount of moist the cake tastes homemade and not like it came off a production line. The flavors are not overpowering and blend together well even with the more unique recipes like the Apple Cider cupcake. The buttercream really is all they make it out to be not too thick, not too sweet and not too much of it. They also look pretty, but with that homemade touch. They look like a human being made them, not a machine like grocery store cupcakes. n nWe ate the cupcakes over the course of 3 days and they held up wonderfully. Even the cookie on the Milk Cookies cupcake stayed soft. My favorite was the Sprinkled Donut I still see it in my dreams, I swear. n nThe bakery itself was great as well. It smells fantastic inside, and two of our cupcakes Shamrock Shake and Red Carpet came from fresh trays that were brought out as we were deciding on cupcakes. Service was prompt and friendly they gave us plenty of time to make our choices with out rushing us. The price is much cheaper than similar bakeries 2.65 a cupcake or 29 a dozen. n nRetro is definitely worth the drive. They keep it simple, and focus on just making a fantastic product. I will be back to try more of their flavors.",2
"A group of us went, and from around the table, it seemed folks enjoyed their food but wasn't necessarily impressed. Pricey too. My chopped liver I know, am I like seventy? I try anything once reminded me of sweet cat food and the bagel chips were so hard I gave up for fear of my teeth. Sweet potato fries, ok that rocked. n ni was excited about the bakery section though. The counter guy was great, patient with me while I basically bought a sampling of everything. The choc babka was unmemorable and extremly crumb y what a mess cutting it , but add insult to injury, I go to Luci's Marketplace the next day and find the same babka there for 35 less than what I paid at Chompie's.",1
"Dr. Patel is amazing like everyone else has said. I got my yearly physical with blood panels done through him and I received my results in less than 24 hours via email! This has never happened to me with lab results, ever lol. He talks to you like he wants you as a patient and he asks about your health history instead of making you fill out the long questionnaire about it. I'm glad I found Dr. Patel though yelp and I will be coming back to him for my primary care. Thanks Dr. Patel!",2
"Excellent. Staff, food, service, quality, freshness delish. Excellent prices.",2
"Just came back and got the french toast with strawberries and bananas for breakfast, and I still love this place. Highly recommend.",2
"This was my first time to Del Frisco's. My Boss said he had been to one in Chicago but never in Vegas so we took out our customers for a great steak dinner. n nWhen you walk in its very fancy and since it's the Double Eagle ""golf term "" they give away golf picks which is cool if you like golf stuff. n nWe made a reservation via opentable for 8 people and it worked perfectly we were seated near that back there restaurant in a banquet room at this larger beautiful round table. Gorgeous place setting and decorations. n nOur waitress name was Carly I think I can't remember but I feel sorry for her because the group of guys we had at our table were crazy. We all were getting a little bit too rowdy for this type of place. It was funny but a little nuts. Luckily she was really cool and hooked us up with great advice and our orders came out super quick. So that's a plus. n nWe all started off with beer and wine and I had Jack on the rocks. Then we ordered Shrimp Remoulade and Crab Cakes. The shrimps were delicious because of that the wonderful heavenly sauce they had on them. The Crab cakes were also very good because of a lobster sauce that came with it. Then we ordered some Onion Rings Beer Battered, Thick Cut. These things were massive. It was the biggest onion rings I have ever seen eaten. I really liked the onions flavor they were perfect and the crust outside was perfect as well. n nThen we moved on too the main course except I can't remember what everyone ordered but I think my Boss ordered the Filet Mignon 12 oz. and 3 other guys ordered that as well. They said it was cooked perfectly and it was very tender and delicious. I always say let me be the judge. I know a good steak when i eat one. I love steak. n nSo I was looking over the menu and nothing wowed me. I asked our waitress if they had any off menu mega steaks and she said yes we have the Tomahawk Cut 32oz Rib eye long bone. I said hmm that sounds good. So i ordered it medium rare. It was 90.00 It came out pretty quick and I was feeling pretty hungry so i started to dig in. It was cooked just right which was nice. I like it bloody and still wiggling gross I know It was seared perfectly and tasted good but it really needed more spices. I don't know if they just salt and peppered the steak or if they put a rub on it but it was bland in my opinion. It really needed some garlic or rosemary,thyme, oregano, paprika or something. I finished the steak in 20 minutes and I was still hungry. nI was a little disappointed on the size of the steak seem smaller then 2lbs. n nThen for desert our customer recommend we all have a round of Limoncello which i have never had before and most likely never will again. In my opinion they are way to sweet. Almost choking sweetness. I mean if you like lemon flavor you would like this but it's not good to take as a shot all in one. n nOverall our customer said the dinner was great and my Boss really enjoyed the night so I would say we most likely would recommend and or come back next year for our Sema Dinner event. n nThanks Del Frisco's for the awesome memories!",2
"If you are looking for the best creamy latte in town, this is your place. Biscotti are also very good.",2
"Great food. loved the chicken curry. Although relatively low on spices to tone it down a little, it had all the flavors that I would get back in India. n nWas completely surprised with the belly dance. Was pretty neat and a nice show. n nOverall excellent food and really close to authentic. Would love to come back!",2
Wow! Happy hour from 4 10 pm.everyday? Who's heard of that. While the location is downtown and deserted on Sunday night when we went the bartender was great and very attentive. I live Guinness so for 4 pint you can't beat it. The appetizers are also very tasty and 1 2 off. We have been to the one in Hawaii which is old and only has happy hour from 4 7 so this is great. I would definitely go back.,2
"I was referred to Dr. Hart by my orthodontist. I had a bad experience elsewhere, and so I was looking for a new dentist. n nI absolutely love this place. The staff and Dr. Hart are some of the most friendly people I've ever met professionally here in Las Vegas. She is very reasonable with her pricing and the work is stellar. nEach time I've been in, I've been greeted with smiles. Even when I was having my tooth ground down for a crown I get very nauseous and dizzy from the sound and smells the assistant was very calming. She ever offered me a blanket because I seemed cold. nExcellent customer service very genuine. n nIf you're looking for a new dentist in the Northwest.",2
"I was not impressed with the restaurant or the staff. The atmosphere, service, and food quality really does not demand the price they are charging. Drinks are really overpriced as well. n nThe runner got confused with our orders and yelled at me for confusing the waiter and ""handing "" the plate to the correct person at our table. The Lamb was delicious. That was the most noteable portion of the evening.",1
Lost our reservation and snooty about seating us at 9 15 even though there were many open tables. Disappointing.,1
Never actually ate in there but we ordered some dishes once and they were disappointing. We ordered some shrimp chow mein and some beef dish and both dishes were filled with filler. The shrimp dish had those little shrimp that you usually find in fried rice and the rest of the dish was all basically frozen vegetables. Everything seemed like it came out of the cheapest bulk bag of product they could find at Costco. I don't know about the buffet but nothing I ate made me want to go back. The place has been open for at least 7 8 years by now so it must be doing something right. Maybe the buffet is rather cheap and has a good selection but the food I got from them was nothing I would want more of. The Chinese food in the Boulder and Sam's Town buffets down the street are much better than what I had here and I'm pretty sure there's better Chinese food in the surrounding area. There always seems to be families going here or parties of 5 or more so it probably priced cheap enough for a family to come in and look the other way when it comes to taste.,1
"The absolute worst management. The people are not happy, no one acts like they care if you shop there or not. They carry only the most basic items, as though it were a poorly run 7 11. I tell myself every time I go, that it will be my last trip. And then I forget since its so close to my home. But today they had there last chance at my money. I am done with them and Safeway. No stars. But I had to choose at least one",1
Nice place for taco Tuesday!,2
"Cool fromagerie on the way to the Jean Talon market. They have a huge selection of cheeses as well as some intersting jams, cookies and crackers. My friend and I picked up their excellent little tote bags. There was some misunderstanding about the price of these, but the owners resolved the issue in our favor and we only paid 1.39 for our cute little bags. The bags are great with holders included inside for wine bottles. I'll definitely be back.",2
"I contacted Todd's office regarding a speeding ticket I received in NC. I live out of state, travel a lot for my job, and typically work 65 70 hours per week. I really did not have the time or knowledge to deal with this on my own. I am so glad I contacted Todd's office. The fees were reasonable. The follow up he provided was wonderful. The matter was taken care of without much time needed on my part and with a result better than I expected. Prior to this I've never had to hire any attorney. I cannot imagine my first legal expertiece going any better than this did.",2
"We used a Groupon voucher for a two hour trail ride for two. When we arrived we had to sign a release and pay a few dollars for tax. I understood this was a trail ride, but was slower than expected and a bit too long for the pace. The guides were nice and helpful getting on off the horse and provided brief riding instruction. Don't forget to tip your guide. Very glad we went, it was a nice morning ride and enjoyed the experience.",2
"Wasn't the best. The food was pricey for the quality. The most annoying thing was that we wouldn't understand a word our server was saying. We constantly had to correct her because she was getting everything wrong. If they want to give their Chinese place an authentic feel, that is fine, but hire people who speak English. It made such an unpleasant lunch to have to do sign language and correct the server because of the language barrier. n nThe positive The food came out very quickly.",1
Closed Out Of Business.,1
I saw Far East Movement here. I'm a big fan of the go go dancer platforms. This is a complete sentence. 2 Bud Lights will go for 20 here. Drink before you come. This place is rather cozy. Come if you are on a list pass if you have to pay a cover.,2
"The main tower was much nicer this time around. Our joined 2 bedroom suite was very nice with a complete dining set, living room kitchen. It overlooked the main pool complex which we had time to visit several times. n nThere are two main pools, one adults only several I counted three hot tubs. There are a ton of padded lounge chairs three cheers for no waffle butt! , tables with chairs cabanas that you can rent. I didn't see anyone renting a cabana during my trip. There's also a bar at the adults pool but it closes relatively early. Both pools close at 10PM but there is a 24 hour pool by one of the other towers.",2
"Great Ferrari dealer, I bought a new California from Tony off the showroom and I cannot wait until the new 458 convertible arrives. If it was not for the Ferrari dealer I would rate it three at best, restaurants tend to be very overpriced there. Also drinks insanely overpriced.",2
"We used to frequent this place for breakfast quite often. My boyfriend and I went for a walk on the Southside Riverside Trail and were hungry for breakfast. We arrived and had a 5 minute wait. The restaurant is very small. The waitress was anything but friendly. We had to ask for drink refills and our ""thank you's "" were never returned with a ""you're welcome "". She reached across the table to grab dishes without saying a word. Our omelet and two eggs over easy took 40 minutes. I have always enjoyed the food here, but the long wait for my food and the terrible service really made for a bad experience. Don't think we will start frequenting this place again.",1
"Bought a set of Titleist golf clubs here about 6 months ago. They just didn't work for me so decided to sell them to a broker. Turns out the clubs were COUNTERFEIT. Attempted to bring them into the store to get a refund but was only offered store credit. Employee informed me that he is also losing on the deal since he has to know dispose of them. I don't see how that would be a customer's issue, but my protests didn't matter. I realize that they aren't a Titleist retailer, but it seems pretty unfair not to refund someone's money on counterfeit merchandise. If they can't identify authentic equipment, I'd be extra cautious about buying any golf equipment from them even with a store credit .",1
"Great food, perfect temperature beer!, what to eat and what to drink, its all good so far! Cant wait to go back!",2
I won't be back! n nThis clinic does not respect their patient's time. I had an appointment and they called the day prior to cancel on me. I rescheduled the appointment for the following week. It took OVER an hour to even see Dr. Jaz. I have waited 20 45 minutes in the past but over an hour!?!? Unacceptable!,1
"I was looking forward to eating here. Wow ordered a side of O rings and Jalapeno poppers received 5 O rings and 5 poppers 3.85 each , that feels pricey n Half slab of baby back , it was a little cold, nCold slaw was soggy over all spent 65.00 plus felt very let down n Only good thing the waiter was VERY Professional.",1
"Quick Review If it weren't for the stellar fish fry and the awesome beer selection, this place would be a solid 2.5 star establishment. Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many if not most of Madison's finest. n nDetailed Review nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot. The menu selection is vast we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye. n nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35 40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange. I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should not include half of an orange as garnish. n nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid very good, actually. So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem. Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. n nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup. I went with the vegetable garden soup others at the table went with chili and salad. The soup and salads arrived within seconds the soup was good not great, but good and it could've been a little warmer. I'm told the chili was good as well not life altering, but good. n nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp. He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish. n nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish. She apologized profusely. curds came out a few minutes later apparently they forgot about us. The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover. n nCurds were excellent not your typical ""from the bag "" curds, which was a nice surprise. They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese they were cooked perfectly. n nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait. The cod was phenomenal. Three huge pieces with a mound of fries now that's what we're talkin' about. The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful. The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored. I loved every single bite of it. n nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp both of which were excellent as well. Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry it's definitely a top 10 offering. n nIn the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under 40. We tipped well and called it a night. I'd definitely go back to Dexter's sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us. Thanks, Dexter's! n nDexter's WIN n nFood 4.5 stars excellent fish curds and fries were stellar nService 2 stars they forgot about us, but made up for it nValue 2 stars would've been over 85 for the 4 of us nMisc 3 stars the place isn't much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection. n nOh also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and or walk a bit to get there.",2
"Beautiful place but HORRENDOUS SERVICE! n nIssues n1. did not have our reservation n2. seated us in the worst place in the restaurant because they had other big reservations but managed to lose ours. n3. Super slow and bad service n4. Very, very limited menu n5. Expensive for quality of food meat was undercooked n6. Supposedly a tapas place?!? yeah. n7. Ordered a brazilian coffee, was told the machine was broken, coffee mysteriously appeared in a cup, was luke warm and cup half full. Gross.Was then charged 7 for that nasty coffee! n8. Was then told by the waiter that they had another reservation coming so we would have to give up our table. Unbelievable! n9. Waiter poorly attempted to remedy the situation by offering us a shot n10.Had to hunt down the waiter to get bill and then again later to pay it. n nThis place is only passable, if you already happen to be in the area and are only there for a drink or 2, besides that, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! n n The only good things I have to say about this place is that the decor is lovely and the DJ Eric Chorney was outstanding ",1
"Brought a business group of 10 here last week. We were seated at a window table and naturally the view was exceptional. Especially the lightening show from the thunderstorm. nThe bar maid and wait staff service was impressive. Acute to the smallest of details. Made the experience very enjoyable. nThe food we had the lobster bisque based on other reviews. Yes! Get it! The presentation to the taste was fantastic. nDinner was a mix of dishes ordered. Several steaks, lamb and seafood. n Lamb, was very tasty but over cooked to request. Asked for med rare and it was well done. I would have sent it back but it was still very tasty so I was OK with it. n Steaks, most had the NY Strip and I heard all highly positive comments. One ordered the rib eye and said it was just OK. Not bad but not great either. He felt it was the type of steak and wished he ordered the strip instead. n Seafood pasta dishes, both gave positive comments nI saw some Yelp comments on tepid temp food being served. Not us. Soups and meals all hot. n nSummary great atmosphere, epic Las Vegas views, really good food. Also I felt was another bonus was the restaurant is a quick and easy walk from the hotel's front doors. Having been to many LV hotel restaurants with clients, you can find yourself walking for 15 minutes through smelly, smokey casinos to get to the restaurant. This one was quick and easy.",2
"Late night, heading back to the hotel and decide to try Carls Jrs. I got my food and headed down the road taking bites here and there in the dark, and the burger had no flavor, like it lacked seasoning or something. Get to my room and pull the burger out to finish it and find I'm eating RAW MEAT! The burger was brown outside but RED inside. Fries were just ""alright "", so you can believe I won't go back again.",1
"The overall experience was great but I did leave my watch there and the manager Jamila or however it is spelled refused to send me my watch back free of charge and even asked me ""now why would we do that "" and I just thought that maybe since we spent the weekend at the MGM 3 rooms pool parties, the fight, the clubs that out of courtesy MGM would pay the 12 it would cost to send me my watch free of charge but no. Its all about money and I will be taking my business to Luxor from now on! Thanks Jamila",1
"I was in Las Vegas for a company function and had heard and read about the reviews for this place. I was eagerly anticipating my visit and even had spoken with my colleagues about going. We were staying at the Flamingo so the location was ideal for us to visit for breakfast. There were 12 of us that went in and when told it was a 40 minute wait 8 decided to go elsewhere. The remaining 4 decided we would wait you only get to Vegas so often right? We waited for 40 minutes and we were finally seated. Everything is okay so far. The menu looked fantastic and I had already made up my mind I was having the chicken and waffles. I could not wait! We ordered coffees and water and then our meals. The menu states clearly ""please be patient, everything is made from scratch and can take time to prepare "" I am more than okay with this. I am willing to wait for fabulous, fresh food. This is where things began to deteriorate rapidly. Our waitress while bubbly was inattentive or inefficient at her occupation or both. We asked for refills on coffee after waiting for 10 mins for her to notice we needed more. She said that she had some brewing. Okay, no problem. Two seconds later my wife notices other servers pouring coffee for their customers. After another 5 mins we wave her down again and ask for more coffee. She says ""sure! "" as if the previous request never happened. Several minutes later the coffee finally came. Water glasses were never refilled without having to track someone down and ask. Same with the coffee. This went on for 40 45 mins while waiting for food. The food finally started to come out. First was my wife's pancake. A couple of minutes later the french toast came out for one of us and then a few minutes later the BLT that was ordered sans the fries. Then a few minutes after that my chicken and waffles came out. Now as I stated I am cool with the 40 minute wait for fresh food but in that time frame you should be able to get an entire table of four all served at the same time. So, we all start to dig in. My wife's pancake is huge and looks great. They gave her a thimble full of syrup for a pancake that is the size of Texas. No problem just ask for more. We had to ask again after it never came. My dining companions were enjoying the french toast and the BLT. Still no fries. I was taking on the chicken and waffles. They did not come with any syrup. They did come with a ""maple reduction sauce "" unfortunately it was reduced to nothing. The waffles were good and had bacon in the middle but they were dry without the necessary syrup to get them down. Asked for syrup again. Waited. It finally came. My friend was done with the BLT. No fries.asked for them and they finally came out. Asked for more coffee and water. Waited. Finally got it. So as you can imagine our table discussion this entire time has been how disappointed we all have been with our experience. My friend Mark finally asked for the manager and voiced his concerns with our experience. The manager apologized and left. A few minutes later Mark caught him again and asked for his business card and said ""I'm a letter writer "". The manager gave him the card and then came back to the table and took his BLT and the drinks off of the bill. Smart move. Took a little prodding but it was a smart move. We could not wait to pay and get out. I would not make the effort to go back. My new name for this place is ""Hash House A No Go "" and I will leave it at that. Good day now!",1
"Apparently don't come here a Sunday afternoon. We have been here an hour and still haven't got our food. Food was old, dry and cold. Better food at a dive bar.",1
"I was there in October 2012 and it was fantastic. I was just there again in April and bragged to my friends about how great it was and we were all horribly disappointed. We got there later in the evening and stood in this very slow moving line. I could see a ton of empty tables but for some reason they were staggering in the people about every 5 minutes or so. By the time we got close to the cashier, he anounced it would be closing in 30 minutes. We debated but thought we could eat and be out in 30 minutes. We got in. Service was bad. The server not sure her name but long ponytail and hefty girl was very unfriendly. Food was dry and as it got closer to closing time they took our silverware when we went back for ""last call "". They were still sitting people up to 10 minutes before it was to close and we saw them and were like WTF, those poor people really got ripped off. Anyway I was sad it was not what it was in October. nI have been to Luxur, Excalibur and Paris Buffet too and Paris is the best I have had in LV. I have been there several times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and would highly recommend it. I will probably try others at other hotels before going back for din at TI. I was really embarrassed that I had bragged so much about it to the friends I had brought.",1
Racial Profiling at its finest.I've been there a couple of times because the clothes are nice. But every time I go in the staff stares at me and follows me around the store they are NOT friendly. n nI guess they have not seen the the movies Pretty Woman or Selena.they should and maybe they will learn a thing or two about ppl with money. .by the way I'm hispanic.,1
"It is too greasy, fatty, and certainly does not look very appealing. The cost is ridculous and don't mention the filthiness of the place. They hand washed the dishes. That was not sanitary. The health department should have scrutinized Kathy's more carefully. Glad to see them closed. n n If you want some great soul food, check out Jimmy's Market on W. Lake Mead Blvd. and Cheyenne. The catfish literally melts in your mouth and the cabbage is tender, seasoned well, and have a real southern taste.",1
"We tried Oyshi on a recommendation from a Renoite transplant that lives in Vegas now, we were expecting decent ayce sushi, much like the ones you can get in Reno.not even close. n nSushi nThe sushi is just, ok. The fish wasn't super fresh, some of the cuts of fish were thin and cut poorly, falling apart. Most of the rolls had the same notes of lots of imitation crab meat mixture, so they all tasted the same. n nAppetizers nI'm a fanatic for raw oysters, they had small Pacific oysters that were a bit on the warm side and very bland tasting, flavorless even with the siracha sauce they dotted on it. It tasted as though it was about to go bad and they rinsed it with tap water, even the shell the oyster was served in lacked oyster liquor, which isn't a good sign. Needless to say, I was only able to eat 1 of 4 that I ordered and it was a struggle to keep it down. I've eaten raw oysters from a jar and the raw oysters here came pretty close to that. I told the wait staff that the oysters were a bit off and she replied, ""that's odd they're usually not like that "". The manager was attentive and came to our table to see if we wanted more oysters, stating that there wasn't enough sauce on our previous order as to why they tasted that way. If the oysters are fresh, why would you need to drown it in ""sauce ""? n nThe sweet shrimp with side of fried heads, amaebi, were not so sweet, which means they weren't so fresh. The shrimp heads weren't prepared properly, not fried well and so it was tough to bite through it. n nAfter having the oyster and amaebi, we passed on the uni, because if you can't get the other 2 right, there's no way we were going to try the uni as it needs to be super fresh. n nThey were pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so maybe I just have high expectations for sushi, or maybe we just got the Sushi chef in training, but if your like me and your jonesing for some great sushi, this place isn't for you.",1

I am only 30 so I hope that it isn't the latter! By the way, in jest I told the owner, Cassie that if I could I would love to just sign over my paycheck to her, I meant it! She would only have to share it with a few other fave places like Changing Hands Bookstore,Trader Joe's,W.Foods Agritopia Joe' s BBQ , the local farmer's mkts. !

Mentioning of he cafe's glorious offerings! Seriously. I mean this.Sincerely superb! Everything on the menu is so very fresh and equally fresh tasting! I would be hard pressed to think that anything you could ever order from Pomegranate to be any less than perfect enjoyable! n nMy very first visit, on their soft opening day I had a severe cold and the nice young lady staff made me an herbal tea called ""Vitali Tea. "" After that very 1st visit I was truthfully dumbfounded and struck down by the very feeling of unadulterated love embodied by a physical place! I counted the days until I could make the time to visit again! My 2nd visit was actually just yesterday. I hadn't eaten anything in the morning, it was way past lunch and I was extremely hungry! I was also very tired from a company mting which was in freaking Peoria! grrr! as I passed by Phoenix's demure skyline i'm from NWI Chicagoland area my tummy mind wandered through the ""Roosevelt Row "" area of metroPHX. However, I was drawn closer closer to home in Ahwatukee, not just by the promise of sleep but also by the overwhelming desire to visit Pomegranate once again. I stepped in the Cafe' with a big appetite and little desire to spend a great deal of .Pay day, bills and such.pending.a horrible concoction.So I decided on the quiche of the day which came w a phenomenally fresh house salad. I then splurged and opted for some energy in the form of a cup of fresh squeezed juice drink called ""Laughter. "" I broke out my net book, sat down to eat.And my mouth was over taken by the fresh flavor of each individual item that I ordered as I ate it. Complete taste bud loveliness.and overload at the same time! I kid you not! I even had tea dessert! I sat for at least over an hour, eating slowly enjoying eat bite. Computer screen blank. I just read the drink menu instead .also i forgot my log on password btw lol! .yet.I was still amazed as I throughly read through each drink description. The drink offerings menu are the size of a ""normal sized "" 8x12 food menu. The mind blowing variations of teas, fresh squeezed juices even elixirs on both front and back. And that's just the drinks! The food is amazing! ""Love "" awaits you too! nGottah go! Sincerely, S.",2
This place is totally awesome. We have eaten here for many years and food absolutely rocks. True Italian without the guilt. Flavors without adding fat and grease factors. Drive is totally worth it. Can't say enough good things about this family owned business. Go ahead and order dessert. Live a little. Will make the drive from Gilbert to Fountain Hills after we move.,2
"I had Dollheads come to my friends room to do her hair for her wedding and I got mine done for her wedding. Chrissy was amazing and both of us had the best hair. This is a great company.

I will be using this service everytime I am in Vegas. n nI liked Dollheads so much that I had them come to my hotel 2 days later and I ended up doing the hair and makeup package with Karlie, Again it was a great experience and this is something I will budget everytime I am in Vegas. n nThank you Dollheads for making me feel like a million dollars.",2
Service was great. This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest. My favorites were the tripe and the chicken feet. Would definitely come here again.,2
"We are from Tucson, and found this breakfast gem on Yelp! Each of enjoyed the friendly service, hip and clean atmosphere, and the yummy food. The food came out quickly, and was very tasty. The steak and eggs were a great deal, my huevos rancheros was organized and tasty, and my wife loved her veggie scramble. We especially liked the coffee spice bar in the middle of the room they have Cholula! . The only thing that could be added to it is a cinnamon shaker. Great place! We will be back!",2
"Paco's Tacos, like most Mexican restaurants, brings you out a big bowl of chips and salsa to start with. This is great, but unfortunately the salsa tastes like marinara sauce spiked with hot sauce. We tried the No Name Margarita and another one which I forget the name, but it was fruity with some orange flavor. We honestly did not like either flavors but they were definitely strong. n nThe homemade guacamole is pretty good and we ordered quesedillas which were good as well, but the food came out much too quickly. If we wanted fast food we would have gone to taco bell! We were hardly able to enjoy the chips and drinks before they brought our meals out. n nOverall I really don't recommend, there are much better Mexican places out there!",1
"Pure and utter dog poop. n nAsked for an ""Anaheim Scramble "" with some orange juice. The cashier told me they didn't have juice. I asked if they were out. She replied no, and that she even thought it was weird they didn't carry any juice being a breakfast place. n nMy scramble comes out and the waitress who brings it to me looks at it oddly before serving it to me. I ask her why she looked at it that way. she said no reason. I insisted there would be some reason to eye my eggs like that. She showed me the eggs were under cooked and runny and returned it to the kitchen. n nWhat she brought back was some sort of Frankenstein's monster of a scramble with stale toast. See picture for further reference.",1
"The food here is typical mexican food and good, but nothing I would rave about. Nothing to complain about either. I really come here for the great location and unique building. My daughter loves sitting by the fish tank and I always seem to find a new place to get a great picture of her every time I visit. There really are quite a few very good spots for taking pictures. Service is good and this place reminds me of what Mexican places were like when I was a kid which is not a bad thing I'm looking forward to sitting at the little bar or in the open air lounge and having a margarita one day when I make the trip kid free.",2
"This place has a subpar menu, its just not very appealing to try some of the more adventurous stuff. I stuck to the tried and true teriyaki chicken. It really isn't very amazing here, its ok. If you're near the theatre, want to grab a quick bite before the show, and you are really craving some asian food, you could give it a try. Otherwise I'd just go elsewhere. n nStaff is not very friendly at this place, I imagine its family run, but they seem like they could care less if you could eat here. I really don't like places like this that think they'll stay in business just because they got an awesome location. Aside from the person who takes your order, doesn't smile, and doesn't really say a word there is no service to rate here. The food isn't terrible, it just isn't amazing.",1
just read the other reviews ,2
Space is off the lobby with views of the pool and the Strip great atmosphere. Vibe was sports oriented with lots of flat screens broadcasting the Wisconsin v Arizona NCAA game. n nBurger was good but the service Erin from South Dakota was not. It took 40 minutes to get our burgers and the Rings arrived at table cold and in edible. They comp'd our coconut shrimp app and the rings which was appreciated. But would have preferred to have gotten our food timely and hot. The establishment was not particularly busy so it was hard to imagine what the problem was.judging from other yelp reviews this place has service issues.,1
"My wife and I had been travelling on summer vacation and felt this was our best dining experience during our week of eating out. Our waiter was excellent. He made recommendations and checked up on us, but never in an over bearing manner. We ended up ordering their Black Gold Pizza, which was made up of potatoes, golden beets, garlic and olive oil. It was a very unique combination, but we both thought it was the best thing we had eaten on our entire trip. We will try to duplicate this at home, but probably won't come close to what we had at Proper Brick Oven.",2
"Mostly everybody in Phoenix loves this place. I thought it was very meh. Being born and raised in the Midwest whispers and black I know what is and what is not good fried chicken. This is decent at best. n nSo if you have never experienced really good fried chicken before then I can understand why you would love this place. n nPrices are pretty good and the portions are big, service gets the thumbs up. n nWorth a try just to say you've ate here before.",1
"Great food but lousy service I just spent 35 on bakery there this morning didn't receive a thank you from anyone! Remarkably, the person who helped me and filled my order is one of the owners! This lack of service happened to me at Manna before and I decided to give them the benefit of a doubt and try it again. Clearly, they don't appreciate my business so I'll take it elsewhere",1
"I am VERY picky about my cake and cupcakes. I have been to Sprinkles, Let Them Eat Cake, Cake Cafe, Scratch, Honeymoon Sweets, Robert's Catering. basically all the cake places in Phoenix, and this one is my favorite thus far. nMany places decorate cakes well not that difficult to do , but the cake itself tastes boring. You might be shocked by this, but many cake places in town used box mixes. The baker at La Dolce Pesca creates each cake from scratch. n nI called and asked the owner PJ to make me a cake to take to my friend's baby shower. The only requirement I had was that it tastes great and is decorated well. She made an white cake with strawberries and Bavarian cream filling which was fantastic! The cake was decorated with a Superman theme and was the biggest hit at the party. n nWhat I appreciate the most about this local bakery is that the owner came in on a Sunday so I could pick the cake up right before the baby shower. Great cake and great customer service!",2
"I had to laugh at everyone's review of the 'tude seeping from the little emo hipster nimrods that work here. My friends and I contemplate whether we ""feel like dealing with that place "" simply because of the little jerks that work there! I would never consider selling anything here, the prices are way too low for what you would get in return. But as a shopper there are a few freakin' awesome finds that you can get at Name Brand Exchange n n 4 army surplus style caps in khaki green black that have a velcro back. so cheap and awesome n n belly button rings, you have to look beyond the blinged out handcuffs and cherries.but there are some good ones n n cheap shoes most shoes are around under 10. Most of my favorite flats come from this joint. n n rubber plugs for yo hipster gaged ears, they have quite the selection n n 3 rack outside, sometimes ridiculously good, sometimes ridiculously bad! n nJust go into this place knowing that you may not get attentive customer service, but you could get a killer of a deal!",2
Funny that the people who work there are the onlys 1s to like this place. They need a 0 star on here some places dont deserve a star. Been in Vegas 9 months had 6 different Barbers most do a good job. I just moved to the neighborhood and thought I would try this place. Nice inside everything newer. Sit down and hear nothing but bitching about how they need to bring in business from some girl dressed as a guy. Every other word was a curse word and she was cutting some guys hair. Which she went on a rant about her employees and never touched the guys hair for almost 5 minutes. My guy a heavy set guy don't know his name. I get a fohawk which should be a easy cut for him since I got a haircut 3 weeks ago. He trims the backs and sides and doesn't touch the top. Tell him to trim the top when he says he finished. This is the 1st time I been to Barber and they don't razor you. Looked ok when I left because he put a bunch of product in. That I didn't ask for. Ask him I owed him tells me 25. The most I paid so far in Vegas 16 way over priced. That a Fohawk is a designer cut. You our a Barber all your haircuts should be designer cuts. So far after I get a haircut I don't even have to comb my hair for 2 3 weeks. It automatically goes in to a Fohawk. Now I can't even comb my hair. Now I have to gel it down for the 1st time in 9 months have to wait for my hair to grow so another Barber can fix his 25 fuck up. Wouldn't recommend this place for my dog or my worst enemy. Go to Village Barber up the Street that's where I will go back to they did a great job and 16 is what they charge.,1
"My girlfriend and I support this restaurant every weekend. She loves the burgers. I tried one of the stuffed burgers once and wasn't particularly impressed. Nothing wrong with it just an average burger. The pizza, however, is fantastic. Excellent flavor with ingredients you can't choose from at other places. Just finishing up one of them now, and will absolutely be going back for one next weekend.",2
"Message to Mgnmt, I've been to this location several times. I'm starting to see a decline in overall cleanliness and service is starting to take a real hit. Seems like new people read turnover. They don't even act as professional as they have in the past. And the food, fry's seem not as fresh and few on first order. n nI'll try the other local West next, if it's the same way I'm guessing the bird has flown the coop.",1
"I despise this airport. n nI've breezed through check in and security before, but enough times it's been the utter nightmare from hell so it forces you to arrive 2 hours early for a flight. n nRenting a car here is ridiculous. It's the absolute longest ride on a shuttle to the ""rental car center "" that I've ever seen. I'm not joking. Add another 15 20 minutes to that 2 hour lead time, folks. And there are no gas stations around it, probably because if there were it would get robbed daily. n nThe fallout shelter design the place is a concrete bunker, after all while hardening the facility in the case of a direct nuclear strike, also prevents cell phone reception. Don't count on being able to call people and say ""i'm here, come get me. "" when you are in baggage claim. n nPhoenix has special place in US aviation. Yes, it may be one of the only major hub airports that will shut down because it's too damn hot to fly. Be warned. n nOn the plus side, the concessions are fairly decent if somewhat forgettable , and it's pretty easy to get a non stop flight to from here from most places in the country. Free wi fi, but that's starting to become the norm rather than the exception. n nMeh.",1
DO NOT EVER GO HERE! Especially do not use Laura! Had to have redo my hair twice! And I still got charged for her screw up the day before my college graduation!,1
"I came here for Restaurant Week during lunch today, and I really glad I got the chance to try them out. n nThe space is beautifully redesigned and has the classic yet modern feel of a luxury steakhouse. The host and our waitress Genevieve were friendly in a professional way. Our waitress was particularly good about recognizing when we were ready for interaction or when we wanted a little more time to chat and enjoy our meal. n nMy dining partner and I ordered different things off their restaurant week menu so we could try a variety of their items. Between us we had the oyster shooter, the salmon tacos, the top sirloin, the gnocchi, the profiteroles, and the creme brulee. n nThe salmon tacos were delicious, but a bit oily for my taste. nThe oyster shooter was refreshingly smooth. nI requested the top sirloin medium rare, and it was a bit under for me and closer to rare. The gnocchi was delicious. I don't normally like gnocchi, but these were soft and pillowy but not doughy. nThe creme brulee was decadent. I made sure to scoop up every last bit.",2
"Stopped in to get a new tube after Tera popped hers on our last critical mass ride. n nGuys in the shop are hella cool. Very friendly, willing to talk to you, answer questions, show you how to do stuff etc. n nI only bought a couple of tubes and a tool set on this visit, but I'm sure I'll be back for other biking gear. n nI also bought my bro a mountain bike here a couple years ago and that experience was also stellar. No complaints for this place.",2
"We had heard great reviews about this place, so we were excited to try it. We even took advice from people that love this place on the appetizer so as to be sure to sample something that had been vouched for. n nThe wait to get in was fairly long. This location was quite small, so that was part of the problem, but it also seemed popular. n nThe service was great. We were provided with suggestions on a completely unfamiliar menu all requests were promptly addressed. That is were the 2 stars come from. n nThe food was below average at best. The bread oil was some of the worst I've had. The bread was bland, flat, burnt. In fact, the burnt pieces had the most flavor, albeit a charcoal flavor. We had the fried ravioli appetizers. Frozen food much? Yah, they tasted looked like they came right out of the freezer. If they weren't, then somebody is really screwing these up in the kitchen. Finally, we shared a meatball sandwich. I mean really, that is tough to mess up, right? The bread was odd some kind of flat bread instead of a hoagie bun. That bread was also burnt the sandwich was dry. We had to request a side of sauce. n nThe couple we were with raved about a turkey sandwich they ordered, but a turkey sandwich with deli meat requires no cooking, so no wonder that was the best thing at the table. I seriously doubt we'll ever go back. We'd go to Brio or Carrabbas first. Hell, I'd do Olive Garden before this place.",1
"I will say, that in the last few weeks I eat there a lot. Brueggers has stepped up their game. All of my orders have been exactly how I ordered them yes, I said it and even when there's a long line, the wait is minimal. Thanks Brueggers, for making your service as good as your food. finally! ",2
"This place had a nice and clean atmosphere, but the food sucked. My wife had the Guinness beef stew and she hated it. I had the trio salad. The seafood salad was minced to almost liquid and the chicken salad was made with canned chicken. The lettuce was going old. The amount they are charging, the meals should be more quality. If I returned it would be for a beer, but nothing else.",1
"I had beef fajitas so original of me and my wife went with a crab dish something new on the menu . Food was great as always. The atmosphere was good and full of great energy. When we checked in we were told we would be seated in 10 mins. We left our names and hopped on 2 bar stools to scarf some hand made Guac while we waited. My first question to the bartender was ""will the hostess find us here "" this based on the fact hay they don't have the little light up vibrating ""it's your turn to sit toys . He said absolutely. After realizing way more than 10 mins had passed I went up to the stand and asked ""are we up? "" The hostess said ""you are next. "" I said ""so you skipped us. "" She then reluctantly admitted yes we called you and you didn't come. That is about the only negative to our night at cantina. Great place to get some Mexican food!",2
"Awful. Only getting 2 stars cause its cheap. Should've known better. Better cheaper buffets at home at the Indian casinos and that's saying something. n nCrab legs are cooked in SALTY Salty water and just sit in it and absorb all that salt and get mushy. Salty mushy crabs legs so gross. n nPrime rib was upwards of medium well, cut your loss and switch it out, ugh. n nVirtually everything just felt like it had been sitting in the window way too long. n nFinally I went for the creme brulee, pretty hard to mess that up. n nAnd they did. n nIt had no caramelized sugar on top and sat in a cold case. n nI thought to my self n ""Oh how neat they caramelize the sugar in front of you and make it all fresh! "" n nNo, they don't. There is no caramelized sugar to CRACK on your freakin creme brullee, they told me ""well there is caramel on the bottom "" n nIt's not flaun, it's creme brulee damnit. n nNot to mention it was totally instant mix from a box. nSo nasty. n nThis place SUCKS. Way better buffets on the strip for a much better value, sure it's 27 bucks, but the food quality is about par with fast food that sit in a window forever. n nAnd yes I still left the waiter 20 cause the only thing I can say good about this place is at least the service was good. n nDon't waste your time or money.",1
"After waiting in line at the deli for 13 minutes, I was finally placing my order. As I was doing so, another deli worker stood between me an the person taking my order. Once he moved, I finished my order. The person who took it went behind the counter where a fat cow who knew her cut everyone in line and asked if she could take her order 'real quick'. The deli worker took her order and made the cow some food. While she was serving the cow, she had forgotten all of my order. When she asked me what I wanted for a side again. I asked here what number the cow was you take numbers at aj's deli to keep thinks 'more organized'. The deli worker responded ""it doesn't matter, i'm making yours now "". .well bitch, it does matter. Fuck this AJ's and their lack of customer service.",1
We were here for dinner few days ago. The service was outstanding and their Japanese Fusion dishes was delicious! Def will be back. Try the crispy rice spicy tuna and lobster miso soup!,2
Since I was staying here I decided to put the baby hubby to bed and see a movie. Went and saw a 3D one called Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Ga'hoole. It was showing in the XD theater so it was 15 bucks to see it.no biggie since I had a coupon for free popcorn! I went and got a huge icee as well. The seats in the theater were super cushy and rocked. I was literally the only person there so I picked the best spot and hunkered down. Great movie for effects but it was soooo cold. I was glad I brought a jacket but wish I had brought socks. nSo after it was over it was midnight and I went to the bathrooms.they were HORRIBLE! I give them 0 stars. So after my traumatic bathroom experience I walk out and see Resident Evil 3D just started and looked around and saw no one and walked my ass in and sat down and saw another movie.for free.,2
"The only thing I liked about this club were the decorations. As for the dance floor, or lack thereof, there is absolutely no where to dance. Expect to be packed like sardines and have drinks spilled on you. If they could somehow make the dance floor bigger I'd come back but in the mean time.no thank you!",1
This is a good Mexican place.,2

"We just ate breakfast here, and it was great. It is Phoenix, and it is outdoor dining, so bear that in mind. I ordered the Monte Cristo French Toast and holy crap was it good! haha Seriously, it was really, really good. The coffee was good, and the fresh orange juice was even better. My wife had a omelette special of the day, and it was decent according to her . n nThe most frustrating part of the meal were the flies, and to be honest, I'm not sure what all steps you can take to get rid of them outside. It didn't make the food any less tasty, and some odd part of me felt like all that waving around might have helped burn off some of those calories. n nThe server was very nice, and was honest about things she had tried or had not tried. For example, they had a new ""Brisket Hash "" on the breakfast menu, but since the menu had come out the day before, she hadn't really gotten to try it yet. Good place. I'll definitely be back. And if it weren't for those flies, I would have given it a 5 star rating.",2
"Okay so I was put off on coming here because I hadn't heard the best reviews. I finally gave in and came to try it out. nIt was actually quite good! The pho broth was super hearty and rich and delicious. n nThat was the FIRST time I came here a few weeks ago. n nWe came back yesterday and based on yesterdays experience I don't think I want to come back here. nThe pho broth was NOT rich, hearty OR super delicious. I don't know what happened! nI also need to remember that the Spring Rolls here are NOT the business. Too much lettuce and not enough noodles! nThe Egg Rolls WERE good though, but the Shrimp Rolls were NOT. n nNext time Imma go back to my regular spot, Pho Annie!",1
"Oh Nationwide. I called today because I had a unique situation that needed fixing. I had used Nationwide previously, and today they lost a long time customer. When I opened my last pair of contacts, i discovered that one of the containers was empty. No contact, no solution. It had been over a year since my last appointment, and they couldn't give me a trial pair of contacts until I had an eye appointment with the doctor. I understand this, I'm fine with this. I would have loved if someone would have gotten to the point instead of running me in circles. What should have been an easy fix turned into being placed on hold 8 different times in one conversation, being told to call a different location to try and seek help 3 times, and no one knowing what to do. You know what would have fixed this situation? Setting up an eye appointment for me, and providing a free pair of contacts. This conversation took 45 minutes. I called two locations multiple times. I was disconnected twice, and somehow reached the voicemail 3 times while attempting to get back in touch with the person I was talking to. Neither location had any idea what to do and they only answer I got from ANYONE was to call a different location to get help. No one wanted to take responsibility or give suggestions on how to resolve the issue. I flat out said ""I don't know what I should do "" and I was told to keep calling locations until someone figured out what to do. So somehow after repeating myself to 5 people for almost an hour, I talked to someone who seemed to know what to do. I updated my information with her, confirmed an appointment time with her. Finally we are going to get somewhere. NOPE. Hours later I got a call because they don't take my insurance. What the hell, people? What is wrong with you guys? Get your shit together. So back to square one I go. I am extremely frustrated. So once I find a new optometrist, I am still expecting Nationwide to replace the pair of contacts.",1
"WOW! Is all I have to say. I have not even got onto my flight yet and I am extremely angry as I write this. n nI booked a flight from LAS VEGAS to LA to visit my girlfriend.

I called SPIRIT which had the most difficult time finding a customer service phone number to ask them why I am paying more money than what is stated. The lady advised me that if I confirmed my flight 24 hours or less prior to my flight starting, that I had to pay an additional fee for my bag. n nHOW IS THIS COMPANY STILL IN BUSINESS.? n nI should have paid 150 with SOUTHWEST who I know I can trust. I have been reading all these reviews and I am so scared to even get onto my flight.

"Tequila Bar, I came here after reading reviews on yelp. I was looking for a cheap bar with decent drinks. When I saw they had a 128oz Blue Fishbowl for 20 I YELPed! But was disappointed to hear they had no n ""fishbowls "" and would service it in two large cups. The two cups turned out to be 64oz Plastic pitchers, which was pretty fun. What wasn't fun was that 1. It has no ""fishies "" in it like the picture and 2. It was 90 Soda. Boo! But hey, for the novelty the price wasn't bad! n nThe Nacho's at the next table did look pretty delectable, but I just came from a big dinner so I just ordered the ""southwestern corn on the cob "". I was curious. What made it southwestern? I should have known when I ordered it and the waiter said, corn you want the corn? ok. And Corn is exactly what I got. Just boiled corn with a square of butter. for 3 FAIL",1
Ok. Went there last night. We don't have a lot of choices way out here in the West Valley. The service and food were great. Tables were clean. Curry chicken and shrimp fried rice were both excellent.

"Located on the Rancho side, in the Smith's shopping center the other SMA building is located on the Charleston side so if you drive there, there is not a passageway between the two buildings, and you will have to exit and then make a left turn onto Rancho yup, I speak from experience , this building has been around since the 1990's was a patient off and on, over the years . n nI chose this office because it's close to my house and the freeway entrance is closeby, so it's not an out of the way commute to work. But, because Rancho is so darn busy, you will need to allow for extra time, so that you make your appointment on time. If you are very late, your appointment will be bumped and you will need to reschedule saw this happen yesterday at my appointment . Also, I think that there is a charge for no shows, BTW. This is a busy street, a busy parking lot for SMA, and all around busy strip mall shopping center, so expect delays when entering and exiting. n nRecently, my insurance coverage has been with the same company, Sierra Health, so I've been coming here for the last two years for the OB GYN department located on the 2nd floor , as well as the mammography department this is the one you get sent to, if there are ""questions "" on your regular mammogram located on the 1st floor . If the results are normal, you will get a letter in the mail. If there are issues questions, you will get a phone call. n nThe office building is clean and there are bathrooms located on the bottom floors. However, one day, when I was getting a mammogram, there was a terrible odor throughout, and the employees were saying that they had to endure working the whole day with that stench.

"I stopped at Gus's for lunch today. I always like to try new places close to the office. So, I walked in and sat down at the bar. The stools are too short which makes the bar way too high.

My food arrived about 5 minutes later at which time I asked for some Ketchup. The sub was cold yet the cheese on it was melted. Cant explain that. The fries were almost too hot to eat yet I managed. Overall, the food had very little flavor. I finished eating and received my bill promptly. n nI was somewhat shocked at an 11.11 bill for a sub w fries and a drink. Wait a minute, I was SHOCKED. I mean really, come on. There are literally dozens of pizza places to eat lunch and these guys are charging that much. n nI guess I would think about returning to eat here if I could afford it. Instead I think I will go to Barros and eat for less than half the price. n nBAM!",1

We went on the Rim Runner and the rollercoaster. The hotel has been remodeled a little bit, but still has some touches that should be done here and there. The buffet was gross and the food was dry and hard to eat.",1
Fun little restaurant. Parking can be a challenge but it's worth it. The spring rolls are excellent. The presentation is really nice and the sauces that are served with them are also excellent. We also enjoyed the Shaking Beef. They have a decent wine list and have a well stocked bar. We've always had good service at this restaurant and have been to it several times!,2

Someone needs to clone the chef this is what a ""medium "" pink burger should look like. I haven't had burger cooked that perfectly in years. The onion rings are better than most, the Quesadilla with all the side ingredients was very cool and the potato wings were huge and perfect.

Stayed from 3 19 2014 3 23 2014 nThis hotel doesn't even rate a star in fact it should get negative stars. My bathtub hadn't been cleaned in my room and was full of hair and soap scum. I moved rooms and in that one the garbage hadn't been emptied and the sink in the kitchen spewed water all over due to a leak. My friends' room had toilet issues and the tank leaked twice all over the floor. When we checked in everyone was complaining that the hot water wasn't working and the maintenance guy worked all night to get it back. It's very expensive for what you get which is a hotel that is so run down that everything is broken you can't be sure your room is clean and people complained of noise when some revelers came in at 2 30 in the morning. I would be better off sleeping in the car. At least it was cheaper!,1

Happy hour is still pretty decent prices, and the food hasn't been bad, it just isn't as good as it used to be, unfortunate really.",1
"I think the trick to getting non chunky taro bubble tea here is to request it as a smoothie which, not surprisingly, means upping the price. n nIf you're in Oakland and in the mood for some greasy noodles sometimes I actually am , Lulu's can be all right. The menu is pretty clear on which dishes can be made vegetarian, which I appreciated. I don't really expect authenticity with a Pan Asian place, so I'd go with dishes that are less ""traditional, "" like the chow fun or the pan fried noodles. Big portions, pretty fast. n nDon't think I need to mention the service here other people have covered that. It'd be nice, though, if when you ordered the taro bubble tea non smoothie , that they'd warn you that the drink came with taro bits. I've never had a taro bubble tea anywhere else that wasn't smooth other than the boba . But I guess I shouldn't expect that, given the general quality of service here.",1
"The customer service is excellent. The food is excellent for the price, at 5 a person you are essentially paying fast food prices, but you get a bit more here.

"The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because I could have slapped the hostess. Once again, I was put in the back with the loudest birthday party group possible because why? You guessed it, I had a baby. This irritates me beyond belief! From now on, I'm going to be a jerk about it. n nAnyway, to the important stuff. Despite the issue to the group next to us, the service and food were excellent! Melanie was our server and she did an outstanding job! My glass was never empty, I never had to ask for more drink, she kept the table clear of empty dishes, paid attention to details in our order, and always had a smile on her face. Why can't there be more servers like her? n nThe overall aesthetics of the place were very nice. It had Doric and ionic pillars for decorations, Italian themed paintings on the wall, and the lighting was just right. Not too bright, not too dim. n nMy husband and I started off with the calamari. Even though it could have used a little bit more flavor, it was still very good. The horse radish sauce and marinara sauce were excellent choices to go along with the appetizer. Alongside the appetizer, a small loaf of precut bread I think it had a little bit of rosemary in it and this dipping sauce that was out of this world. I'm not a tomato fan, but this was great! It was an olive oil base dip that had sun dried tomatoes, oregano, thyme, black pepper, and a few other things in it. I couldn't stop eating it! n nCaesar salad came next, I love it when restaurants put your salad on a chilled plate. The salad was very good and not too much as well. They had homemade croutons in the salad that tasted like they had parmesan cheese in it along with other flavors. They also didn't just give you a plate with a few leaves and all stalks. That was very nice. n nFor our main course, I had the Chicken Scallopini. It was 2 chicken breast fillets lightly saut u00e9ed in olive oil topped with feta cheese, portobello mushroom, another kind of cheese, and a lemon, caper butter sauce. It was served with linguini on the side. Minus the too many capers, it was fantastic! I thought my chicken would be dry, but it was very juicy and full of flavor. My husband got the Frutta di Mare. This thing was loaded with mussels and clams on the half shell. From what I saw, the seafood was on top of a bed of fettuccini and marinara sauce. He could not stop raving about it, so I am going to guess he liked his meal. n nFor dessert, I got cr u00e8me brulee and my husband got the chocolate chip bread pudding. FINALLY a restaurant that had cr u00e8me brulee that isn't a 5 star restaurant. Nobody serves it anymore. Of course, I loved every minute of it, and so did my daughter. I think she ended up eating half of it! My husband was in love with his bread pudding. I'd never had a bread pudding with chocolate chips in it. It was quite tasty.",2
"Okay so let me start by saying that usually I go to polished nail salon which is right down the street from diamond. I came in to get my nails changed and I chose to go to diamond because they were open later than polished usually is. I made an appointment for 8 45 PM and there was a five dollar charge because it was considered after hours. When I first called to schedule this appointment I had asked the receptionist to please put me with someone who is good at doing gel because usually I go to polished and polished stands by their work and does a really good job. Plus I get nervous going to someone I don't know. The receptionist laughed at me and said ""oh we are better than polished "" now knowing that this had been said I should've trusted my better judgment and not gone because first of all talking bad about another salon is in bad taste and unprofessional and second of all, polished is one of the most successful nail salons in the vegas area. So I went to get my nails done and I wanted to get hombre white with just a little glitter. The lady who was doing my nails was a very nice lady but she didn't seem to know what she was doing. when she started doing my nails she would dab the white onto them and then take a brush and started brushing it out in a weird way. It looked so streaked and uneven and it didn't look like hombre at all. I told her to put a nude color first then the white to create the blended hombre affect and also so my actual nail wasn't showing and she said no and ignored my request. She continued doing what she was doing and when she was finished it honestly excuse my language looked like shit. I told her it was streaked and didn't look like hombre and she said "" well that's how I know how to do it "" It was so bad to the point where I had asked her to please redo it. she gave up and had the owner do it. When I asked the owner to use a sponge she pulled out a cheap sponge that left my nails blotchy and uneven and all in all I was completely unhappy with the way they turned out.they looked so hideous I took off a day of work to have my nail lady at polished fix them. I highly recommend going to polished just down the street. They charge a little more but the quality you get is well worth the price which is not something I can say for diamond nails. For someone who talked trash on another shop. They sure couldn't back it up.",1
"The first two times I saw Alejandro's at McCarran Airport, I was in a hurry to catch my flight. I did notice a line for this place both times, and the aroma was good. Later in CA, I check Yelp for reviews and they were not stellar for a place that always seemed packed. Finally, I got enough time to try their food and I have to agree with the lower grade tone of the reviews. It's not as good as it smelled or looked. I was never served chips and salsa during my whole visit. The fajitas was salty like it was cooked in sea water. It's sad to say that places like Chili's, Friday's or Applebee's got better fajitas than this place when every from the waitress's and the cooks were immigrant Hispanic. Only three lousy tortillas came with the order and the steak was tough on the molars. To make matters worse there was a hair in the salsa. The whole experience made me wander why this place even had a line of customers the first two times I seen this place because the food was disappointing. I guess being one of the first restaurants as you entered the airport help create the allure, furthered along by having their open grill aroma seep into the airport walkways. Not many airport establishments can boast of having an open grill that lets their aroma go into the walkways. Generally, mall foodcourt quality comes to mind when considering airport eateries. Skip this place, don't let the aroma or lines of gringo's fool you. Try the Jose Cuervo Taquilera instead. They got more refreshing food than this place. I am deducting another star for having a hair in my salsa, not being served any chips.",1
"the brisket is very dry, lacks flavor. the pulled pork lacks flavor. both meats were over cooked around the edges to the point of black. this place microwaves everything, even the roll which i had to remind them that my lunch combo came with . the baked beans came right out of a can tastes like the store brand not even bushes. the food was very salty. you can't put salt on meat and call that seasoned. i will not return. i can microwave better food at home than this.",1
"I went to Cantina Laredo one evening after work with a large group there were nine of us and had a really good experience! n nThe food Not super authentic Mexican by any means but they offer an edited menu that's executed well in other words, small menu but everything on there is pretty good . The complimentary chips and salsa were replenished frequently I probably ate like three bowls of chips they were FREE! . I'm a vegan so I ordered the Tacos de Hongos mushroom tacos . The balsamic glaze was tasty, there was no cheese on my plate and it was a good portion size. n nThe service They were BUSY and thanks to a co worker having a reservation, we scored a large table in the back. The section we were in had sliding doors so it was obvious they gave us the space they typically use for private dining events. I don't remember her name but our waitress was good accomodated our requests and offered suggestions. She recommended the mango margarita and it was AWESOME. n nOverall, I'm looking forward to coming back for Happy Hour so I can munch on some chips and have a few more mango margaritas!",2

"Horrible. Menus covered with fingerprints, dirty silverware,bad food and miserable staff. The waitress was unfriendly, said there was no cheese in the potatoes, yet they were crawling in it, and half cooked to boot. A bite of bacon was worse than a mouthful of salt, and the waffle was about as bland as it gets. I really tried to find a redeeming factor, all I found was the butter was fresh. At the end, the waitress asked if I was done with my 1 4 eaten meal, and when I said I was, she said ""Good! "". I definitely will not come back.",1

I actually like it more than Cheesecake Factory though because the menu items are more to my taste and a little more creative and fun in my opinion.",2
"This would be a 4 star if it weren't for an incident involving my daughter being scratched in the face by another child in the playroom.

"Tough call with the 4 or 5 star rating. Let me explain. n nI would give this Sardella's a five star rating due to my most recent experience. Every year my family goes to this Sardella's to celebrate my wife's and my birthday with our immediate family parents, brothers, sisters. and there is usually enough room somewhere to fit a party of around 10 12. They are very accomodating. This recent trip we were enjoying our pizza and wings when one of the employees brings us an order of their cinna bread which apparently they made in error so they simply gave it to us on the house. We were very gracious as we were just finishing up the pizza and wings and had not ordered a dessert. One bite of this cinna bread said it all. It was over the top, doughy, sugar laden, cinnamon sprinkled, crisscrossed icing heaven. The entire family was overwhelmed with its taste in a good way. Let's just say I recommend it. n nI give the four star because I simply can't give 5 for one experience but if there were a 4.5, I would solidly put it there. The pizza is always good and the wings NEVER disappoint. The people who work there are great and I have never had a bad experience with the service. Ingredients are fresh as pizza joints go and I have been told by my family that the salads are fresh and tasty. I have no clue because who eats salad at a pizza place like this?! Great food and family times. n nWhere is that 4.5 star rating?!",2
"it's too much. i get that they're trying to be a place where a variety of people with different tastes can all get together, but. the variety has gone too far. i don't WANT a place where i can get coffee, breakfast, lunch, snack, beer, wine, study tables and live entertainment. i want a place that does one to a few things WELL instead of doing a bunch of things mediocre. n nit IS a great place to meet with people much more room to chat than most starbucks or other chains and you can spend a few bucks on a beverage instead of going to a restaurant and feeling like you need to scurry away when you're done eating. But i don't even want to spend the money on the sub par beverages. n nwhich brings me to the other ""too much "". the prices are way too high. it's at least as expensive as starbucks if not more for some things and i still haven't found anything that i thought was delicious. the safest thing to do is to order an iced tea i've never felt like sending it back, but the coffee is too weak and tastes a little. off. and the small is still 16oz too much. n ni want to fall in love with this place and i've given it several goes, but i just can't.",1

"The wife and I dined here for dinner on 8 9 11. Ordered Fried Pickles 4 and Pork Buns 6 for appetizers, the Graze Burger 19! and the Burger of the week 15 , fries with both entrees. n nThis was our first visit to Graze. We had pretty high expectations, seeing as how it is the 'sister restaurant' of L'Etoile. It certainly was the hoity est place we've been to, and with their focus on gourmet, local ingredients, we were sure we were in for a great meal. n nFirst impressions No reservations needed cool! They were very busy, which for a Tuesday night was surprising, but it was election night, and there was a rally going on. The wait to get seated was about 30 minutes, not bad, but they told us 10. Noisy very noisy. near impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The decor seemed like they were trying for an artsy modern look, but all I could think about was how the metal chairs were the exact same kind of metal chairs you always see in interrogation rooms on cop tv shows. Next time you are watching Law and Order, or one of the others, check out the chairs. You'll see what I mean. n nService was slow, maybe we were just impatient because we were very hungry we were in a little bit of a hurry, we wanted to check out the rally. After what was probably 30 minutes, we were finally served our appetizers. The fried pickles were a huge disappointment. There was more breading than pickle. I honestly didn't realize you could slice a pickle that thin! Greasy, very greasy. They tasted like something you would get off a food truck at a carnival. I didn't use the sauce, the wife did and said it was good, so maybe that was the trick. In my opinion food is either good or it's not, and you shouldn't have to drench it in sauce for it to be good. The pork buns were nothing like I was expecting, which could just be my own ignorance. I was expecting pork buns like I remembered from China One Buffet on Broadway back in the day. What we got looked more like a pork taco, but whatever. They tasted ok I guess, not something I would normally order, and I probably wouldn't order again. The wife said they were 'different' which is usually code for 'not very good'. At this point, we were feeling a little leary about our entrees. n nAfter what felt like forever but was probably about 30 more minutes , our burgers fries came. Not sure why it took so long for two burgers and two orders of fries. My burger was the Graze burger fresh ground sirloin, ribeye short ribs, caramelized onions, cabernet jus, sesamse seed brioche The burger did not come with any toppings. Just burger, bun caramelized onions. It looked a little naked, I thought. Now I didn't expect the chef to want to bury his work of beef art under a blanket of cheese even though we are in the dairy state , but a little lettuce, tomato, pickle or even some raw onions really would have elevated this burger to something special. Without all of that it was just ok. The taste texture reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. Which would have been fine if I'd ordered the meatloaf sandwich, but I didn't. I ordered the 19 hamburger. 19! I guess I figured that I since ordered one of the most expensive things on the menu, that it would blow my mind, but it just didn't. My mistake. In fact, I found it a little salty, and not in a good way. n nThe wife, being more adventurous than I am, ordered the burger of the week, which we didn't hear the name of and barely heard the description of. Something about a burger with bacon, limburger cheese, and hash browns, served on a play on french toast. She said it was 'weird, wet and kinda gross' It also was extremely messy, the 'french toast' or whatever it was pretty much disintigrated, leaving her hands a sloppy, greasy mess. n nI know right now you are probably thinking 'sheesh, don't you have anything nice to say?' Yes. I do the french fries were very good. So there you have it. 46.42 after tax for some darn good fries. n nNot what you'd call a good value. Although, after this experience, neither of us is in a hurry to try the 'sister restaurant' L'Etoile, which would have a significantly higher price tag, so in a way, dining at Graze actually saved us money in the long run. n nAn expensive lesson learned.",1
"In previous reviews I have mentioned my predisposition to buffet restaurants, given my gargantuan appetite. Well here it is playing a part again. So many buffets are greasy, salty, cheapest meat, bland options. This can turn off even me. Indian restaurant Red Fort isn't like this. n nThe food at Red Fort isn't maybe connoisseur curry but it's still pretty good and not the cheap quality I was expecting. Needless to say this makes their lunch time buffet an even more attractive option. For students this will only cost you u00a36, otherwise u00a36.85 or u00a33.50 for children under ten. One of the strengths of Indian restaurants for me is there usually better than average vegetarian selection. Indeed Red Fort's buffet offers a very good vegetarian selection. n nThe only draw back I can see from Red Fort might be that it can get a bit busy, at least during term time or festival weekends. For some reason it attracts quite large groups. So you might want to avoid these busiest times.",2

"We went here the other day to try some place new, after looking on yelp app I saw Oliva it had good reviews, and said it was good for kids, so we went. It was not good, I expected better food for the price, it really was not a place for kids at all! n nThe food was so bland I had the Mediterranean shrimp, it was not what i thought it'd be I could have made this 10x better at home for pennies on the dollar 13.99 , it was some rubbery shrimp sauteed onions, peppers, and tomatoes in some tomato juice, with a little garlic powder. The rice that came with it was dry and pretty tasteless they said it was seasoned with jasmine but I couldn't taste it! n nWe had brought our kids 2 3 because the reviews said good for kids, they seemed very annoyed that they were there but they where accommodating. Other patrons seem upset we were there with kids also. the kids were being well behaved occasionally knocking a fork on the table or getting a little loud giggling but that was it no screaming or crying n n All in all , I won't be back!",1
Ambiance coool ! Excellent pour un repas rapide et app u00e9tissant ! Tout est d u00e9licieux ! Vraiment bien!,2
The dinner started poorly as the hostesses could not find my reservation. The experience was improved somewhat by the Hot Rocks small plate which included thinly sliced sirloin placed upon a heated rock to cook the meat. Unfortunately the restaurant only provided a minimal amount of meat with the hot rock and as a growing Monkey a few slices clearly was not enough. The 9 oz Petite Filet was uninspired at best. If you are looking for steaks in Las Vegas then do not come here. Mr Massie and the Light Group will need to improve this restaurant or they will continue their slide.,1
The only reason I would rate this a one is because there's not a zero our waiter was horrible service was lousy we were given the wrong bill the deal was tougher than shoe leather not that I've ever eaten shoe leather but I think I just tried it I would not recommend this to anyone visiting or living in Las Vegas,1
They have balut. n nThe other food we had was pretty good too.,2
"Absolutely disgusted with this restaurant. I was looking up restaurants that had received good reviews in the area found this one to try. I've never had Vietnamese food so I was really excited. We walked in and were promptly seated. It was really busy which we took as a really good sign. There were some big groups that had come in but the service was still on par the waitress took our order it wasn't very long before we got it. n nI had ordered the Lat Na my lunch companion ordered the House Pho'nomenal. The Lat Na was just some chicken, shrimp, noodles in a sweet sauce . Nothing flavorful. And I had ordered it at a 2 on a 1 5 scale it came out pretty spicy. The chicken had a weird taste smell the shrimp wasn't much better . It had the texture of frozen shrimp that had been overcooked. I tried a bite of the Pho couldn't have much more than that but my companion enjoyed it. n nThe awful part was that the table was really sticky and there were soup spoons in a holder which I had to pick through 3 of them to find a clean one to use. Also, there were some patrons at a table just next to us who asked to move b c there were ants all over their table. When we got to the front to pay our bill, we also saw some ants on the counter there were 2 people who worked there standing right by them who made no effort to clean it up! Additionally, our to go box was leaking . Perhaps the ants had bitten through it. n nWe are definitely not going back!",1
"Service was okay the first time. the other food is okay. but when I come here, I ALWAYS order the Sliced Beef Rolls. n nI've been back here a number of times since with my friends and we like to order the beef rolls and the xiao long bao.

When I get the cravings for beef rolls, I head here. n nIf you want to pay with a credit card, there's a 20 minimum charge. Too high. ",2

"Officially the worst airline ever! Never fly Spirit air!

"Byblos is a run of the mill Mediterranean restaurant in desperate need of a facelift! With a hit and miss menu and tall asking prices, it's obvious that Byblos still has much to learn after nearly 28 years in business! n nThe restaurant itself is well dated and the atmosphere inside generally feels like a retirement home lobby with booths for seating.booths that are very worn and borderline uncomfortable. While the decor could use a serious smack with the pretty stick, the smaller size of the restaurant does make it fairly cozy for family dinners and small gatherings. n nThe older lady and gentleman that run the place are pleasant and good natured, but can be difficult to understand. Obviously, this has caused several of the negative reviews, but their heavy accents do add something to the experience beyond just the obvious confusion. One thing worth noting is that they are their own waitstaff and they clearly don't move as quickly as they used to, so service can be a bit slow if there are more than 3 or 4 tables to tend to. n nOn the plus side, it's easy to get prime seating on both Friday and Saturday night, because it's rarely a full house! It's also one of the few places left in the area where you can enjoy free, live Belly Dancing during dinner on the weekends, so I give them props for supporting local talent! n nRegarding the food, I will say that the lamb dishes are tasty, the complimentary mint tea is exceptionally relaxing and the soups have a genuine down home taste to them. However, most of the main entree items are no more than food truck quality pitas and state fair combo plates sold at a premium price. The quality of the main ingredients just isn't there and a quick trip to the frozen food aisle at Costco would net you most of the supplies needed to start your very own ""Byblos "" franchise at home! n nThe desserts are tasty, but few are traditional and none of them, except maybe the baklava, appear to be made by the restaurant. Also, the bar is limited and the wine selection is nothing short of dreary, though that doesn't stop them from asking fine dining prices on grocery store brands of alcohol. n nWhile there's no real ""value "" in the Byblos experience, it's certainly a solid choice when you're just too tired on a Friday evening to drive somewhere else or the inlaws you hate happen to be in town and you absolutely ""must "" take them out!",1
"Visited this place with a friend. i used a entertainment coupon for buy one menu item with two drinks and get 1 menu item free. I got the Guacamole Burger with fries. 9.99. The burger tasted much better than the Carl's Jr. Guacamole burger. n n The female servers looked good in their 50's style dresses. very hot looking. n n Fast service and good food. Try this restaurant, you will enjoy the food and the view of the female servers. lol",2
"Der Weihnachtsmarkt 2011 war der schlechteste. 2010 war es zu voll, diesmal war die Sache zwar deutlich entspannter, aber fast nur Fressst u00e4nde! Nahezu keine klassischen Weihnachtsmarktst u00e4nde mit einem weihnachtlichen Angebot! Das Konzept ist mir schleierhaft. Auch das neue Plakat war eher schlecht der Sternlesmarkt der Vergangenheit war als Motto zwar auch nicht gl u00fccklich, hatte aber deutlich mehr Charme. Und warum man den Neuen Markt nicht aufgibt und stattdessen das Ambiente der Marktstrasse und des Kirchenplatzes mehr nutzt, erschliesst sich mir nicht. Nur der Gl u00fchwein vom Ettli und von den Ratsstuben war wie immer gut!",1
"Ok, I've loved this hotel for a long time and been here many times, but I finally booked a room! We stayed in a very large room with a HUGE bathroom! The room had two tvs if that tells you how big it was a balcony which was nice in the evenings. n The service was good as well. We ate in the hotel three times China Poblano, Jaleos, and Wicked Spoon all of which were great! The decor is FABULOUS! LOVE the attention to detail! Lots of colors and textures throughout. very visually stimulating.",2
"Maybe it was because I was famished.or maybe it's that good. Either way, this place is great option for a burger if you're in the area. n nVENUE As to be expected with most popular restaurants, the place was packed. It's got a sports bar vibe to it. Expect a lot of people, expect noise, and expect Sports Center to be on woot woot . n nFOOD DRINK I ordered the ELK GONE WILD, Medium rare. The meat is lean but flavorful. The rub gives it a great amount of flavor and the veggies and sauce don't overpower it. Even though it's a sizable piece of meat, you don't feel like you're stuffing yourself since the meat is less fatty than a regular cow beef burger. n nCARAMEL PRETZEL MILKSHAKE. Just do it. There are bits of pretzel in it and it's not too sweet. I can't even. SO GOOD. n nSERVICE Our server was pretty nice and attentive or as much as he could be given the amount of tables he was serving. We came around 2 PM on a Saturday. Not sure if it was because of the Holiday MLK but it was PACKED. Expect some sort of wait unless you're magic and get there at a time when there's less people. We waited 30 45minutes and they give you a notification via text so you can walk around the area. I recommend walking two minutes to the Barnes Noble down the way. The time goes by much faster when you're reading and being an intellectual of sorts.or at least pretending to do so.",2

"My husband and I along with our children, flew in from another country to spend our last week with our oldest son who will be leaving for boot camp with the US marines shortly. We rented a van only my husband was registered to drive and drove over an hour to the salt river recreation park on July 17 2014 at 12 50 pm. The plan was that he would drop off my 11 yr old daughter, 17 yr old son along with myself and pick us up at 7 pm. Upon arrival we were informed that because my husband and six yr old brought us and stepped foot on their property we would not be allowed to tube. We stated that my daughter and husband were only dropping us off as we rented the van that only he could drive, but the senior staff rudely informed us that this was their policy and they were not going to change it. They were completely heartless, rude and offered no apology for the fact that their website had no mention of this policy. We will never know what fun we could have had but were very disappointed with the staffs response. At no place on their web site does it state that tubers will be denied if they are dropped off or have someone under 8 yrs old in their car on their property. Yes we knew she could not tube and had no plans of even having her stay. The staff were completely unworkable and even admitted that this is not stated anywhere on their web site. As bad as this is I would have appreciated them saying, "" We are sorry you drove all this way but come back tomorrow and ask for me and I will give you a deal as this was not your fault. "" This would have been true customer service even in a hard situation.",1
"I absolutely love this gym, since the new management took over this gym has become so much better. Trainers are ALL Awesome, they help you on the proper technique. The change has been very good.

"This is your typical senior RV park in Mesa, AZ. There are tons of them out here 75 park models and the rest RV's. These folks keep the place looking good clean bathrooms, laundry room, grounds, pool area, etc. It is a huge park with 2 pools kept very warm one is a lap pool and is a bit cooler. The 2 jacuzzis are very hot like 105, but I'd rather them be too hot than not hot enough! There is a nice billiards room, sewing room, wood working, leather making, lapidary, card room they have it all and then some. Live music plays many afternoons with dancing this year they added a tiki bar that is open from 1 7, 6 days a week. They also have concerts and special dinners. The list goes on, but their tennis courts are many lit, they have a great softball field with bleachers, shuffle board, pickle ball, you name it.they got it. n nI was a little freaked when we first drove through the place like, I just don't think I can do this! But I LOVE IT! Granted I couldn't get in the place without my 60 yr old hubby but, the internet is good, we have a lovely spot and nice neighbors. Everyone is friendly enough and we even extended our 2 month stay another week. We have made rezzies for next winter, although not completely sure we will be here, it's only 50 to cancel, which is better than not being able to get in here at all the place is so busy we know peeps that couldn't get in!",2
"My sister asked me to have dinner with her after spending all day in the ER with my grandmother. Starving and puzzled where to gorge myself and eat my feelings. Remembering my sister lived by this great sushi place with a reverse Happy Hour, we decided to meet at Yummy Grill Sushi. n nImmediately entering, I was greeted with ""Moshi, moshi "" by all of the staff and sat down with my sister. Immediately a server came over, greeted us, took our drink orders, and handed us menus. We ordered the garlic edamame the MOST delicious stuff, ever. I ordered a second round. I wanted to lick the extra sauce left over in it. I also had a bowl of their Miso Soup, excellent as well. n nLet's get to the sushi. Since it was happy hour 4 PM 6 PM Sunday through Thursday 10 PM 1 AM everyday , rolls are priced as low as 2. All happy hour sushi contains 4 pieces and they aren't extra small pieces either. Our drinks arrived with a free portion of their veggie pancake. It had a nice, delicate flavor. We ordered the spicy tuna roll and avocado on top twice if you've never tried this, do, it's heaven and they didn't charge me extra how RARE is that . The shrimp tempura crunch roll was divine, we ordered that twice as well. My sister got an eel roll, which she loved I love eel sauce, just can't handle the texture. I tried it, it tasted amazing, but let her finish it . We order a Philly roll, which was yummy, you can't go wrong with creme cheese, salmon, and avocado. I especially like that it was fresh salmon. Some sushi places use salmon that has that smokey taste to it and it just ruins it for me. The garlic albacore came with the garlic sauce on the side the sauce was so good I wanted to spoon the rest of little bowl of it like soup. The Japanese Lasagna was also AMAZING! Warm and perfect. My sister and I had about 7 8 rolls, 2 orders of that garlic edamane, and miso soup, total damage 41 and change and we were stuffed to the gills! Our server was very attentive and answered all of my silly questions and trust me, I have a lot of them . n nThis particular night they had a lot of fresh seafood options, the board read O'Toro, Blu fin Tuna from Spain, Nodokuro, Sayori, Live Uni, Scallos, Octopus Legs, Abalone, and Lobster. They have a variety of non sushi dishes from a variety of Asian cultures. The place is small, but has a family like feel. n nThis may be the best sushi I've ever had in Vegas and that's a huge statement because I am super, duper picky. Well done, Yummy Grill. Can't wait to go back!",2
"Shame on you, La Canasta. Your 38th Indian School location let me down this morning after years of faithfulness. I have loved your machaca and egg burritos for many years and this morning, the machaca was dry leftover from yesterday? , the tortilla was old, not a green onion to be found, and the cheese was non existent. Maybe Sylvia's on 7th Avenue will re consider opening early on weekdays.",1
"We had our ""last supper "" in Montreal at Club Chasse et Peche. Wow! I was hoping my flight would not leave so we would have an excuse to go back. The atmosphere is relaxed and sexy, very sexy. The restaurant is down some steps in a cellar. The menu was complex and diverse. I had the Hamachi ""tartare "" and the lamb with chevre and my DH had the frito mixto and the cod special. Everything was delicious and gorgeously presented. Top quality ingredients were used. We saw the chaud et costaud meals come to the table next to us and they were ginormous! n nService was friendly and polite and professional and helpful. I asked lots of questions I couldn't decide! and they were really great at giving an overview of the different dishes. We spent about 2.5 hours eating and drinking and left happy and satisfied. Highly recommended!",2
"Finally a ""fast food "" place that doesn't serve meals full of trans fatt, sodium and sugar! I call those the 3 devils. I had the French Quarter and loved it!

The service was very friendly, and place was very clean. I will go back!",2
"DEE LISH FOR BREAKFAST FOOD! n nHave never been here or even heard of this place in the 20 years I've lived here . but leave it to my brother in law to come in from the East Coast and find online the absolute best diner for simple American breakfast food ever! n nAgain, we came in for Sunday morning breakfast the place was jumping always a good sign at 9 00 am. We were seated within 8 minutes and a server came right over and delivered some great coffee. They provide you with creamer both flavored and plain. My brother in law and I both had 2 eggs over easy, hash browns fresh made potatoes not frozen premade nonsense and put on a grill and sourdough toast. Perfect and soooo good. My husband had pancakes with the browns again fabulous! n nIt was easy to find and plenty of parking. The dining room was clean and the staff was great. They had flat screens with the tennis tournament on one and football on the other all easy for everyone to see. n nI saw they had sandwiches, salads and probably dinners but we didn't have any of that . but for breakfast food, guess where these East Coasters will always go for diner food like back in the day growing up in New York? n nThat's right, Nick's Diner II, LLC!",2
"Does it make sense to anyone that we have to pay more to park in Oakland than in Brooklyn? Thank you, PPA. I live in Bloomfield and work in Oakland and when the parking meters were changed and rates skyrocketed, I refused out of sheer stubbornness to ever drive into work again so I don't give PPA the satisfaction of giving them over 20 a day to park there. Seriously, if they are that much in need of money, Pittsburgh needs to reallocate its funds before the city has an uprising on its hands. nFurther, when I lived in Shadyside, I was appalled at how strict the situation was with the parking decals. My one decal expired and within the next day I had a beautiful ticket on my windshield. Aren't there bigger fish to fry than to Narc on residents who stay parked in a neighborhood for over an hour?",1
"Horrible service, the place is beautiful. But my order was wrong and the service was unbelievably horrible!",1
"Blah. 300 beers on tap and nothing impressive! I guess I'm a snob but if you ask for a large selection of beers how about have something rare I mean its Vegas right? n nI said give me something barrel aged or rare or a sour and they had absolutely nothing for me. n nI was shown a short list of rare and seasonal stuff which included a few from the Bruery which were the only beers that peaked my interest when the bartender told me these are rare bottles with limited runs I had to chuckle since I just saw them at Wholefoods every time over the last 6 months. n nI get why they don't have much more of a selection since all I saw being ordered there while I was there was Bud Lite and mixed drinks, but have something for us beer geeks please.",1
been there 2 times. it is way overpriced and the service is average. capital grille is much better. mortons is better. not a big fan.,1
"It seems we got taken in by similar things as other yelpers. The idea sounded really good and the menu is very inventive. While the salt air margarita was tasty, the twenty vegetable fried rice was average, and for average way over priced. I don't know which food network chef thought this was the best thing he ever ate, but that chef should get out more. n nNoodle dish was weak ocean's nest but the pork buns were tastey. And at the end all was extremely over priced.",1
"WORST PLACE EVER! Used to be my favorite restaurant when on King St. New location has made this place go way down hill. Every time we have been here the staff was rude and the service was terrible from the host to bar staff to waitstaff. I get a feeling like they feel they can do anything. Even though they have the best scallops ever, I will never go there again. HORRIBLE",1
"Do you enjoy gyros? I do. I have enjoyed them since I was a boy in the Chicago suburbs. After eating my first gyro from Mad Pita Express, I told my fiance that it was the best that I had ever tasted! The meat is tender, and delicious. The cucumber sauce, tomatos, and herbs are fresh and good. The Pita is puffy and soft. n nMy second time to Mad Pita Express I brought my fiance and she ordered a very good lemon rice soup. Very lemony and tasty! She also enjoyed a piece of fresh baklava which she said was special. n n5.00 for the Gyro is a very good price. The soup is 2.99 for a good sized portion. n nIt takes a few minutes wait for the food to be prepared. However, the quaint, cozy restaurant has interesting decor that my fiance and I enjoyed looking at for several minutes family pictures, many different plants, and eclectic artwork. n nThis is a small, casual, counter service restaurant. You can dine in or carry out. We chose to dine in, and our food was brought to us, along with plastic ware and napkins.",2
"Our server Tiffany, was great. She took care of us and deserves 4 stars. n nI had the stout. It was pretty good, BUT it wasn't cold. We were sitting at the bar so I know the pour wasn't sitting and waiting to be delivered. I hate warm beer, yuk. n nI ordered the pull pork sandwich. It was ok, not much flavor I had to salt it. nFrench fries fried in duck grease was very yum. n nThe atmosphere was a bit dull for me. I'd say the whole place was set to target an older crowd 50 60 year olds. n n I wont be going back to this bar. But if you are in the neighborhood check it out, just don't go out of your way.",1
"I avoid flying US Airways at all costs. I have had a sub par experience every time i have flown. The employees are never very helpful for friendly, they always load the plane too quickly and back everyone up way into the jet way. They always run out of bin space and force you check your carry ons and the plans are always fairly dirty out of shape. This past trip, we were stuck on the plane for an additional 30 minutes after the plane landed part of this was without power in the Vegas heat . The staff told us that they were having trouble lining up the jetway with the plane. I have NEVER not had a problem when flying US Airs! Fly Southwest. .at least they are friendly!",1

He even returned the following day to ensure that everything was fine.",2
"This was my second visit to this location. We came for lunch about 30 minutes after they opened. I had another coupon for 2 free buffets for spinning the wheel on Web Pass. n nThe food was less dried out. The broccoli in the Broccoli Beef was over cooked, but the beef was tender. There were no potstickers today, only egg rolls and clam strips which I did not try. n nThe salad bar was larger, but they took away the sushi section. I tried the pepperoni pizza again. It was okay. n nI did not see anyone at the carving station or the pasta station. n nThe chewy peanut butter cookies and coconut cream pie were good as usual. I ate them first. I would come back just for the desserts.",1
"Ordered a few sandwiches to go and most are pretty bad. The knish was dried and crumbly. The corned beef sandwiches are tough and hard to chew very stringy . You will definitely need to knife your way through. And even my turkacado sandwich was messed up ordered whole wheat and saw it marked as such, but resulting sandwich is on white bread . I think you can find better without much effort. n nQuick update got a message back from management the next day. I'm impressed that they spend time reading reviews and contacting customers. They agreed that the corned beef shouldn't be this stringy, so maybe we just had a bad experience. I will give them another try just on the premise that management is actively addressing concerns. Adding 1 star back for that effort.",1
Cheap entry fees and 5 lap dances are amazing. Chill place to hang out. Been with my girlfriend and she loves it and has always had a great time.,2
"Vf Factory Outlet is my favorite store in the whole world. Perfectly happy wandering around all day. So much to choose from and plenty bargains to be found. Eateries galore if you get tired and 10 discount for visitors. Other reviews comment on window displays! Who cares about that? Enough inside to see instead of bothering about with window shopping! Would be impossible to put the best in a few windows! Just get in, wander and enjoy!",2
Love the scene and the food! All of us really enjoyed the pastries! Highly recommend giving this place a try! The peppered steak had good flavor and the sauce was bold but tasteful!,2
The chicken and biscuits were awesome! The sauce on them was perfect. We loved eating here!,2
"It took about two hours to finish my car. When I got it back the interior smelled really bad and my car did not smell bad before I brought it in. Then they did not clean a lot of areas. I had to go home and get wipes and start cleaning my own car after I had just paid to get it cleaned. Makes no sense. There were places where I saw dust and had to wipe that down too. Also, they were suppose to shampoo and remove stains from the seats and they didn't do that at all. I had very minor stains on my seat from something that had dripped for a few seconds and I had to get wipes and scrub it off myself and the stains came off pretty fast, which means that they did not try at all to clean my seats. n nFurthermore, as I see someone wrote that they left items in their car and it ended up missing in other reviews here on Yelp.To ad to that, as I walked into the office of this place a girl was claiming that her ipad was missing from her car and they claimed that they didn't know anything about it. As I sat waiting for my car, the girl had called the police and two cop cars showed up and took her statement, along with the statement of someone that worked there. They searched the entire place trying to find her ipad. I don't know if they found it. I don't think they did. So it seems like this place has a reputation for ""misplacing "" people's items especially if they are valuable. n nI would definitely not go back there again. I recommend people to go somewhere else and save yourself the disappointment and potential risk of getting your items stolen.",1
This used to be my go to spot. But today it was terrible. The rice in the loco moco was definitely old and taste rotten. I couldn't even eat it. Had to spit it out. The wonton min soup was disappointing. The wonton wrapper was old and pasty. It disintegrated in my mouth. That's not supposed to happen.,1
"Cheap as far as buffets on the strip go, but not very good and I could have easily gotten a better meal for the same price that was not all you can eat. The mashed potatoes were a little watery, and the selection was pretty limited. Plus, there were children crawling everywhere and it made you feel like you were in the kiddie section of Disneyland. I was also kind of sad that I couldn't order alcohol throughout my meal. n nI must say though, I got pretty excited when I found the kids food section after the first disappointing plate. I'm always happy eating pizza, because for some reason ""bad "" pizza tends to be decent. n nTwo thumbs up on the frozen yogurt machine, that's one thing I'll never grow out of.",1
"Compared to other Get Go's, I think this one is pretty lame. First off, the parking situation is horrendous! Even getting into a spot can sometimes be a clusterfluke. As stated in previous reviews, the place is very small but they have a free air pump",1
"There seems to be a curse on whichever establishment opens up in this old house, but Melt is a parlor that needs to stay. I have my booze, coffee, and food options already taken care of on this road, so an ice cream shoppe is refreshing! n nTried the watermelon and cucumber sorbets. None of that fake crap like high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavor.it was all so fresh, you'd think they farmed the fruit that day. The price is reasonable, the quality outstanding, and you get to snack on a fortune cookie at the end. I have no regrets.",2
"The service was fantastic but as far as the food goes, Nothing was cooked right the lamb chops tasted burnt. The steak was cooked perfect but not warm and the best thing that we had ordered was the sides and they were merely okay.",1
"When in Las Vegas a stripclub. Visit is always in order for me and my girl!

"Dive bar? It absolutely is, and one of the best dive bars in Charlotte. How can you not love this bar? Stiff mixed drinks and tall boy cans of beer, this is the type of place you walk in, start talking to strangers and then you start buying each other shots. The place is filled with old, retro, honky tonk memorabilia, including Billy Dee Williams Colt45 signs. It is a blast from the past. If you live in Charlotte then you have to come to this place at least once.",2
"Daniel and I must've gone to The Flipside Cafe on the exact same rainy Sunday since it looks like we got the exact same crummy service. I, too, was so excited to see a fun, new place opening in Fort Mill, and the fella and I went with his parents for Sunday breakfast at 10 00 a.m., right when they opened. Luckily, we beat the rush, but that didn't make service any better. n nWhen we walked in and said we had 4 people, they had to figure out whether to seat us at a 6 top or put two 2 tops together. There was only one other group of 4 in the restaurant, and I thought it was odd that their seating was so limited. They sat us at a 6 top in the back, and after some seat adjusting, we were perusing the menu. n nOur waitress took the drink orders for only 3 of us, and the 4th had to shout after her that he'd like some water. It took far too long to get our coffee, and then it was only half full. Among the four of us, we had orders for two waffles, one pancake and one Eggs Benedict after literally 30 minutes, some of our food finally came. They said they burnt one of the waffles and had to redo it, which I appreciate, but I just couldn't figure out what took so long when hardly anyone else was in the restaurant. n nThe menu was creative, and the food was delicious, which is where the two stars are coming from. Our waitress hardly ever came to check on us and never refilled our coffee without us having to track her down it's in carafes on the counter, so we should've just refilled it ourselves . When one of us asked for ""hot coffee "" since what we were getting was lukewarm, our waitress had a bit of an attitude and said, ""Well, it was hot when I poured it. "" Nice. n nI'll give The Flipside Cafe one more chance and hope this crummy service was because they haven't been open that long, but my hopes aren't high. Bummer.",1
"Chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate! I was anxious to get through my dinner, so I could order dessert. Do NOT go here if you are planning on skipping dessert. I had a thin crust pizza for dinner, which was fine, not amazing, but good enough. My husband had a chicken sandwich, which he said was good. Our son had chicken and waffle fries. He seemed to enjoy the ""painting "" with the ketchup and mustard. I tried his waffle fries. Again, they were fine, but I couldn't taste much of the cocoa. n nAnd then.dessert! We had the sample platter with fondue, a chocolate eggroll, chocolate pebbles, chocolate barks, a banana waffle, and chocolate to drizzle over it. The fondue was amazing.especially the marshmallows. n nWe will definitely come back for the fondue and other delicious tempting desserts.",2
"I never got to even eat here. but i am reviewing their service. n nyeah this place may be swanky, but their service is unimaginably rude. n nmy party had a reservation for 9 30 pm. we got there at 9 20 pm and they made us wait until 9 50 10 00. yes i understand a big party is hard to seat. yes i understand that people don't want to leave. but a reservation is a reservation. if you arent going to stay true to it, then don't take our credit card numbers and don't act like you remember us. because you forgot about my party 20 30 mins after the reservation. n nanother thing. while waiting, there was nowhere to wait properly. we kept getting shooed away. n nthey also threatened to charge us for leaving after we waited 40 mins. can i say illegal? n ni wouldn't say don't go here. but be hella careful when you do. rude. but the place was nice!",1
"Came in for dinner tonight and had decided before I got there that I was going to try the veggie burger after reading so many rave reviews about it in the newspaper reviews recently. Now I am not a veggie burger kind of girl nor am I much on beef either I'm that weirdo turkey burger kind. This veggie burger was EXCELLENT and I would have it again in a heartbeat. The outside edges were a bit on the crispy side but the center was moist and delicious. n nMy son enjoyed the ?illy cheesesteak which was outstanding.and my friend enjoyed the marscapone burger which is always out of this world. Both enjoyed the crispy fries while I had my tried and true potato salad. I kind of wish they would try out macaroni salad for a little while but maybe I'll suggest it to Chef next time I'm in. We'll see. n nFriendly staff, clean establishment, and have really grown to love eating here! Plus enjoyed my 10 PTA discount. Can't beat that!",2
"I usually go to Pho Saigon 8 for Pho, but it was almost midnight when I got to Vegas and Pho Saigon 8 was closed. Remembered reading a review on this place, I thought I'd give it a try. n nI ordered the combination Pho with all the trimmings and I didn't like it at all! The broth was only lukewarm but what made me sick was that it smelled and tasted gamy. I had ordered a small bowl. As hungry as I was, I barely finished 1 2 of it and just gave up. It left such bad taste and memory in my mouth that I didn't want Pho during the rest of my stay! And let me tell you, I am a Pho natic and I can eat Pho everyday! n nThe service was not bad as the other reviewers described. In fact it was rather friendly. We were served water and menu right away as we sat down. But perhaps it was because we were one of the only 3 tables of customers there at the time. n nI will be better prepared next time and find another place to go to if I know I am going to arrive late to Vegas again.",1
"Really disappointed in my take away from here. I ordered a Chinese dish of chicken, spring onion and ginger and asked for some garlic to be thrown in which it wasn't and my girlfriend ordered a Thai dish. Both looked exactly the same colourless and gloopy. nMy Tom Yum soup was only half full and contained nothing more than some decent stock but only two prawns. nThe worst part of my meal was the boiled rice which was dry, hard and brittle. Probably the worst rice I've had from a take away. nAll of these negative points is really down to the place cutting corners and presumably heating things up in microwaves I think the rice was heated in the oven because it came in the foil tray . When you get spongy chicken and colourless veg in microwaveable dishes you know it's not going to be good. nAvoid.",1
Surprisingly affordable for being inside,2
"Went to this location at 745am. The kid in the drive thru needs a lesson in customer service etiquette. When I pulled up to the speaker I heard a ""Whats your order? "" And thats it. He didnt pronunciate his words and I could barely understand his mumbled words. It wasnt the low quality speaker because it was the same thing at the window. No eye contact, no manners. Just some little terd. The person that gave me my food was the same way and they didn't even give me napkins for a mcgriddle. Really? Napkins are expected qhen going through any fast food drive thru. This place sucked.",1
"Be flexible when you come here because there might be a really long wait if you don't have a reservation accepted for groups 4 or more . The food is a bit pricey spent 83 the other day for 2 adults and a child . Despite this, I really love the New Mexican cuisine and flavors, although more often than not, the food is a little too spicy for me. n nMy favorites are their bacon wrapped shrimp and roasted garlic plate. Fair warning that the menu is very similar to Richardsons. The other day, I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp 5 for 16 and thought it was the dinner. The server told me I was confusing it with Richardson's and that at Rokerij, it was an app. n nParking is valet, of course, which is a little annoying but standard in central Phoenix.",2
Service was professional and Amy was very informative. I would definitley recommend this place of business for services. Receptionist is is very courteous and makes you feel welcome.,2
"There we were in Las Vegas for evo 2012. We were cruising around Asian town heading back to our hotel while we saw it. I think the only reason why we wanted to go here because of the word ""Anime. "" We went there that night, and we noticed there were anime pictures on the walls. I was like, ""Ok. That's cool. "" When we went inside to be seated, we were all shocked and amazed to find out that all the workers were in cos play. We are all guys that are into anime. The only time we see cos play is during Kawaii con on Hawaii. The girls are all cute and Asian. How lovely. The one I liked the most was Ploy because she was our waitress. She is cheerful and cool. That night they had Kpop playing. It is like they were playing kpop songs out of my kpop playlist on my ipod. They also had anime movies or episodes playing. n nNow about the food. I loved it. . You just need to try. The vanilla tempura is to die for. I didn't share that. n nIf I go back to Vegas, we will go there again.",2
"We woke up late from an evening nap and headed our hungry bellies downstairs at 11pm. n nWhere else could you have a hefty, meaty buger with fries accompanied by the drink that you brought down from your room upstairs? Where else could you finish your meal off with a perfectly chilled shot of Patron? At the Lobby Bar and Cafe of course! n nFull bar, late night bites, steps from the hotel room elevators. I was sold!",2
Went in for an alignment. They charged extra for my civic being lowered. Never have I been charged extra at Goodyear or at my uncles ford shop for my car being lowered. Took over an hour. Service was ok but dont charge me extra for nonsense.,1
"I have made a yelp account today at this moment just to tell you my experience from this place. I have been here numerous times but don't really appreciate the standard customer service given at this place. This place I normally don't refer to friends but I decided to give this place one more shot due to my close friends wanting to eat this last night. Last night was the final draw for this place never have I ever felt violated, disrespected, and degraded in my life. We go here about 2 30 am after a night of long work and studying. It took the waiter 40 mins to take our order. We didn't get our compliment water, napkins, and utensils till all orders arrived. Numerous times have we tried to call a waiter over and cater to us all we got was stares and shut downs. They ignored for about 5 times, as they walked over and looked at us. As we finished up and was ready to pay, we waited at the cashier table for about 20 mins. The so called manager owner comes through a young skinny Asian boy. He tell him that we are going to split the check into two my friend will pay first and I'll pay second. We have a group of four people and two people on one check the other two on the next check. He tells us we have to figure it our ourselves. We ask for a calculator right in front of him he tells us no you figure it our yourselves. The phones rings as we were try to talk to him he ignores is the whole time. At this point I furious poor service, and now dealing with an ass of an owner. He tells me to ""shut the fuck up "" ""stop giving him attitude "" he also calls me a ""bitch "". At this point I'm ready to knock his ass out but I have to keep it collective, no one ever talks to me this way I was raised to knock bitches out if I was dissected especially in the way he treated me last night. I tell him ""bitch "" you do not know me don't you ever talk to me in that tone ever again. He then tells me to ""fuck off "" I don't care. I pay give no tip. As we were leaving he then runs outside trying to find security to kick me and my friends out saying we were trespassing when clearly I have to stay to pay the bill unless you want me to have a free meal. I leave he then tells me to ""get the fuck out "". I don't know about you but customer service and being a manager yourself customers are always right and never have I ever in my 25 years of living experience a manager owner swear at me. Do not I suggest do no! Ever go to this place ever!",1
"PFG for a lunch time burger. I had the double with cheese and bacon with some slaw on the side. Filled me up and gave me a greasy feeling all afternoon, but while eating it, I have to say it was really tasty. Don't come here expecting to find burger nirvana. Even writing this feels like I'm doing a review on a McDonalds or a Jack in the Box, but being from Hawaii and having never tried a Culver's butter burger before I'll give myself a pass this once. Basically it's a fast food place that kicks it's burgers up a notch by adding butter. If Mickey d's did this, they might have a law suit on their hands. But I say as long as it's legal, the butter burger plays. 3.5 stars.",2
"I went here today for the first time and I have to say that I fell in love all over again! Wow! Pizza is already my favorite food group, and the pizza at Redendo's rocks n' rolls! n nI had a pizza pinwheel, which was layers of fresh, chewy, melty, mozzarella cheese and spicy but not too spicy pepperoni, rolled into soft, yeasty, fresh pizza dough. This pizza dough is so good I wanted to wrap myself in it! And the three flavors together, mama mia! My friends had beautiful and ample ceasar salads, as well as the biggest calzone I've ever seen! They raved about their food! n nThe restaurant is decorated very comfortably, reminds me of a pizza place in brooklyn new york. Pictures of celebrities, new york yankees memorabilia, old signs, and more. Very cool, very clean, and comfortable for a family to go out to dinner together! If you haven't been there, you really need to try it! n nEnjoy!",2
Dining room is a little dingy for a chain. Ripped seat cushions and a messy condiment bar. Drive through does not get orders exact e.g. Ask to hold the cheese ensures a hamburger with cheese .,1
"Great cheesesteaks, clean, and everyone here is very friendly! n nWhat more could you ask from from a steakshop?",2
Tonight my bf and I was here the service was alright the buggers was good the fries was a bit over cooked,1
"After hearing about this place from a friend and DDD, I finally went there to check it out! needless to say, it is a pizza joint in a bar or vice versa! Let's get that straight, it is not going to be the cleanest, fanciest, nor is it going to appeal everybody! What it lacks in these things, is the character of the bar and FOOD! n nLike everybody says, the Stromboli here is one of the better ones around! Even better is that it's 50 off after midnight! Beers are ice cold! The Boli's are hot, crispy, flavorful! And the staff is pretty cool! n nThe downside is, it is in BFE in terms of people who don't live around in immediate area! But oh well! A small price to pay for a damn good Stromboli! n nCheers!",2
"Stopped in during a recent visit to Vegas for Superbowl weekend. I gotta say I was impressed. I had the small 9' I think it was meatball and it was bigger than most foot longs that you would get at Subway or whatever. Another thing, is these were all solid sandwiches, not like Subway where the thing is mostly lettuce and very little meat and cheese. The meatball and sauce was tasty and the bread was nice and soft. Yeah this place is a lil pricey but you get what you pay for. This one was conveniently Located directly across from the Hard Rock where we were staying but I guess they have them all over the greater Las Vegas area. Oh, the one bad thing is it was kind of a wait so don't go here if you're in a rush.",2
"If you think you are going to authentic Senior Frog you will be disappointed. It might be owned by the same corporate group, but this one has nothing in common with the Senior Frog's of Mexico. Entertainment, if you can call it that is 80's and 90's hits with quality of the college dorm. Food is lousy at best and overpriced even by the Strip standards. A burrito for 18 has a quality of roadside gas station and unfriendly, stonewall faces of servers will not help either. Location on the strip at TI behind the closed pirate ship, collecting dust is the only thing Senior Frog has going for it",1
"First of the lack of rating is due to service, food was really good. We went for happy hour. Had the best rib ever! The service was less than desirable. First off it was just slower, which was not a big deal. Then in my last bite of a slider there was a small piece of plastic. I told the server and he just took it and walked to another employee whom I thought was manager. They did not come over did not apologize and in fact never really spoke to us again. And there was no offer to comp or reduce cost. All they need to do to save this visit is act like they cared. I guess I should have just choked on the piece.",1
"Two stars for the duck pond. That's it. Margs taste like sugar water, food overpriced and actually tasteless. I feel bad because I used to love this place and I know people that work there. n But the food sucked last two times and the service was so so. Got a super bad vibe from my server because we just ordered apps that sucked one was so bad we returned it. Anyways, two dry tamales and three margs house! were 34.00. Still tipped 8. Sorry I didn't spend 75 but I won't spend even 30 again there. Bad food, rude service. Nice duck pond. That's all ya got.",1
NOT the same as the original locations. Food was not hot and just doesn't taste the same. Dissatisfied. Very.,1
"I absolutely loved this place. My family is Israeli, so my standards for middle eastern food are very high. I was so impressed by the food here. I got the shopska and chicken kebab the last time I ate here and it was really fresh and so delicious. Plus, the staff here are extremely friendly. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere inside. Its very pleasant. I would like to come back sometime for a drink with friends. Its close to where I work, so I will definitely be coming back again and again!",2
"I went to this place recently for dinner. They have good looking food but average tasting. Salt was not right in all the items we ordered. Table service was not good too. For some reason the waiter was in hurry to clean the table and indirectly putting pressure on us to finish sooner. n nWhile we were having food, there was incident in restaurant. One of the guest fell while her chair broke during getting up. Waiter serving us saw it and did not even bother to extend help or ask if she was OK. He just moved to serve other table. That was bad as other guests had to help the other person get up. Even manager did not seem too concerned when the guest complained. n nFor the price they charge for the food and based on other reviews, I expected lot more. I would not go again.",1
"Went here because I can pick it up on the way home. I wasn't expecting anything great, probably around the level of China Saute from a years ago . I was very surprised! The veggies are very fresh and all the breaded chicken dishes are just right. It's not greasy or overly breaded. n nI have tried about five different dishes and they were all delicious.",2
"Excellent flavors. Stuffed Dates and Terra y Mare Skewers were my favorites. Packed with flavor. The sauce on the Terra y Mare Skewers was delicious. The Smoked Salmon Toasts were pretty average but tasty with the capers. And the Empanadas were only average. The ground meat inside wasn't that impressive, and the aioli on top was a negative for me but I'm not a fan of mayonnaise based sauces. n nBerry and lychee infused vodka. Sounds good. Love lychee. But didn't love this housemade vodka. n nThey have a small patio seating area, which would be fun to sit at when it's cooler not in the middle of summer , so keep that in mind when planning a visit to this tapas restaurant. There's also a main dining area and bar with a detached dining area next door. Dark ambience and not really a good place for little kids with the squished seating. n nLemon berry tartlets for dessert were excellent but a tapas sized portion. Enough to clean the palate and satisfy a sweet craving but not nearly enough if you like to have your large portion dessert at the end of a meal. n nOverall, it was great as a food experience. If you're sick of eating at the big expensive steak restaurants on the strip, try this place.",2
This restaurant is the worst I've ever been. The hotel screed up my room and now this diner. Service is the worst and food is not far. The hotel deserve to be at the last hotel of the strip.,1
"Small gem hidden in a strip center, community tables, first come first serve. Menu is limited to pizza and a couple of salads and appetizers, but they were all good had three different types of pizza with a group to share . They are a micro brew and it was AZ beer week, so the ""theme "" that night was all their beers other times they have their own plus other brands we had several different ones. I had the cream ale and it was a good option for me since I am more of a wine and domestic beer drinker not too heavy and very smooth. It was a cool vibe, laid back and not stuffy at all. I would definitely go back.",2
Great place for quick pho take out! I love the fresh spring rolls and the Thai Iced Tea!,2
"Date Night! 45 min wait on a Fri night 7pm. We had the Old Fashion Burger and the Farfalle Chicken pasta. Both were very good would get them again. Service was not the best we've had. Cheesecake is always the highlight of this place. We had a hard time choosing Reese's PB was a little strong, Red Velvet was PERFECT!",2
"TOTAL liars. They act like they have this huge inventory of cars, however they just search the internet and get the car from another dealership. They pay dealership profit and charge you a fee which allows them to take advantage of customers both ways. In this internet world, we should just find the cars we want on our own. They lied to us and will never ever use thier serivce. I have asked to speak with the owner but he is never in the office.",1
"Very cool Irish pub in New York New York! Great beer selection, great atmosphere and nice servers.",2
"This review is for the maternity ward specifically. n nI have had 2 children here and it was such an awesome experience both times. Dr. Morris is the best OB GYN, hands down. He delivered our first daughter and even when he wasn't able to deliver our second, he made sure we were comfortable with the other doctor on staff that night she was also from his practice, Providence Women's Care . n nEvery nurse we encountered in labor and delivery, the aftercare maternity ward, and the nursery was just amazing. They even have lactation consultants that come through after you have your baby to answer any questions and to make sure breastfeeding is going well. n nThe hospital food is much better than most and they offer a lot of different options. n nThe labor and delivery rooms and the post birth rooms are so great. They have everything you need which is very helpful if you forgot something in your rush to the hospital. n nOverall, I highly recommend this hospital and Novant Health as a whole.",2
"Food Was good. Service was horrible. n nGot into the pub about 6 50pm and was excited to see the happy hour specials. 50 all appetizers 4 7pm. WELL, you had better make sure that your waitress, or in my case the bartender enter in your complete order prior to 7pm or you will not get any discount. I ordered my drink at 6 58 according to the computer and my appetizer order was not for an additional 3 minutes. Yes, that is right 7 01pm and I did not qualify for the happy hour price. n nAre you kidding me? it took the bartender 8 minutes to get to me, and there were only 8 people at the bar. n nI honestly do not know if I will go back just on principal. And this being a Seahawks bar. and I am a Seahawks fan. n nIt just goes to show that customer service has really become a thing of the past. n nCW",1
"Worst. Visit. Ever. n nI ordered chicken fried chicken, I got country fried steak. Once that got corrected, my chicken was burnt and dry. My corn was mushy. n nMy mother's country fried steak was dry. n nMy brother found an eyelash in his eggs. n nMy sister in law had old vegetables. n nOur server was great, no complaints there. The kitchen needs to fix it up though!",1
"The service here stinks. If the associates aren't cursing on the floor, maybe I'd feel comfortable spend my money here. Along with the fact that u have to talk to other staff members like they're stupid just so they understand something as simple as a first and last name. Terrible.",1
"I've used this florist for the last few years because the flowers are of good quality. Unfortunately, they have a problem counting. Last year I ordered 2 dozen roses for delivery and my wife received only 1 dozen. They refunded the difference so I decided to try them again this year. Well, I was disappointed again. They delivered 23 roses. I just can't use them any more.",1
"I've heard all the hype about JJ's for a few months now. In need of lunch I figured this would be a good time to give them a shot! Why not I thought, a good number of people I know tried them and thought they were good. This should be a pretty safe bet. n nStrike 1 Complete confusion with my order of two subs on line! They promote the fact you can order on line, but whats the point if it takes three employees who ask what your name is 5 times! n nStrike 2 The fresh baked French bread was rock hard, and had no flavor what so ever. You should promote fresh baked bread, if it comes off as being a few days old. n nStrike 3 The sub was named Smoked Ham Club. If you use the word ""smoked "" to describe the ham that is used, it should have a smoked flavor! In actuality, you will get the saltiest lowest quality tasting ham that can be sold. n nMy only hope for this franchise is that other locations have a much higher standard. If this is how every location is quality wise, JJ's will not last very long in the Valley.",1
"This restaurant would've received four stars because the chicken red curry was spicy and tasty, the happy hour cocktail was great, and the edamame was perfectly salted. And even though our server was a newbie, she was still attentive and got answers to all our happy hour and menu Qs. n nUnfortunately, none of this matters because I got food poisoning. I'm guessing from the chicken because no one else in my party got ill and I was the only one who ordered chicken. Worst 48 hours of my life. I'll never return.",1
"We came to watch a soccer game and asked if they're going to show it and the hostess told us they will. nWe found out theyre not showing it after we sat on the bar and asked the bartenders if they can switch the channel after we waited for 15 minutes with nothing happening. Eventually we decided to leave. nAlso there was a bartender who was very rude to us while we sat there, didn't pay attention to us and waved us with a laughing smile when we left.",1
"Its OK for what it is. Menu is about as Cheesecake factory, which can be a bit overwhelming. Late night service is spotty at best,went for breakfast at 12pm and again at 430 am breakfast was the best service I've had in an while! But the late night not so much. Burger dry and waited 30 minute's for them to for get an item for tofgo",1
"This specific Baton Rouge has always been a disappointment for me and I didn't come here by choice since I had friends in town and we were headed to the hockey game. n nThis is where the problem lies. n nThis place is EXTREMELY popular on game nights with a line up stretching outside into the rain of over 100 patrons during game nights. They know it and they exploit it when they provide an ""Event Night "" catalog that limits you to the most expensive options they can such as an 18 burger and fries being one of the cheaper ""meals "" available. n nGone are the other good options such as the chicken salad or chicken tenders, here are all the shrimp, duck, BBQ rib options for nearly 30 . NY Steak for 38? Really? n nWhat a rip off. n nTake a long moment to read more reviews on this place and make sure you REALLY want to come to this Baton Rouge, particularly if there's an event going on at the Bell Center. n nMind you I'm a huge fan of this chain and regularly go to the Laval one where prices are 30 40 less, the portions are bigger and the selection is unhindered. n nI ordered the Burger and fries and they were decent. I'm a huge fan of the fries the burger was decently cooked though the waiter never bothered to ask me how I'd like to have my burger. n nThe meals are provided very quickly and the staff LOVES to fill your soda to the top with ice. I made sure she confirmed with me refills are allowed before I let her serve me my drink. n nAll in all, in the particular experience, it sucked. I wanted my chicken tenders. Couldn't have them. Settled for something less and still felt ripped off.",1
Still a true 5 star resort! Great amenities and luxury.,2

"Room was OK. Free Internet, breakfast n shuttle to airport and strip. But shuttle runs only between 7.30AM to 10.30PM. I saw roaches in the room. That some what made me mad. Room has mini fridge, coffee maker, stove, sink and microwave. Over all it was OK.",1
First 1 star review. Came in at 6 20 on a Tuesday. Completely out of chicken breasts in both original and crispy. None in the cooker. 20 minute wait if I wanted them to cook me one.,1
"The Hubby and I were able to come for dinner last night, and we enjoyed it. We started with the duck fat fries with the egg and Bearnaise, it was very very good. The Bearnaise was very tarragon flavored, which I liked. I had the crispy chicken thighs the Hubby had a burger and we both enjoyed our meals. I appreciate well seasoned food, but my meal was over salted a bit too much. Other than that, it tasted great. The fingerlings were awesome and the chicken skin was sooo crisp, very good! I liked that the use of fresh herbs stood out, but didn't take over. We finished with the creme brulee and it was also very good, thick rich custard, smooth, perfect.",2
"DIAH has been our vet hospital of choice for the past ten years. Whether it's with our dogs or our cats we always return time and time again to see Dr. Willey, DVM, and the staff at Desert Inn. What makes this vet hospital so special? Besides my favorite veterinarian in town they are also willing to consult specialists and have the best equipment in order to ensure your animals are healthy, happy and safe. We love our vet hospital and recommend it to anyone who asks! Could you pay less elsewhere? Yes. To be honest, yes, you could, but other vet hospitals have to schedule visiting ultrasound techs to come in for ultrasounds. DIAH has an ultrasound machine in the back. Other vets still use the old fashioned xrays that need to be shot, developed and then looked at. DIAH has a great set up that basically sends your xrays to a computer monitor in which the veterinarian can change the exposure and zoom into different areas. DIAH also has a host of specialists on hand to help out. Think your pet has a blockage? Your personal vet will look at the xrays, but often they will have a radiologist double check to ensure nothing was missed. You are paying for QUALITY of service and the quality of equipment as well. n nAlso, not to forget Dr. Arn and Dr. Lingwall are exceptional vets as well and we recommend them if you are looking for a wonderful crop for Danes. n nIf you have a Sphynx or Savannah kitten, however, we always recommend Dr. Willey. She's our kitties' favorite vet even if they are a wee bit naughty!",2
"This place is adorable! I love the decor and ambiance! They have private rooms in the very front of the restaurant unfortunately facing the parking lot! but they are beautiful! The happy hour at the bar only from 5 7 pm is awesome. they have bottomless mimosas for 8! n nThe rolls are great, averagely priced sushi for the location. You'd think Red Rock would be charging 15 minimum per roll, but no. You can get a roll for 8 11 just like everywhere else. Great place for a first date!",2
This gym alone is alright. What makes me mad the most is people are using the 30 minute express machines out of order. And they just sit there. It's annoying. At this gym you can use the hydro massage table for only 7 minutes. At the the other gyms they're 10 minutes. I don't understand why this one is different. Another issue is kids. This is not a day care! It's been let known that you cannot bring your children. The tanning rooms are a A . Overall this gym is clean and put together nicely.,2
"Ok, it must get better over time. I hope ! Grand opening, and the place wasn't too packed. Got my red velvet, chai latte, lemon meringue, triple cinnamon, and vanilla. All were way too dry, and lacked flavor with the exception of the lemon. But still way to dry! They must've baked way too many and had them sit out way too long. That's what I get for going to their grand opening. I just pray this isn't what to expect in the future, as I will just stick to their ice cream.",1
"Zipps is a local favorite and honestly has the best wings I have ever had. Between their 32 ounce beers, medium golden honey wings and happy hour specials this is the place to be for sports events. n nIt does get packed quickly and the TV selection is a little iffy at the Camelback location but the food and atmosphere make up for it!",2
I go to Tempe Bikes for parts I do my own repairs and they are unfailingly knowledgeable and helpful. They even put up with me when I am all grubby and grumpy because I realized half way through a repair that tool I own is for a different style of bike or any number of other problems . First class operation.,2
"I am editing my review and adding a star because of the owner's thoughtful and sincere response to my earlier posting. I really appreciate when a business owner takes the time to respond to online reviews and I would love to see this particular restaurant do well. As a vegan it means a lot to me when restaurants offer vegetarian alternatives. While my first experience wasn't the most positive, I can see that others have had much better experiences. It may have been an off day, so I will keep an open mind and maybe stop back the next time I'm in the area.",1

"Where else but Uptown could you get huge homemade biscotti for 2 and Hungarian language lessons for free? I noticed that the sugar container said ""Sugar "", and also ""Azucar "" Spanish , and. ""Cukar "". I asked if that was Turkish. No, said the cute guy behind the counter, that's Hungarian. Turkish would have been ""seker "", I learned later. n nI know only one phrase in Hungarian, I said ""Halv u00e1ny fogalmam sincs "". He smiled and said it in English ""I have no idea.

I came here from just looking at the yelp app and just looking for a nearby place for breakfast. I was afraid there may be lines and I would have to wait but we arrived at 9 30 and we were seated immediately. Every table is full so that must say something about the place. nI ordered the Brooklyn Benedict and it was amazing. The sauce was not too buttery and simply just smooth. nOJ was just ok I'm not sure if it's freshly juiced or if it is from a carton,2
"Great atmosphere, great wine, great food. Sometimes has a band or artist playing music which is nice. Staff is knowledgeable about their wine and food which is always a plus. It is not too loud so it would be a great meet up place for a date or to see some friends. Location, location location! NODA is a great spot for a wine bar like this. Love that they had a Yelp deal so that I was able to try things for half off.",2
"I have to admit that I do not do a lot of shopping at this location, the fact that it also has a USPS outlet is the reason I go. Even with that, they staff is always friendly and they do not seem to mind the traffic generated by the Post office.",2
"My wife and i had our 5 year anniversary and chose to look into a few places to have a nice casual dinner. Being 5p.m. or so we chose the yelp option on what was close and nearby. After reading a few reviews i picks this place. GREAT choice food, atmosphere, staff and overall experience was fabulous. We had a beautiful view of the rolling hills, and veiws of mesa, tempe and planes flying in. The waitress was very knowledgeable on all the items and questions we had. She was very pleasant, and seemed happy to be able to work with and for us. My wife ordered the chicken and featherling potatoes with a quickly fried side of greens. She loved them, and I had the steak pasta. Both dishes were better than expected and after dinner there was a complimentary dessert. Chocolate cake. If you are looking for a place that will be memorable and has great food. This is the place. Next time im in the area I WILL be in my favorite restaurant for the setting of the sun. Thanks for making our day so special.",2
"Went here when they first opened. Happily sat on the smoking patio and had some shots with 8 friends we got to come hang with us. Was lacking music, even low, on the patio. As expected after a few rounds of shots, in a bar, we got laughing. Security told us to quiet down so we don't disrupt the neighbors in the back. Huh? nOtherwise I had no complaints at the time. But never returned. If I have some drinks and shots in a bar, I hope to laugh loud. nMaybe this policy has changed since and calls for a revisit ?",1
"I adopted a Puggle 2 years ago. I immediately signed him up for training classes at The Dog Den. While not everything that we learned stuck through no fault of The Dog Den everyone there was very caring. About a year later I took him back for daycare, and Cooper LOVED it. He attended 2 days a week, and they always worked with me to accommodate my schedule and get him in last minute when needed. Cooper always came home happy and exhausted, it doesn't get any better than that! I have recently moved out of state and can't find a day care as awesome as The Dog Den.",2

This is such a little gem. The curry was perfect and I was so happy to see that we could add the spices ourselves.

"I was a little hesitant about giving Old Homestead a try when I first glanced through the menu. Although it is very pricy I decided to give it a try due to its reputation. I'm glad to say I was not disappointed. n nI'm from Texas and know exactly how a steak should taste so I was impressed by the way my steak was made. I ordered the 14 oz New York Sirloin done medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was quite large so maybe order an appetizer and split an entree and get desert like my wife and I did. The calamari was some of the best I ever had and for dessert we went with the creme brulee. n nAfter the meal was done the total came out to a little under 150 for the both of us which is not bad at all to me compared to some fine steakhouses I've been to. Overall, our dinner was fantastic and my wife and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.",2
"I was referred to Select Import by Just Inspections down the street when I failed my emissions inspection. Just Inspections first suggested I go to Toyota the dealership, as my car as a Camry because they thought my car's issues might be covered under the Toyota recall. Turns out my car was too old of a model, but I found it very impressive that Select suggested that instead of just doing the repair and taking the money. nToyota could have repaired my car, but I called Select again and they quoted me several hundred dollars less than the Toyota dealership, so I went back to them. Car was taken care of quickly and efficiently. I had to drive the car another 30 miles to be re tested for emissions, but Select told me to come back and they'd check it out for me free before I had it reinspected. So I did, they checked it out quickly, and I passed my inspection. nThis is a fabulous place with great customer service especially Stephanie who I dealt with the whole time and who also talked me through some stressful situations at the Toyota dealership . Id go there again in an instant and highly recommend it.",2

Only visit this Walmart if I need something for an emergency. I am always asked for money even before I park my car. The customers inside leave it a mess and are very rude. The parking lot is full of trash and carts are everywhere. Seriously do not like this Walmart at all!,1

"This is the only indoor mall worth visiting in the West Valley. n nFood court is above average. Gotta love having choices like Johnny Rockets and Orange Julius. n nGetting my shop on here isn't half bad.

If you're looking for electronics, they've got that, too, with a massive Apple Store, as well as Radio Shack. n nSo if you want a clean, convenient shopping experience, make this your stop. Except for Sundays.ugh.the parking lot is horrendous.",2
"The lunch special available until 2pm is a nice amount of food for the money and is very tasty. Having said that, we aren't so sure that the owners are all that fond of their patrons. Sometimes it can feel as if they are annoyed that you showed up! Or maybe that's just the hawaiian way? We're also not too sure how sanitary it is to be preparing food, chopping vegetables and the like in the dining room where customers are? We suppose, as long as they keep serving up the tasty bbq chicken, and we don't get sick, we'll keep going back!",2
"Let me start off by saying ""WOW "". I first thought this was some hole in the wall bbq place in NC but then I was truly shocked about how great the food was. I don't eat too much friend chicken but the way they cook season there chicken is like no other. Then you got these sources they dip the chicken in was is just amazing. We order a half of chicken dipped, coleslaw, bang bang shrimp and a cake. I enjoyed every bit of it so much that I went back the next day. The next time I'm in charlotte again I'm hitting this place up for sure. The customer service was also just a good and very friendly people who take the time to explain discuss the menu with you. I can't wait to go back ahhh that chicken was so good!",2
"When thinking of casinos off the Strip, there's a temptation to think of them as modest, and merely meant for locals. Red Rock's luxurious facility both surprised and impressed me there's a lot to do! n nThis casino resort has a cornucopia of features, including a bowling alley, spa, food court, multiple restaurants, and conference center capabilities. Their hotel lobby lounge features a 32 foot long chandelier, draped by an elegant staircase. There's a few stores, and a Starbucks overlooking the lobby. The casino's decor is sharp, and the restaurants lining it mirror that theme. The nearly 3,000 slot machines can confound if you're trying to find people, so pay attention to your surroundings. n nWe had a spacious suite near the spa, with a view of the Strip and top notch amenities modern decor, huge soft mattresses, a comfy couch, a widescreen plasma TV, and a convenient bottle of Patron costs extra . Loved the bathroom, and the luxurious shower. The toilet had a phone by it, and the marble tub, a TV. Besides hearing wind whistling one morning it was crazy windy out there , Red Rock's hotel, casino, and lounges all had a fit and finish that made our dollars feel well spent. n nHotel service was stellar. When I needed help late night, both Tanya at the front desk and a bellhop assisted. When we needed a random feminine hygiene product, not only did room service stock necessities, a staffer delivered the goods to our door minutes later. When hunger hit, concierge Stephanie pointed out some nearby Thai restaurants. n nIf you're planning on heading to the Strip, keep in mind that Red Rock is off strip. If you're content with hailing a taxi, or are a local, this shouldn't be an issue. n nMy single regret from my stay at Red Rock? Not playing bingo in their huge bingo hall.",2
The burgers are very good. Many combinations to choose from. I have recommended this restaurant to friends visiting Las Vegas and they all have come back and thanked me. Stop into Lush for a free hand message afterwards.,2

"Bottom Line Up Front Smaller dog park with reasonable grass coverage. Two entrances make easy access. No shade to speak of, so be careful on hot days. n nHere are my star breakdowns n nThe first star required is for having a fenced in area to let rover rex sport buffy etc run until he she is a reasonable companion again. n nThe second star is for having great parking right next to the park, which is just far enough off of the main road to be reasonably quiet. n nThe third star, pushing this review up to the ""worth a re visit "" level is for having grass in a town known for pavement and hard pan desert.

"The staff is awesome, and you could not ask for friendlier people. n nHowever, I have been coming to this place for about four years. The food quality has been steadily going down hill. The wings and portions are getting smaller and more expensive. The quality of the wings rates to barely edible. n nThis place needs to get another food vendor, because the quality is horrible. Then retrain the staff to get the order right.

We went to Sugar Factory for my bachelorette party lunch. We were seated quickly but waited 15 minutes for our server to come say hello. After we ordered our food it came out fast but we needed ketchup. When my bridesmaid and wonderful friend waved a server to get his attention he looked straight at her and even heard her then he just continued to walk away in the middle of her sentence and pretend not to hear. Thankfully my friend was able to wave over another server and she had no problem getting our ketchup. Maybe that guy has issues with ketchup. I give it a one because no one treats my friends with disrespect. The food was amazing and all our drinks were great! yummm!,1
"Dropped in to visit with company I was entertaining from out of state. Greeted by Costa who directed us to the patio and provided menus, but took forever to return to take our order. Placed order for 2 drinks and 3 appetizers. By the time food arrived, drinks were empty. Requested another round. Costa never returned. Had to go looking for him. Found him, he apologized, and STILL took FOREVER to deliver our drinks. In our boredom from waiting so long, we assembled a pyramid out of the appetizer plates. Costa treated us like we were invisible. Always polite enough when finally remembering to himself that we were sitting out on the patio, but inexcusable, horrible service. Had to ask for a bill, then had to hunt him down to pay for it because Costa kept performing the great ""disappearing act "". Absolutely the WORST service I have ever experienced.",1
"I was looking for a suitable venue to watch the IU Georgia basketball game with my family. Lagasse's Stadium seemed to fit the bill. A big name chef lending his name to a sports bar sports book in the Palazzo.what could be better? Lagasse's Stadium is a huge, multi level sports bar cum sports book with HD large screen flat panels dispersed liberally around the establishment. It offers a full service bar and menu with the usual bar food suspects, presumably with the Emeril ""bam! "" Lagasse's Stadium has plenty of table seating as well as lounge seating with a personal HD flat panel for your area. We elected to sit in a lounge for our semi private viewing of the game. n nAs a venue to watch your game goes, Lagasse's Stadium is first rate. Sadly, where it falls way short is the one place you'd think it would be nailed down tight, the food. We started off on a good foot with the Tuna Poke Chips appetizer 15 . The diced Ahi tuna and avocado were fresh tossed in a ponzu vinaigrette and served atop crispy wonton chips which were drizzled with a spicy Chinese mustard. It came with a small wakame salad on the side. The app was flavorful without being overdressed with the vinaigrette. The only negative was the 15 price for the amount received. However, after our app, the wheels fell off of the chuck wagon. My dad and I ordered Oyster Po Boy 16 sandwiches. Both of our po boys came with what should've been four large sized, fried oysters on New Orleans style French Bread with lettuce, tomato and Creole mayonnaise. Sadly, our oysters were deep fried into submission leaving only a slightly burnt flavored batter and sad, desiccated oysters within. I've been to New Orleans. I know Emeril has been there, too. No way would he ever mistake these poorly executed excuses for authentic Po Boys. Lagasse's Stadium delivered something that was practically worthless at twice the price of what a po boy could be found in New Orleans. My mom ordered the Fish and Chips 15 . Yet again, the kitchen failed to properly execute the dish. The beer battered cod was nicely fried and not too greasy, but the fried fish was way over salted to the point of being inedible. Not even alcohol could overcome the food fail since Lagasse's Stadium's beer and spirits selection was entirely lackluster. If I'm going to pay a premium price for a drink to wash down the overpriced, poorly executed food, then you should have something premium on your drink menu. At least our server was personable, attentive, but not intrusive. The service and the fact that IU beat Georgia were about the only positives of our visit. n nEmeril, if you're going to lend your well respected name in the culinary world to any establishment, even if it's only a sports bar on steroids, then you should make sure the bar food that they serve meets your same minimum standards that you'd require at Delmonico, Table 10, or your eponymous Emeril's Fish House. If I were a judge on Top Chef like you, and you served this food to me, I would tell you to pack your knives and go.",1
I tried this again due to the free giveaway sent out in the mail! YUCK! still no hair nets and Kristen was rude about it too!

"Go to the original in San Antonio instead. Vegas transplants good stuff from everywhere but this location is a poor imitation of the original. Food is just OK and too expensive like everything else on the strip. n nOur waitress wasn't surly she just spent the evening flirting with my husband.

That was the one and only disturbing thing about this hotel having to see a bunch of half naked, oiled up Australians on billboards plastered on walls throughout the hotel. Chills.",2

"You remember that scene in Sopranos when Toni and Paulie go to Italy, so excited for the Italian food? But once they are there, everything on the menu seems foreign to Paulie? This is what I imagine some Italians must feel after coming to this pizza joint. n nIt is a cute restaurant located in Little Italy, and there are usually lines outside. It has a family run feel, and has been there since 1948. There are plenty of selection of both pizzas and pastas. We sampled both pizzas and pastas, and didn't feel like either were exceptional in any way. The pizza crust tasted store bought, and the pasta was bland and creamy. It wasn't what I was hoping for, but maybe that is because everyone has told me that the best pizza in Montreal is found here, and I guess I was a lot disappointed. And the house made tiramisu was so wrong, we couldn't even finish it. n nIt is a very family friendly spot, and the service felt uneven. One other thing, you should BYOW, which again made me feel very very far away from Italy.",1

"Ok so this review is for 03 27 2009, which was over a week ago. I usually review places that I love right away, so that just tells you this was a forgettable experience. We had a large party of about 10 people so we had to get two tables together, which the staff here did accommodate our needs very quickly. However, that was probably the best part of my dining experience here. n nA very abrupt, rude waiter took our order. The food literally took one hour to get to us. By the time it got to us, we were debating on whether leave, wait for the food or butter our napkins and eat THEM instead. I ordered the petite fillet with asparagus and mac n'cheese. For me, the steak was ok but I have had much better at Craft Steak. The mac n' cheese was pretty good, but not fantastic. Definitely NOT memorable. n nThey took forever to bring the bill to us when we were finished. It was about 65 85 per couple. I wouldn't have paid Black Angus prices for this place. I gave this place two stars, one for the friendly hostess who accommodated us right away, and one for the fresh, crisp asparagus and the mac n' cheese. I will NOT be back!",1

"Well, I just had dinner from this place and felt I had to write about it immediately. This is the second time I've had Rosati's. Last time I wasn't impressed at all. Previously I had their ""double dough "" pizza, which is ""twice as thick "" as the thin'n'crispy dough. Whatever. It wasn't great the first time. However the father in law has had some pizzas from the Anthem location and said he really liked it. Tonight we were looking for something quick to eat and I suggested one of the various pizza places around Surprise. Anyway, we decided to give it another chance. I went and got a take out order of their pan style ""classic combo "". n nThe second time round, they failed miserably. I love pan pizzas, not the cracker crust crap. The box was pretty heavy which was a good thing. I brought it home and revealed the contents, with the wife watching eagerly it was after 9pm . The first thing that registered was a little confusion. Granted, the pizza was very thick, but it looked like someone had just poured a can of freakin peeled tomatos over the top of the pizza and then half heartedly dusted some parmesan cheese on it. What the? I've never seen anything like it. The tomato base and chunks were on the TOP of the cooked cheese and other ingredients! Well, whatever, I figured that was probably the Sicilian way or something. Next up, both of us had to get a teflon spatula to pick up the pieces since the whole top of the pizza was soggy. The dough was still firm underneath, so after wrestling with the ultra stringy mozzarella we busted out the TV trays and commenced dining. n nIt tasted okay. We used knives and forks. I tend to do this rather than wind up with a hand that looks like I've just helped a cow give birth. But after the ten mins or so I spent carving my way through the morass of toppings, my third and final slice was soggy as hell by that time the toppings had finally seeped down to the bottom of the dough. I couldn't get through it. By the time I was done, I'm not even kidding, my plate looked like what I had left in the bottom of a toilet in Portland last year when I was violently ill after having one of those churrascarria Brazilian meat shower meals. Just red muck, meat pieces and a combination of crisp and soggy pan dough. Please see the photo camphone I'll attach showing the pizza after we'd taken a few slices of it. n nI'll never go back. A complete waste of money. However, it wasn't the WORST pizza I've ever had that honour belongs to Pizza Pizzazz in Sydney , and they MIGHT have gotten two stars if they'd remembered that 1 their pizza ingredient list on the website DIDN'T include canned tomatoes and 2 tomato base is laid on the dough FIRST before the rest of the toppings. So yeah, crossing another one off my list. Definitely the ""Mozilla Firefox "" of pizza joints second rate, badly prepared and something to be avoided by all but the terminally clueless.",1

"I wish Fugu was more than it is. It's not horrible, but it's not particularly good either. I was there with a friend and I ordered pork and beancurd in a garlic sauce, which I know the name of in Chinese, but the translation they had on the menu is probably not the best. n nThe sauce wasn't particularly good. It was spicy like it should be but too thick and gelatinous. My dish was smothered in it and I couldn't really taste anything but the garlic sauce. I think this is the same garlic sauce that they use in several of their dishes. The pork and beancurd was more like a vehicle for mediocre sauce. n nGrowing up in LA though, I may be spoiled by my idea of good Chinese food and this doesn't even begin to compare with the myriad of options in LA.

That goes for the portion sizes of foods and drinks as well get your mind out of the gutter . n nUpon arriving at Fat Tuesday in the shopping area of Planet Hollywood, I was so excited that I already knew what size I wanted to get. I ended up going big and hard by ordering the 100 oz. Peach Bellini for 36 and an extra shot of 151 for 1. It was already around 9 30pm and we were extremely full from eating at Wicked Spoon an AYCE buffet that we decided that it would be a good time to fill our stomachs up with some fruity alcoholic slurpees. I also tried the other flavors that my friends got, but I thought that the Peach Bellini was my favorite P n nThe 100 oz. is EPIC. It came with it's own carrying strap that you can wrap around your neck just in case you get tired of carrying it. And trust me, not only was it a struggle to finish the 100 oz. but it got pretty heavy. It literally felt like I was lifting dumbbells and getting buzzed at the same time. I'd have to say that's pretty awesome that you're able to get a good workout in while having a good time n nWhat's also cool about getting the 100 oz. is that we get to keep it forever. So whenever I get Vegas Fat Tuesday withdrawals, I can pull out the 100 oz. and fill it up with alcohol and 7 11 slurpees. Don't worry, I am not an alcoholic. n nDefinitely try this place when you are in Vegas and worth coming back to as well!",2
"This place is by far the worst flooring company in town. When you walk in to the store you are greeted by one of the most aggravating and obnoxious people I have ever had to deal with in my life Steve and should have ran then and there but I wanted to give him a chance. After listening to him babble on and on for about 30 minutes about Feng Shui and Steve Wynn and how his company is the best in town I finally selected some flooring that I liked and scheduled a 20 up front appointment for someone to come out and measure. After waiting for over 30 minutes past the time I scheduled I called Steve and he said that he was coming to measure because ""his other guy "" cancelled. About 10 minutes later Steve shows up, cigarette in hand, and tells me his 20 minute story about Feng Shui and Steve Wynn AGAIN and then proceeds to sketch my homes floor plan BY HAND and tells me that he is a master draftsman, blah, blah, blah. I honestly could have done a better and more accurate floorplan with an etch a sketch. nSo anyways Steve finishes up and tells me to come down to the store in about a week for an estimate. I go in and he does give me a decent price that included free upgraded padding, etc and he asks me to put down a 700 deposit which I do. One week before the job is to be done he calls me and says that he spoke with his installer and there is no way that they can do what I want with the flooring I selected and I will have to go with another flooring that is about 1500 more expensive. At this point I know I am being scammed and I tell him that I am no longer comfortable with the arrangement and just want to cancel everything. He said, that since they couldn't do it, he would let us out of ""the contract "". So I contacted another floor place and made arrangements for them to complete the job. Steve then calls me, to tell me that we are in ""contract "" and that I have to use him, or else, we will have to pay him 700 ""res stocking fee "". Seriously? After being told it was impossible, suddenly its not longer impossible, we have to pay to upgrade the job or lose our money. Talk about a LOSE LOSE situation. Terrible, TERRIBLE service, awful people and just plain scam artists. Hope my 700 buys you plenty of hot dogs, Steve.",1

"I feel compelled to leave a review for Bella Nails and Spa because I just had the worst service of my life. Getting your nails done should be a relaxing experience. This place is anything but that. The lady I had was the rudest. I requested a color and she proceeded to argue with me about it. It was a gel nail color and on the wall was listed under a certain name and Opi brand. When she started to do my nails she pulled out another brand and color. I nicely asked about it, and she literally flipped out on me. I was stunned. Throughout my manicure, she continued to mumble under her breath and was really rough doing my nails. I know sometimes people have bad days but good grief. I felt like an idiot sitting in the chair. When I went to wash my hands the lady sitting near the stink getting her nails done remarked that she wouldn't leave a tip if she were me. I was just embarrassed. Literally felt like crying when I should have been able to relax and enjoy myself. Take my advice and stay far away from this place. There are many better nail salons in the area.",1
"We tried this new place, even though there was only one car in the parking lot during lunch hour. The waitress was super nice and took feedback well, and there was a lot of feedback from my husband about the food. We ordered chips and salsa the chips clearly came from the 99 cent store and the ""salsa "" was a little container of pink tomatoes and onions. my husband ordered a double Beam and Coke. Even though they had Jim Beam stuff everywhere, no Jim Beam yet. n nMy husband had the carne asada, which looked promising. A big pile of meat with several char grilled tortillas. Unfortunately they forgot to season the meat AT ALL and the tortillas were purchased at the same store as the chips. Maybe throwing in some onions and peppers would have helped. n nI had a salad standard salad fare and mac and cheese bites that we sampled at Costco last weekend although the sauce was delicious. n nSo, with the 9 drink double Captain and Coke lunch was 44. Way too pricey for food that was mediocre, at best. If the food was good, it would be well priced. n nAgain, can't rave enough about the server but the kitchen needs to get it together and maybe taste their own food.",1
"This place is HUGE! Apparently, it's one of the largest outdoor mall in the U.S. n nI've been coming here for many years and everytime I stop in I MUST check out FCUK, but it's closed down! So sad.

"My wife and I went to this place. We went to drive thru it took over 5 min just to place an order. When we got to the window the cashier looked like she just got a root canal and didn't want to be there. She told us to pull up into a parking space. We waited for 10 minutes for our food. And to make things worse no forks or napkins in the bag. I had to wait in line for 10 more min just to get them. I've been to this place in the mornings and it's not near as bad. Don't go to this place at night, if you do be prepared for lousy service.",1
"Excellent lunch specials and menu, definitely worth going to for a Thai fix. The decor inside makes you completely forget you're in a strip mall, which is a nice touch. It's very convenient to get to and has ample parking. n nThe dinner menu doesn't offer anything substantially different than lunch, other than prices, but the food and service is good enough to warrant a solid 4 stars. n nTheir noodle dishes are fantastic, the curry is pretty good but not anything to rave about. I'm a huge curry fan so I'll take a good curry over a great noodle dish.",2
"I was helped right away since I had an appointment to get my battery in my iPhone replaced. I even brought my laptop in because I thought I would be there for a while. Nope. I was there for about 20 30 minutes. The customer service was great, the turn around time was even better.",2
"Good sandwiches and soups, great cookies and a nice selection of drinks. n nWhen you look at other Yelp'ers reviews of Paradise Bakery, there is a noticeable drop off when they switch to the new menu. So far, they've resisted that change here! n nWhat Paradise does best, is to offer a good sandwich, half or whole and bowl of delicious soup. Whenever we come here it's our go to meal, that is . healthy. But that has never stopped us from turning our noses up to one of those soft and tasty chocolate chip cookies. Their Onion Soup is almost as good as the one found at Zinc Bistro, but without the melted Gruyere cheese. LOL Well, not really. But it's very good. n nEnjoy!",2

"4 star food and ambiance at lunch about a week ago ruined by 0 star service that you wouldn't find at Denny's. We sat outside and saw our waiter maybe 2 times during the 2 hours it took to serve 3 prix fix courses. He seemed inconvenienced by our existence.although he is drastically overpaid for the level of service he provides. n nFood runners would mutter as they delivered the dishes. It was inaudible as to what they were saying! I guess if your restaurant is doing well service goes out the window! My 12 year old nephew who has never had a job was pointing out how bad it was. First time i've under tipped in over 25 years. I really should have left no tip. n nAs a local I wont be back or recommend this place as I have many times for a long time, until I read the service is better. I don't care how good the food is.",1
"I called Roofing Consultants of Arizona for a chimney area leak. Gary called the next business day to schedule an appointment for the free estimate. He was friendly, professional and knowledgeable about the repairs that needed to be done. I was relieved to find out he wasn't pushy about doing extra work that didn't need to be done right now. Gary's estimate was in line with the other bids I got. I was sold on their long track record, high ratings on Yelp and their 2 ranking in the recent Phoenix Business Journal's report of best roofing companies. After I approved the bid, Ryan, the scheduler, called to get me in the que to get the repairs done as soon as possible. The roofer was professional and showed up on time. He completed the work quickly and it looks to me, a laymen, that the work is very high quality. RCA showed me they care when a field superintendent showed up shortly after the roofer started to check on the progress, give me his direct line with a business card, and make sure I had all of my questions answered. Wow, that was very impressive! My roof is near it's 30 year life so I'll definitely be calling Roofing Consultants of Arizona in a couple of years when it's time for a new roof. This company knows how to run a business with a high level of customer care. The estimate, scheduling, billing and craftsmanship were all very well done!",2
"This mall is definitely more upscale than the others in the Vegas Valley, but that doesn't mean it is better by any means. n nFirst and foremost, the selection of stores. The big problem here is that this place focuses on high end stores a lot more than other malls. As such, more basic stores you've come to love at other malls are not represented as well as you might like. Additionally, the mall contains no music video store. At least it has better stores than the outlets. n nOne of my big complaints about this mall is the confusing layout. It is a ""staggered "", two story layout that is extremely difficult to explain. You actually have to be in the mall to understand what I am talking about. n nThe food court on its OWN floor in addition to the others has a good selection of dining options, including some you don't typically see in malls including Wendy's and KFC , plus some separate dine in restaurants. However, the food court has high prices, even more so than other malls. This is most likely to cash in on the mall's strip location. For ONE person myself to eat at the Panda Express, it cost around 10, when I can eat for far less at any other one of their Vegas Valley locations. n nThere really just isn't any reason to go here. If you want a good clothing shopping experience, go to the outlets. If you want a traditional mall experience, go to the Galleria.",1

"Came in with my friend, her daughter and my daughter and their American Girl Dolls. It was one of the dolls birthday so off to get pampered. They are always patient with us when we just pop in and there is so much energy from the girls. The girls their nails and toe nails done in pink with puppy dog prints. I elected to take off my acrylic and just go oh' natural with purple. My friend went a light taupe color for her fingers and toe nails got some nail art done. The American Girl dolls just hung out enjoyed the massage chairs. I normally rate very high but my polish bubbled and doesn't look that great. Normally I go for the gel and those always looked great and lasted along time. I am not sure if it is the polish or what.

"I'm. Surprised. n nNever thought I would see a ramen place excel higher than monta. Well, this place is pretty damn close. Keep it up and I would say they finally raised the bar for ramen in this town! Their broth tonkatsu premium white is less salty, thick and creamy. It sits well in your stomach. It doesn't feel fattening, and is really light. When you eat it, it goes down so smooth and you don't feel humongous after you eat a bowl. You simply feel satisfied. n nGet the combos for more for your buck! Awesome prices. Chasu bowls are really good. The Jinya bun is suuuuper yummy I could eat those all day. n nThe atmosphere is awesome. Nice setting. Loud music. When you walk in they immediately greet you hello. When you walk out they immediately greet you goodbye. You feel like you're a famous someone, and that's an awesome feeling! The waitresses are super sweet! She even remembered me after just two visits. This place is definitely a hot spot. n nTheir girls bathroom is also pretty awesome. And I love the fact that they're open late til 3am. Finally don't have to rush for ramen because most of them close at 11am. n nKudos to you, Jinya.",2
"I love cities with public transportation, and I particularly love cities with subways since that means I won't have to drive to get around. Montreal is the city with the cleanest subway I've seen of late although Toronto probably beats it hands down I just haven't been to Toronto in the last 8 years . Montreal's subway cars are clean and well kept, they run on time, there is never a long wait, and I don't feel unsafe traveling the subway after dark. n nThe service to the metro area is well planned and I can get from one end of the city to the other in under an hour and more likely under 30 minutes including the walk to the destination. In a city of 4 million people that is as spread out as Montreal, this is key. The best thing I like about it? I see locals using it ALL THE TIME, so it's not just for tourists. n nThe only issues I have with Montreal's Metro? There are very few stops outside of the island of Montreal, meaning that there are places I can't see and things I can't do because the Metro doesn't run there. But I'll suck it up and deal with my disappointment, because Montreal's Metro is, hands down, the most well planned and executed subway I've traveled in a long time.",2

Best thing was I didn't have to hassle with setting any of it up myself, I just explained the kind of trip experience we wanted and Sheets took care of the rest, all we had to do was show up. I will definitely be using Sheets to plan all of my VIP needs in the future and have recommend him to all of my friends traveling to Vegas.",2

"Every Indian Restaurant in the valley starts with lot of promise and will go down with the time. Here is another one with same traits. When started everything is rosy and great attention to the detail and respect to the customers? As time goes on, they think they are pioneers of the business start showing attitude. We are there for the dinner, ordered Goat Biryani, the meat is not tender and my kid commented that meat is slippery and rubbery she is only four year old. You need to have strong teeth to eat. The chicken curry is actually smelly and it has some raw chicken feel to it. If they choose to ignore the signs it's sure will go down and history will repeat. n nI agree with other reviewer Rand H about Buffet comments. The chicken Biryani served in the buffet is pale not tasty at all. I completely agree about the styrofoam cups nothing upscale about it. Nan placed at the buffet is not warm, and service is OK. n nUnlike other Chutney restaurants in the country been to one in portland they don't offer any chutnies at the dinner table as a complimentary. I was excited to hear they are opening one in Tempe with the name chutney, but looks like it's an empty promise.",1
"This food has no flavor! n nSalsas were bland, not hot, not spicy. Menudo, bland no flavor, not spicy. I asked for hotter salsa to spice up the machaca and what was ""medium hot "" didn't have any more heat than the other two salsas that came with the chips. I have never had ""Mexican "" food so bland, dull and flavorless. And slow service. nYou really want the food to be better but it's not. nNot worth the wait for a table.",1

"All right, after a couple of years of sending my animals here, I have to say I have been disenchanted with this place. Let me tell you why n n1. Cost While I thought this place was expensive before, I really had no realization of HOW expensive this place really is. It is around 60 for the office visit, any blood work or testing is OUTRAGEOUSLY priced, and even the vaccinations have run much higher than I have ever paid in my life. In one year, I spent more than 2000 in testing, bloodwork, and medication for my dog who was diagnosed with Cushings Disease. n n2. No set vet Please don't get me wrong, I understand there are times when you have multiple vets an office and sometimes they need to cover for each other or consult each other. However, you have no set vet there, as far as I know. Any vet could be handling your animal. It really stinks when you have gotten attached to a particular vet and you can't always see or talk to that vet. I worry that this affects the quality of care than my animals get there. n n3. Boarding So, the last time I have ever boarded my dog was here, and the experience was bad enough that I will now never board my animal again. My dog had been the vet here and been prescribed medication by the vet for his Cushings disease. I left specific instructions on his medications and included more food than he would ever really need. All the food was given to him, more than he probably needed, and of course several doses of his medication were not given to him. He was there for 5 days. The manager of the kennel was understanding, and he did refund one day of boarding and the medication fees I paid. Well, considering each day of boarding is 25 which seems expensive for the care he got and I had already paid 125, this was better than nothing but still did not make up for this mistake, as my dog spent a miserable and restless time there. n n nI still appreciate that they participate in a lot of community events, and it is handy that you can do so much online there with the pet portal. They are great at sending you reminders of vaccinations due with plenty of time to get it taken care of. I am just not sure that I see the value in all of that compared to the high costs of care.",1
Be afraid!,1
"low quality and pretty expensive, dont go.",1
Great food! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the spice mustard is watered down.,2
"Here I go, my first review on Yelp. nLet me start of by saying that I have never bought any of the items from Aux Vivres but I have gladly munched on many items that my girlfriend has gotten from there. nAs a non vegan, I would not have paid the money for these items. But as of 11 35pm on a Tuesday night, I have officially changed my mind. Everything that I have eaten from this establishment has been superb! With the exception of the faux egg and bacon brunch plate. That one was a bit of a let down, rather bland if I may say so myself. But everything else has been so on point that I am thinking that perhaps I should try out vegan ism. I would like to throw out a big shout out to whomever came up with these delicious recipes. Especially the guy that came up with the vegan BLT and the chipotle brownie. I cannot express how satisfied I am with those two items. If i could, I would like to shake hands with the creators. n nBravo Aux Vivres, never did I think I would be writing this review. Hopefully you guys can sprout amazing locations like this throughout North America. But until then my allegiance lies to Montreal for the best Vegan food!",2

It was creepy and uncomfortable, I wanted to ask questions, but I wanted to leave more! This was like a dream come true.the store is very upscale, the products are well displayed its clean its neat, and the best part was the help I received.

She didnt push or prod, but asked some general questions and then began my education! I couldnt have imagined what a ""much younger' gal could share with me.but I came away with knowledge and appreciation. she was funny and made me feel very comfortable, like we were old friends. oh, and several new toys.

Needless to say, after hearing that, I did not have much of an appetite. I came back to the table and my spouse was also nauseous, and she didn't even get a chance to eat much. She barely made it back to the hotel room. She threw up all night long. I recommend you skip the buffet.",1

"FRESH! FRESH! FRESH! n nWe stumbled in at 1pm on a Sunday. The restaurant was not busy. We loved this unexpected gem and truly give it 5 stars based on fresh quality sushi and flavorful unique dishes. Our only 5 star rating since moving to Pittsburgh. n nQuality of sushi is excellent. Not only the fish, but the wrapping, rice, veggies inside are equally fresh. There sushi menu is limited, but if you are excellent at sushi, you don't need an extensive sushi menu. Try the Tamari Special is special and a must have! n nOther Items we had bulgogi and egg shrimp and grits were really exceptionally tasty. n nEnvironment is welcoming and someone took some effort with the design. The environment is better than OK, but nothing unique. The food though was that good that we still give it t stars!",2
The food was very bland and the chow mein was like wallpaper paste. This was more of a fast lunch place then a take out family meal place in my opinion. I gave it 2 stars as the service was prompt and so far I still have not found a Chinese Restaurant in Charlotte worth a repeat visit.,1

"This place is great. Terrific prices and everything and more you would expect from a Vienna beef hotdog joint. The owner and his wife a very sweet people, with a slight European accent but I have not asked what country they were originally from. I am sure it was one with a passion for sausage, guessing Austria. Anyway they do their dogs very well, great fries, everything comes with a side of your choice, cole slaw, potato salad, chips, fries, and more. Hot dogs are constructed just like they should be and have that authentic taste, unlike those other chain reasturants that claim to serve Vienna beef, those chain Chicago style eateries with amazing decor and piss poor food, you know the ones. This is an authentic unpretentious joint that deserves your business. Great to take the kids to and like I said the prices are very fair, a great high quality low cost lunch is what to expect.",2
"Another nice venue in downtown for a chill time. The crowd always goes wild for the singing bartenders. Although they appreciate the cheers, they also appreciate you tipping their jugs. Slip some bills down their shirts after one of their stunning performances. The music tends to be more old school rock and some pop. It is not just the bar staff who sings. Sometimes they have regulars that will grace the stage. Yesterday, one brought the house down with her rendition of ""I will always love you "". It was not a tacky way to pay tribute to the departed diva. n nI am not sure if sitting up front made it more difficult to understand some of the words, but there were a few songs where I could not figure out what Kenny was singing. Maybe the song was just before my time, but it was hard to distinguish at times unless I knew the song by heart. n nThe venue is small. It gets smokey quickly.",2
"Went there for lunch today. Wasn't that busy. It took forever to order out food, and it took even longer to get it. The service was so bad.

The service was that bad!",1
Um. where do I start? My husband went to the buffet where the food looked as though it had been sitting under the heat lamps for about three hours. I ordered the General Tso's chicken combo. The chicken was chewy and the sauce was hardly what you could call spicy. The fried rice had bits of hard chewy chicken ? in it and the egg roll was so greasy it was hardly edible. We ordered fried won tons and they were saturated in grease. I had heartburn before I even left the restaurant. Save yourself the indigestion and the money and go somewhere else.,1

I'm sorry but when you post a picture of white tender chicken and when you get bits of brown greasy chicken in front of you instead and it's not what it looks like in the photo that's false advertisement. On top of that the food made me, my bf, and his mom sick about an hour later. Chicken was horrible, gyros not up to par, customer service was not good at all. Nightmare experience overall, what do you expect when you try and mix Philly's and gyros in one shot. Your doing too much.",1

"VIB, Very Important Baby nMy brother and his girlfriend recently had their baby shower. They signed up for the baby shower registry and customer service talked them into the VIB card. It was explained that anyone could come in and add money to the VIB card and that they would be able to use it to purchase any item in the store. The liked the idea of only having one 1 gift card that anyone could add money, making it easier when they went shopping. nHowever, when they went in to use the card they were informed that they could only use it for diapers, wipes or formula. This is pretty ridiculous considering the diapers, wipes and formula are much more expensive at Babies R Us and normally they would purchase those things at other places. I'm specifically upset because I put money on the card, specifically so that they could buy a certain item from the store that I knew they wanted. However, now they are forced to use that money towards overpriced diapers or wipes. Any money that is put on a gift card VIB or otherwise should be allowed to spend the same as cash. I feel it's outrageous to force them to purchase certain items. Going forward I will be shopping elsewhere for any and all baby items. n nI've added an extra star, because after much complaining they decided to move the money over to a regular gift card that they are able to use to purchase any store item. Much better!",1
"Open your eyes wide when you look for this place because you will probably pass right by it! But This place is pretty darn good.

I made a mistake and ordered a 6 on my Thai Beef salad boy did I need extra water. I'm a big Thai beef salad fan I don't think they have the very good Thai beef salad. It needs a little less carrots and little more lettuce. n nThey, however, have one of the best Pad Thai in town! Order it as a level 1 it's perfect! The noodles are cooked very well not overly cooked where it's soggy and squishy. n nThe location is smack dap on Fremont street next to all the popular bars so it does get pretty busy at night the wait is pretty intense especially when you are drunk! Sometimes you can tip the guy in the front so he can let you in right away. Lol! But you didn't hear that from me!",2

But remove the pricing from your perception, and this buffet is just another pile of food you can get anywhere else. n nWe went Saturday at 6pm and the line was surprisingly short. The waitress was very friendly and the table was cleared often, until the end when we went for dessert and the dinner plates never left, even for the half hour we sat talking over coffee. But these things do not go into my rating, because I went there for the food, after seeing enough friends posts on Facebook that this place rules. n nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed. For this kind of money, I would rather go to Paris, Wynn, Bellagio, Mirage, or even Yama Sushi for AYCE. n nI was frustrated with the tapas style portions of food, because I don't want eight gnocci in a bowl of lamb sauce let me pick out one noodle to taste first and then I'll decide if I want a whole serving. I don't want a cup of fries to go with my fish n chips I just want a piece of fried fish. So many things I wanted just a taste, but were only served in portions that meant a table full of wasted food. Am I the only weirdo who walks around the buffet first gathering literally ONE BITE of things, and then I go back to get more of what I liked? n nWe finally figured out the key is to share the first round of bowls with the whole table, so everyone gets a taste and then goes to get what they liked for themselves. n nThe second frustration was that things kept running out. My friends would bring back dishes, I'd go up to get some, and they were gone. I never saw the prime rib, and the pork shoulder I got instead had five spice on it, which I loathe. The crab was served in open shells, which probably explains why it was so watery and void of flavor. The sushi was grocery store quality. The bone marrow tastes like something my grandma would scrape out of her cast iron skillet before doing dishes. It's funny how people run out of fancy ideas, so they circle back around to the garbage that used to be fit for peasants and leftovers, and they call it a triumph with a new price tag. Chopping a dozen cherry tomatoes in a bowl with a crust of bread is a sad version of cheap old bruschetta, and left me with a bowl of tomatoes to deal with when the bread ran out two bites in. n nThe best thing in the dessert area was the blood orange gelato, so sweet and tart. The red velvet cookies were also lovely. But there were no macaroons, my favorite thing on this planet, so I was super bummed the rumor turned out false. n nWe stuffed ourselves sick, and then enjoyed walking the Cosmo's hallways of beautiful art and people. It's such a great property, but the buffet falls short of those otherwise excellent standards.",1
"Dolce has been my go to place for spa services since I relocated to Scottsdale. However, this soon may change. n nThe first time I visited the Borgata location I was taken aback by the stylish decor of the two story spot equipped with a hair salon, nail salon, makeup boutique, and a variety of unique purses, jewelry, clothes, gifts, etc. The front desk staff was incredibly kind and helpful, immediately checking me in and showing me to the locker room to change, and then to the Relaxation Room to wait for my services to begin. They even bought me lunch from Blanco once they realized I was going to be there for a full day. After a 1 hour Organic Facial, 2 hour Swedish Massage with Aromatherapy and Hot Stones, Spa Pedicure and Manicure, Shampoo Conditioned Hairstyle, and full Makeup application I left feeling like a total Bitchin' Rockstar, ready to ravage the clubs in OldTown to celebrate my birthday. n nSince then, I have been in multiple times for different services massages, mani pedis, spray tanning. Each of those occasions I noticed that the quality of services stayed exceptional, while the customer service was not as great. Today, I had the worst experience with Dolce at the Borgata and I am considering not going back. n nAfter waiting for 30 minutes on hold, I finally scheduled my 90 min. Organic Facial and a 2 hour Swedish Massage. I was told to arrive early at 10 15 to check in and relax in the Relaxation Room, and my facial would start at 10 30. When asked if I wanted a complementary shampoo blowout and makeup touch up, I happily accepted and eagerly anticipated my long overdue day of pampering. When I arrived at 10 15, I was not greeted with a smile, a hello, a head nod, or a ""i'll be with you in a moment "". Instead the Client Coordinators were chatting among themselves with their backs turned toward the door, and as a client I was the one who had to get their attention. After one of the girls checked me in, she told me to take a seat and someone would be with me shortly, then continued to chat with her coworkers. After wandering around the store looking at hair products, makeup, skin care, and accessories I checked my phone and it was 10 35! Irritated, I interrupted the Client Coordinators' discussion notifying them that my appointment was supposed to start at 10 30, and asked if I could at least go back into the locker room to change. n nFinally, my esthetician Jordyn found me and brought me to back for my facial. Amazingly, she was courteous and friendly! A welcomed change from the other staff. Her analysis of my skin and choice of products was right on point, and along with a High Frequency breakout treatment and Eye treatment, I left the room with my face feeling like it was kissed by angels! n nNext, my 2 hour Swedish Massage with Josh. Best masseuse I have found so far! After reviewing my target areas, he started with a Fiji Coconut Oil Scalp Massage, and continued with my requested blend of Peppermint Eucalyptus Aromatherapy, Spot Deep Tissue treatment, and Hot Stones. Needless to say I left the session floating on Cloud 12, leaving all the stress and tension from my neck and shoulders, as well as pain in my lower back, in the room behind me. n nOn to my complementary shampoo styling with Elise, who did a fantastic job maintaining friendly and interesting conversation, and following through with my request for a voluminous blowout. Too bad I can't say the same about my complementary makeup touch up with Jewel. As a touch up, I didn't expect much, but the mineral powder applied was at least 2 or 3 shades darker than my skin tone. Topped off with a dark bronzer and a maroon lipstick gloss that reminded me of something my grandmother god rest her soul would have worn! Needless to say, when I returned to the locker room to change, I immediately had to do my own touch up to the touch up just so I wouldn't be humiliated while checking out and walking to my car. n nWhen checking out, I presented Client Coordinator Rachel with a Groupon worth 80 of services, along with the Fall Menu with Special prices listed, a hair styling product I wanted to purchase, and my Dolce Discount Bag. It took Rachel at least 15 minutes to calculate how much I needed to pay after looking at the regular menu and Fall menu multiple times. After returning back home, I looked at my receipt and realized that Rachel had only given me a 40 discount for my Groupon. I paid 40 dummy.it wouldn't be a Groupon if I only received 40 worth of services! I had to then return to the Spa to ask her for an explanation and for a refund for being overcharged. n nIt's sad that the Dolce brand is being jeopardized by Client Coordinator staff members who have no concept of customer service, or basic math skills for that matter, even though the facial, hair, massage, and nail professionals always meet or exceed my expectations. I sincerely hope management takes action ASAP!",1
"My husband and I always go to a fine steak houses everywhere when we travel so we are no strangers to high end steak. This was one of the most disappointing steak experiences we have had. n nService started out amazing super friendly server who explained everything. We were planning on getting a rib eye probably Nebraska and aged. The server told us that the American waygu is her favorite and the best in the menu. That being said we went with it. We ordered 2 extra ounces for my husband which made the steak around 130 for one steak. nBread tastes great, especially the pretzel roll but it was all cold. My husband and I found this odd. n nThe food came and unfortunately it was disappointing. The steak was sooooo wood charred tasting. It almost tasted like camp fire. It was not tender and was actually hard to cut. It was not very warm even. It lacked salt. It was, to put it plainly, a mediocre steak I could have bought from Costco and prepared at home. nThe Mac and cheese was some of the best I have ever had. The Brussels sprouts were good. n nHere is what really made this drop down from 3 to 2 stars. The server who was so attentive and friendly NEVER CAME BACK. Not one person asked how the steak was or we would have asked to have it warmed up a little. The assistants filled our water but never asked. We sat not touching our plates for at least 10 minutes when we were finished before anyone even came over to take the plates. It was truly disappointing. Finally once all was fine the server dropped dessert menus but never asked how it was. We wanted to get out of there and just handed her our card. The service and food lacked. If you want steak in Vegas do smith and Wollenskys or something else but don't waste your money on a 130 per person steak here.",1
"First and last time coming here. n nThe staff are very unhappy looking, rude, didn't even welcome us. A lot of people come here from watching the show Cake Boss, but we were very dissappointed. n nFood was not to our expectation, very bland taste and undercooked. n nLastly, the waiter we had asked us if he could KEEP the change. Instead of waiting for his tip. Very rude and disrespectful. We will not be coming here again.",1
"Red Rocks has it all. Locals. Cherry Lounge. UfC fights. Good Drinks. Nuff Said? I do not give Fives out much. Thanks Fertitta Bros.

"There is nothing else like the USNWC it's one of those unique places you just have to show off to your friends who are visiting from out of town. Now that it's getting warm outside there is no better time of year to make a visit. I've been to USNWC several times now I took the family here for a day of adventure we did it all zip line, whitewater rafting, kayaking, rock climbing etc. This place isn't just for family fun its a great place to host a team building event. Get on that rope course and kick your coworkers butts. n nI finally made it to River Jam last night if you haven't been I highly recommend it great beer, awesome food, and some killer music. Thursday nights throughout the summer you can go hear live bands and enjoy a healthy dinner all on the waterfront bring your kids, or bring your pups all are welcome here. n nI'm dying to go on one of the Microbrews tours this year a sunset paddle along the Catawba River followed by a fireside dinner with craft beer tastings. Now it doesn't get much better than that.",2
"To be honest, J N's is not my favorite. The BBQ is too salty and oversmoked for my taste. Service is good, and the place is very nice.",1
"After my initial review, I received a message from Graham the owner to asking me to call to to discuss what had happened. I didn't think much would come of the conversation but I called anyways as I thought it would be the polite thing to do. He claimed that he wanted to do something to make the horrible experience up to me. I suggested refunding the money I had paid as that is the only solution that would satisfy me. He refused. Doesn't seem to me that they wanted to resolve the issue at all. I would have been happy with even a partial refund. I am still out the money I spent on the Living Social deal and have nothing but a dent in my bank account to show for it. As stated in my previous review, save your money and STAY AWAY.",1
"Stopped in for some late night nachos and potato skins. The nachos are still awesome, the skins not bad. n nThe place was not crowded for a Friday night and not really that bad as far as smoke goes. It seemed like the people in there are regulars who hang out there often. n nIt was a pretty good mix even though it was light of men and women. The food continues to impress and worth the visit. It is nice to have a 24 7 place to grab some good food in a good atmosphere where you are taken care of and welcomed no matter if it's the first time, once in a while or a regular. n nA good spot for late night hanging.",2
"Policies? Hipsters don't have policies! nThis place drives me insane! The food is good, no question, but they have ""policies "" that you cannot substitute any of the ingredients in their crepes. nAt first we were told that they have a policy against that because they have such a limited supply of each ingredient that if they substituted anything then they'd run out of ingredients for the other crepes. n However, when my girlfriend and I wanted to switch some ingredients between the crepes we ordered so that the careful balance of the evidently finite universe of crepe ingredients would not be disturbed, we were then told that they have another policy that you can't switch ANY ingredients at all, even on the same order. WTF?!? I must have missed the Michelin Star rating and James Beard award hanging on the wall of your dilapidated strip mall crepe bar. My apologies to the chef! n nOh, and their coffee is awful.",1
"Incredible. Sauce was legit, and for those who like spicy, WOW. Crab was overpriced vs. other local places and service was mediocre. But the food, yummy.",2
"Always friendly staff who always help with anything. nSometimes late at night there are too long of lines though and they never open more. Tend to go by fast tho. nThe only thing that isn't the best are the other customers there, sometimes they can be really obnoxious and gross.",2
"One of the best nights ever. The Consol Energy Center was the perfect place to lose my hockey game virginity. I'm a big Penguins fan and they made sure I had a great time at this winning game! n nThe rink is clean, the stadium is beautiful. The big screen in the middle is fun and they make sure to keep the energy up all night long. Parking is a joke but that's always expected at these sort of venues. There's barely any way to avoid it. n nI didn't get an food or snacks but the nachos smelled super good and the cotton candy was only 5. Maybe next time. I love you Penguins!",2
"The burgers are typically good, service has been variable. n nUnfortunately, we decided to try one of their specials which was some nachos with steak ragout sauce and roasted jalapenos, with a chipotle sauce. Sounded amazing but as it came, it was just a big bowl of chips and barely any sauce. It just seemed so plain and the ragout was just a dark mush of sauce that seemed like it came from a can. Nothing about it was special and this cost 14. I asked the waitress for more sauce seeing that most of our chips were very bare, and later when the bill came, she had charged us for the additional sauce. When telling her we ordered more sauce because the chips barely had any, she said ""I'll take off the charge, Jesus Christ. "" She was definitely rude and hostile unnecessarily. If the kitchen messed up and didn't add enough sauce, you don't really need to charge the customer. n nEither way, Crane Alley isn't on my list of placed I'd check out again. I'd rather check out Farren's in Champaign. The recent service and food option was definitely not something I'd want to experience again. Thanks, but no thanks Crane.",1
"Four of us went to The Fiddler's Arm on a Monday night for dinner. Despite the restaurant being slow, the services was awful! Our drinks took forever as the bartender forgot them. The first two meals came out, and one was slightly cold. Being polite, we said nothing. After those two meals we almost half eaten we were still waiting for the two remaining meals. We went to the bar to find out where the meals were, and were ignored while the daft hostess talked on the phone with her friend. When she got off the phone, she walked away from us, got the two meals and delivered to our table. She acted like the meals had just been cooked, but they were in fact room temperature. Our guess was that she brought out the first two meals, but forgot about the later two. We will never go back!",1
"Jason and I used to go to this place for their. ahem. Bacon Donuts. Yup, I said it. Delicious chocolate or maple frosted raised donuts with either a whole strip or crumbled bacon pieces on it. They were heavenly. Equally as heavenly was the apple filled donuts they had the first time we came around. The service on our first visit was phenomenal, the girl at the counter was super helpful and not at all annoyed when we asked for a minute to look through the selections or asked questions. n nWhat the hell happened since then? The 2 times we've been back, no matter how early we seemed to get there I think most donut places should have all offerings at 8 9am still there are NO bacon donuts, and NO apple filled donuts. When we ask about them, all we get is this nasty attitude from the girls at the counter since. Like I should know better to ask about the apple filled when behind the sign that says ""apple filled "" has jelly donuts. Ugh! n nAnyway, I doubt we'd be back. We were thinking the service the second time was a fluke. Our mistake, clearly the good service we had the first time around and their bacon and apple filled donuts are all fluke occurrances.",1
"Horrible birthday experience! They called an hour before to confirm the reservation and left a message saying they would cancel if the call was not returned, I sat on hold for 10 minutes while waiting to confirm reservations. We were never told the entire party had to arrive before being seated nor that individuals would not be allowed to enter the restaurant after 9 30pm without having their name on a ""list "". Once seated the waiter got the drink order mixed up several times and told several members in our party that what they ordered for their meal was ""horrible "" and requested that we pick another item off the menu. After selecting a forth item off the menu I was disappointed in what I received. I will never spend a dime here again.",1
"This airport is only coveted for the destination that it leads its fliers too. the view of the Strip is the only thing that redeems this hotel. The tacky slot machines in the center of the terminal is one thing, but they dont even have a smoker's lounge its vegas for god's sake! There are not that many options for food at the airport. Also, it is a TINY airport with a lot of traffic and THE TRAFFIC LINE OF DOOM in itself is a catastrpohe. To its defense, you can drink while you are in line, which i saw many people doing.",1
"This place is absolutely amazing. I travelled to Pittsburgh for 4 months for work, eating out twice a day for the entire time. This is absolutely my favorite restaurant of all that I tried during that time. n nSuggestion The meat is really amazing, so I would suggest that you separate it from the bread in the sandwich. The bread is great by itself as well.",2
"Found in Red Rock Hotel Casino in Summerlin. Reasonable price for a decent buffet. It carries a pretty large selection. Also having a 2 4 1 coupon helps! Regular non players card dinner price is 18.99 when I visited a few weeks ago, if I remember. I believe the cost of this Feast buffet is slightly higher than their other Feasts at the other Station casinos in the chain.",2
"Maybe I just don't prefer my Mexican food deep fried and smothered in yellow cheese, but I was pretty disappointed in Jalapeno Inferno. n nI had a Google Offer, so we ordered a few house margaritas, the appetizer sampler, and the hatch chili pork enchiladas. The appetizer sampler looked like it guaranteed gastrointestinal issues, but we dug in anyways. There was just a dollop of guacamole that did not appear to be freshly made. The bean dip and quesadilla were both bland. The cheese dip was tasty, but it was the smallest item on the plate. The rest of it I believe were mini tamales, burros, and fundidos, but they all looked and tasted basically the same. To put it succinctly, all of it lacked pizzazz. If this represented the best of their appetizer menu, then I would not recommend any of the appetizers. n nThe hatch green chili enchiladas, on the other hand, were pretty tasty. Good, spicy sauce and succulent shredded pork. I pulled all the melted cheese off which came off in one perfectly congealed brick my enchilada, and I think that made me better appreciate the sauce. The rice and beans that went with the enchilada were fine. n nThe house margaritas were predominantly mix, so they were entirely run of the mill. n nWe sat on the patio, which was nice, except for the occasional wafting of cigarette smoke. I'm from Ohio. There you can't smoke in restaurants period, not even on their patios. I miss that. n nSpeaking of Ohio, the Mexican food at Jalapeno Inferno was basically like the Mexican food at average joints in the Midwest average and appealing to those with palates that crave the fried, bland, and unnecessarily cheesy. The hatch green chili dishes which I could never find in Toledo, Ohio were this place's saving grace. n nAll in all, not worth the drive to North North Scottsdale.",1
I went to this Salon because i needed my nails done that day for an event that evening i was surprised by. I did not have the option to go to my Salon as i live in East mesa. I almost did not allow them to do my nails as thier Salon was quite out of date and there was even a lady eating at one of the workstaions but i was in a bind. I paid 30.00 for a gel polish change that began to completely peel after only one week. Normaly mine last for several weeks. I called and the owner Tina Luu told me since i did not follow the rules she could not talk to me on the phone. I am not sure what rules i need to follow for my gell polish to last as long as it should. She refused to refund me and hung up on me. Please do not go here unless you want to pay way over proces for bad polish.,1
"This is a solid place to grab some quick, cheap Mexican food. The hubby and I stopped in the other day because someone had told me they have very authentic al pastor tacos. n nThey have two sizes for the tacos, 1.50 and 2.50. I recommend you go for the small ones, they are sufficient. The tacos al pastor were good, needed a bit more seasoning but their salsa verde more than made up for it. Hubby ordered the torta de asada which was REALLY good. The bread tasted like bread for a torta should taste like. All in all, we ordered about 6 tacos and the torta and it ended costing like 14 bucks. That is a tremendous deal in my book!",2
I was excited to try this place because of all the yelp reviews but according to the waitress there isn't any vegetarian options on the menu.WEIRD?,1
"Went here tonight Tuesday , got spicy tuna roll, rainbow roll, jalape u00f1o something, and salmon nigiri. We started with gyoza and seaweed salad. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about it was pretty crappy. The place smelled funky when we walked in but we read all the great reviews so we decided to stay.the atmosphere didn't bother me but it certainly didn't add anything to the experience either. Food came out pretty quickly but we were the only ones ordering when we got there. The salmon pieces were big, but not the freshest tasting and the seaweed salad was just average. Gyoza was mostly cabbage more like an egg roll and came with a cilantro dipping sauce that was thick and weird but if you like cilantro you might like it. Overall, we agreed that we'd never come back and we'd rather go to M sushi just up 59th.",1
Probably the worst haircut of my adult life. These people are nice but very slow and clearly not very skilled at their chosen profession. I say this knowing full well that I was going to get a cheap 13 haircut. Going here was a big mistake. They don't even clean their combs and clipper attachments between clients. Gross. Did I mention that going here was a big mistake? Go south to the one on Thomas and Scottsdale. They do a much better job.,1
"I'm at ASU this summer with about 600 other people who are part of a nationwide organization famous for placing teachers in poorly performing school districts. 30 ish of us decided to check this place out, and let me break down our experience for you. n nWe walked in, and the DJ was playing songs that few people knew or felt like dancing to. One person was dancing, and it was a gentleman in his 50s or 60s that we thought must work for the bar. One of the girls in our group asked the DJ to play ""Wobble, "" since the Wobble has become the activity that our organization does to unwind after a hard day or week. The DJ told her he was ""too cool "" to play it, and when she told him that was a hipster thing to say, he called her the B word. n nThe group that I came with ended up forming a dance circle in the middle of the club, which succeeded in getting people outside of our group to dance. Without our help, I feel pretty confident that the older gentleman would still have been the only one dancing all night. At 11 30 on a Saturday, other people should be on the dance floor. n nLater in the evening, after the DJ played Daft Punk's ""One More Time, "" I went up to him to follow up. Our conversation went as follows n nMe ""I heard you're 'too cool' to play the Wobble, "" I said. nDJ ""That's right. "" n ""But you'll play 'One More Time,' which is easily Daft Punk's most mainstream song. "" n ""Yes. If you think the wobble is comparable to any Daft Punk song, you're delusional. "" n ""I love Daft Punk. I just don't understand your logic. What are you playing next. "" nDJ points to his screen. It's ""Scream and Shout "" by Will.I.Am. and Britney Spears. n ""You think this song is better than the Wobble? "" I say. n ""Yeah. This song has substance. "" nI frown at him. ""The Wobble was a hit, "" I say. n ""No it wasn't. "" n ""It was! "" n ""Never on the radio. "" n ""Yes, it was. "" n ""No. I work for the radio. I work for CBS. It never made national rotation. "" this, I must interrupt, is BS. ""Wobble "" hit the Billboard Top 100. So yes, it did make 'national rotation.' n ""So that's your basis? Songs that made national rotation? No songs that were hip hop R B hits? "" n ""No. Now I'm tired of this stupid argument, and you're being stupid, so leave. "" n nI did leave, and I brought my fellow teachers with me.

"We ended up at the airport with a few hours to kill, and wanted to have a decent meal at a sitdown restaurant, versus a fast paced sandwich shop. We were in the C Terminal, and Zinc looked like the best option. The menu was pricey, but that wasn't completely surprising being in an airport and our expectations of the food quality. Unfortunately, we were wrong. n nThe French onion soup was a good version, but for 14 it needed to be better than just good. And that was the highlight of the meal. The steak frites were a complete let down. It consisted of a flat iron steak, served medium rare. I guess you have to pay extra for flavor, because it had none. And the steak itself was so tough and full of fat that it was difficult to chew. The frites were basically frozen shoestring fries, loaded up with some kind of red seasoning that was also flavorless. The only thing that made the food passable was an orange sauce that accompanied the steak. I'm not quite sure what it was, and it wasn't that great, but it was the most flavorful component of the entire meal. n nI would go one star based on the food alone, but the service was good and it was one of the only places in the terminal where you could sit back and relax, and not feel rushed. Just plan on eating somewhere else first, and maybe hitting Zinc for a couple of cocktails and skipping the food.",1
"Let me start by saying that my co worker and I went in last week and had a different server. Young kid, probably out of college and although he was a little slow getting started, he made up for it and provided good service. With a little more time and training, he could be excellent. We did notice that the dining area consisted of me, my co worker and another patron sitting at another table yet we sat next to a dirty table for over half our meal. It took four people and numerous trips to clear a four person table. Not the most horrible thing in the world but still, not very professional. n nThen there was today. Fail. Royally. n nWe went back today. How was our meal? I wouldn't know since it was over before it began. Last week and again this week, no hostess to greet you at the door so you're standing around looking like you're waiting for the 3 45pm bus to Nowheresville. She finally shows up like she just came back from cheerleading practice and seats us in the dining room. There is no one else in there and there are two tables outside being served total of 4 people outside . A gentleman joins the dining area about 5 7 minutes after we arrive and he tells the hostess that he would like some ice water and she runs and fetches it for him. Ummmm, it's hot outside. .I sure would like a drink of something.Where's our waiter? Then she winds up taking his order. Hello? Ma'am? Bueller? Bueller? Anyone?!?!?!? So he's got a beverage and his order placed and we don't have anything?!? Two more minutes of waiting and it was over. We left and I looked right in the face of the guy at the register who said absolutely nothing as we passed. I wonder how long it took for anyone to even realize that we were gone.

"I am a current YMCA member with a family membership and metro pass. n nThe worst, terrible experience. I got injured taking swim lessons there and the entire staff couldn't care less and only covered for each other rather than doing the right thing and admitting they and especially, the swim instructor, Amanda, were at fault. They were inexperienced and rude. That is not the Christian way nor is it professional. Please be careful, especially with these swim instructors. Amanda is not even a good swimmer. She taught the course fully dressed and not in the pool. How do you teach a swim course like that? She is very naive and unprofessional. Buyer beware. I have kids and would be afraid if they were being taught by this group. Morgan or Amanda did not even apologize, rather they tried to ignore me or help in any way. Very pathetic service and for this place to be advertising swim lessons is appalling. n nI am a member and have children as members. This is an honest review based on my experience.",1

"The ambiance and lay out are really nice, gives you a nice view of the water show at bellagio. Our host gave us a tour of the kitchen which was awesome. nThe food was to die for! nwe had the bacon wrapped dates, pizzette, cheese and olives, the lemon spaghetti all were so delicious!",2
"Went there last year after watching the Suns game. Terrible food. Terrible service. Really cool inside, they have some awesome stuff. Its clean and the musician was bada . But I ordered a burger well done with no pink. It came out so pink it was almost bloody. I complained and the waiter was arguing with me that its still good. I reminded him the customer is always right. He returned with a new burger just as bad. Also only had 1 refill the whole time I was there.",1
"I come here all the time. And i highly recommend this place if you want to have a light, healthy lunch and catch up with friends on things. The soups are always good here!",2
"I hate giving bad reviews to a place I have only been to one but The doctor tran is a total ass. He was rushing and even charged my dad just to tell him, ""there is nothing I can do. "" After that it was my turn, oh boy was he just down right rude! He is one of those people who is just quick with their mouth, makes smart ass comments, and probably doesn't think before he speaks. If it wasn't for the rest of the staff, quick service now I see why it was quick, the doctor probably rushed everyone else out like us , and amazing pharmacist I would have given it 0 stars if possible. I've heard great things about this clinic itself but hopefully I will get a different doctor next time. Overall the rest of the staff and pharmacist were amazing.",1
"Amazing, healthy food. Fun atmosphere.",2
"If any restaurant were to rate a 0, it would be Someburros. Between slow service and not being able to make a custom order, the white girls that run and manage this restaurant need to take a lesson from some Hispanic folk who run a home owned operation. n nOn arriving at the Someburros location in Tempe, 4 00 PM on Sunday afternoon, I observed about 1 3 of the tables had someone sitting there.all eating or waiting. There was one person at the counter schmoozing with one of the order chickies.not placing an order, just speaking to her in a quietly nasty nasal voice. The other chickie was bouncing between the drive thru and the phone, while first girl flirted obliviously. n nI stood at the register for 2 minutes before chickie who was flirting realized I was ready to order. She meandered over and asked what I wanted, for here or to go. Being on the guacamole burrito quest, I let her know I wanted to order a custom burrito, specifically that contained guacamole, bacon, cheese, sour cream and raw onion. 4 04 PM I have a receipt for the order. n nChickie created a 'burro' that was a Bacon Egg Burro 3.85 with no potatoes, no egg, add guacamole 1.35 , add Sour Cream .96 and onion .15 for a total after tax of 6.89. Chickie asked me if I wanted salsa and marked my receipt. n nI moved back to a position in proximity to the delivery station. Orders older than mine moved out through the line. Several large orders made their way out and folks received them to carry home. 4 16, I am called.I picked up my order and headed out to pick up the Valley Metro Limo. n nOnce at home, I opened up the burrito I received based on my order. This was a 10 "" tortilla with cheese, sour cream and raw onion. The meat I received had no visual resemblance to bacon. It is a most unusual preparation of meat. There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham. There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon.just hard to know what it is I am eating. n nMost glaringly absent guacamole. I picked up my receipt and called the restaruant. Michelle answered and asked immediately if she could put me on hold. I asked how long she expected it to be and only heard a click in reply. 2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and asked if I could hold. I asked if I had to and she replied ""Yes "" before making the phone click again by putting me on hold. 2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and told me to ""Please hold "" and pushed the button before I could reply. n nWhen Michelle picked up for the 4th time, I cut her off before she could say ""Please Hold "" again by asking if the manager was available. She said she was, laid the phone down without putting me on hold and went to get the manager. Next, white girl Sara picked up the phone and asked how she could help me. I shared that I was in about 30 minutes prior and ordered a custom burrito. She said she remembered, and called me by name. I told her the burrito had no guacamole and she asked me if I could return to the restaurant so she could give me the guacamole. n nI advised I was riding the bus and the next round would not be available for over an hour. She told me to hold onto the receipt, write her name on it, and next time I was by, she would give me a portion of guacamole. I asked if the restaurant was busy and she replied that it was steady. ""Is it reasonable, then, for me to have waited 6 minutes and been put on hold 3 times? "" Sara said that the girl running the phones may have been a bit overwhelmed and that it would not happen again. n nI am certain it will not happen again as I highly doubt I will waste my time returning to a hispanic restaurant run by white girls.",1
One of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stepped foot in. I didn't actually stay here.I just visted a few hours to check out the shops. What can you say? This place is amazing. It's like an old fashioned Italian district inside. With the celings that look like the sky and the little river with the gondolas going through. I loved all the renaissance style shops here too.,2
"I was desperate to find a nail salon to do both my nails and eyebrows, I had company coming over the next day from out of state and didn't want to look unflattering. My regular nail and eyebrow tech wasn't working so I decided to give i Nails a try. n nThey have a lovely shop but that alone doesn't make up for their bad work. I decided to go with a gel manicure which looked bad by the time I was done, I didn't want to complain though since there was already another customer complaining. They used 3 coats on my gel nails, it looked sloppy and you could see the strokes from the brush in the polish and on top of that there were little pieces of fuzz sticking to it and that are still stuck there since they didn't clean it off. n nOn to the next service. My eyebrows looked horrible, they took too much off, way more than I'm used to, to top it off the eyebrow tech said next time I needed to come back in with bushy eyebrows because she couldn't really work with them and I hadn't waxed or plucked them in over a month, she had plenty to work with. I've never had this problem with my regular tech or any other eyebrow tech, she also gave them a completely different shape. When I got home there were a lot of little hairs that she didn't take off, she only waxed them but didn't clean them up. My eyebrows looked like a hot mess. n nI won't be coming back at all, I'd rather wait an extra day or have a long wait time at the mall just to make sure I'm with someone who does great work. I'm truly disappointed with this place.",1
"The food is always fresh and made to order at Med Fresh. The portion sizes are huge which they should be since the prices are a little high. But they pile it on I like the Mixed Grill which includes chicken and some other meat, humus, pita bread, small salad, and rice. This plate usually lasts me for 2 meals but today I was exceptionally hungry and I ate it all gone. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean.",2
"Fourth visit and fourth time they get my order wrong. I can't wait to use up this gift card. Expressso seems so weak, almost watered down. Light ice here must mean 3 4 cup filled. I'm about to give this gift card away. One star for at least the server smiles and apologizes for the numerous mistakes they make",1
"I've been to this place 3 times and it is amazing. Super tasty street food that is priced right. I've never had Venezualan food before, but on my third visit we talked to two venezualan guys who said that the food was very authentic. We've tried the chicken and cheese, the pork butt and the garlic shrimp. All of which were fresh and extremely flavorful. The soursop juice is also quite tasty! It's a great little local place, I'll definitely be back!",2
Great ice cream! Probably one of the best in Montreal. They are only open during the summer and serve only ten flavors but they are all delicious,2
I have very little brow but somehow Ashu gave me an arch! The process wasn't very painful at all and super quick! She was very friendly and knowledgeable. I am so happy that I went. I will definitely be back.,2
"We shop at this grocery store approximately twice a week for the past 7 months and we have to say that their customer service is horrible when it comes to checking out. nThe managers are rude, discourteous. n We now shop at Lee Lee Grocery at Dobson and Warner who welcomes our business and rather drive out of our way to patronize a company that is nicer and knows how to run a business.",1
"My daughter was referred here to have an ingrown toenail removed. The doctor did a fine job, but I was disappointed in other aspects of this practice. The phone number on the web doesn't work must be an old one. The office building sits back off the road and is easy to find, and when I called to get landmarks, while trying to find it, the auto answering announcement came on saying that due to high call volume, all operators were busy. Luckily we found the building about 5 min. later. One other lady walked in the door just before us, but no one else in the lobby. No phones ringing off the hook, one receptionist actually ""receiving "" us, and another was surfing the www, looking at dresses! High call volume? Riiiight! Even though I told them that my daughter didn't swallow pills and needed a liquid antibiotic, they prescribed her 500mg horse capsules that I was supposed to get her to eat mixed in something. It smelled and tasted awful. They decided to extend the length of time she was on it, but didn't inform me. I found out from the school nurse who spoke to them about givng the meds at school. The culture came back, and they needed to change the antibiotic anyway. The assistant who called to tell me that they had called a new Rx in to the pharmacy said that she couldn't tell me what type of infection my daughter had. I told her to have the doctor call me back, but to give me about 30 min. to get home so that I could write it down. Of course that part of the message didn't get through because he called me 10 min. later while I was drivng and could take down the name of the infection. From what I could remember of the type of infection, when I googled it, I couldn't find anything, so I still don't know what it was, and have put in another call. When I asked him about the antibiotic, he had trouble telling me about it. Today, I called again, and requested that they send the records to the pediatrician, and was told that they had gotten ""lost "" because they send their dictations out of state for processing and had to send them again. I simply do not get a good feeling about practice!",1
"I used to like this place but enough is enough and never again. This is now the third time my chicken kebab was raw in the middle. Seriously if you are in a kitchen and can't cook chicken you really shouldn't be in a kitchen. n nI'm leaving the restaurant feeling hungry, ripped off and concerned I may develop some food born illness. So good bye Gyros Express its not you it's me I don't like uncooked chicken.",1
"Well we all know subway is bomb, but what makes the place is the customer service and this subway has the worst customer service of all subways. Because it is a 24 hour restaurant we had to ring the bell and wait to be buzzed in,we stood outside for about 15 min waiting for the employee to open the door after we were just inside of the store 2 minutes prior. Finally he let us in and seemed like he hated his job and we were an inconvenience, he took his time and didn't even really acknowledge we were there. I hate writing bad reviews but this really was not necessary. Not even one star rating.",1
"They're a family run business. . .and it shows. The owner is friendly and clearly dedicated to superior product. I dig their fudge, carmel corn and glass counter items. Ice Cream aok too.",2
"I was here over labor day weekend and am just now getting to writing my review. nMy mom and I enjoyed everything we ate. We starting with the flaming cheese and then shared lamb chops and stuffed chicken. Everything on the menu was well priced and good portions for sharing nThe staff were all very friendly, but at one point it seemed we had to many waiters and every 3 minutes a different one came by asking how we were. There were also some promo Absolute vodka ladies there giving away lemon drop samples and chapstick I like free stuff. nI would go back here, but it's getting busy so make a reservation.

"Sad, just plain sad. The salesperson was kind of rude. Nothing overt but far from friendly. I was shopping for a sport coat and they had zero in my size. Ok, I'm not tiny Tim but no 54s? I too was suckered in by the buy one get 3 free. Well, not if there is nothing that fits. Went to Men's wearhouse across the parking lot who had a huge selection to choose from and a friendly and helpful staff. Two coats being tailored now.",1
"Went and had the garlic chicken and it was all right. I would have preferred it to be more garlicky but it was not bad. The only thing that turned me off was that the prices are kind of expensive for the amount of food they give you. They put a small mound of rice under the meat portion to plump it up and make it look like you're getting a lot. Also personally, it turns me off from eating when employees have extremely large gauged ears and tattoos all up their necks and arms. Call me old school, but it is not what I want to see when dining.",1
"This is one of my favorite breakfast chains but every time I go to this location, the service lags terribly. I say its mainly due to the lack of servers for the amount of patrons they get in. Food is a 5 star but service is a 2.4 My favs are their omelets every one . It's like a souffl u00e9 ! Cant get it like that anywhere else. nAlso, their whip cream is probably the best! nI don't think I've had anything on the menu that was less than amazing. I definitely tolerate the slow service for the food. nI went there today and ordered their pumpkin pancakes and it came with the amazing whip cream. It's a seasonal special they serve and they do an amazing job! They do it better than at IHOP D",2
"I always enjoy my annual eye exam here. Overall, this is an excellent office with great Doctors and Staff. I always feel they take the time to see each patient and answer all my questions. It always has a very warm and inviting atmosphere, which is very important to me having been to other medical offices that were not welcoming at all.",2
"Crab cakes were very fishy.I would not have served them to customers. n nService was age regular biased, if you are under 50 and or you are not a regular, skip this place. n nI have been to sullivans, mortons, flemmings and ruth chris' all over the country.most ridiculous experience I have had at any of them over the past 15 years. n nNot sure how, but this franchise formula is broken at this location. n nDo yourself a favor, skip the drive to Middleton, and look elsewhere.",1
My husband is the one who uses this place but at times I stop by and pick something up for him. This location has a lot of choices and even give you the opportunity to call ahead and they will have it ready for you. There were 4 5 staff working and a storefront of ppl. They handled each customer with time and respect! We waited for a few minutes but then were in and out. Prices are reasonable as well!,2
"Overhyped. Overhyped. Overhyped. The food doesn't taste good and it comes out in huge portions. A big plate of non yummy food. I feel like breakfast made at home taste way better than this. Save your money. Do it yourself. n nMushroom burger meat was kind of dry, big burger. Also pricey but not tasty. Whyyyyy. n nBasic ham, over medium egg, crispy potatoes. This is a super basic dish and I picked this because everything else looked really intense and they still managed to serve me something that I can make better myself. n nSage fried chicken dried chicken, it also tasted kind of sweet. Gross. n nOriginal hash Benedict loads of food but also meh. The bacon tasted like pork rinds. n nBanana pancake this thing is huge! I would say this is the best tasting out of everything we ordered but they also forgot to put this in and it took forever to come out. We finished our food, paid for the bill, and waited an extra 15mins for this pancake. n nI won't be back.",1
"The best Italian food I've had in AZ. Closest to little Italy in NY. Appetizer was grilled pizza dough topped with fig jam, prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes, shaved Parmesan and drizzled with white truffle oil and balsamic glaze. Awesome! We had Malbec wine, the best eggplant parmesan with delicious tomato sauce. My husband had shrimp scampi also very good. For dessert a comp cannoli b day and imported peach sorbet served in a fresh peach. A go back for sure!",2
"Stumbled upon this place while in Vegas, wandering aimlessly through the casino. We thought ""hmmm.Bobby Flay? OK I guess we will check it out. "" n nAt the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for Bobby Flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason.his charm can get him only so far. Perhaps the man can cook. Plus, we were in the mood for mexican like food. n nLesson learned go with your first instinct. n nWe were there for brunch, and my date got a Mesa burger which was small but presented very nicely. The flavor was just OK and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty. Southwestern fries were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an OK complement to an OK burger. n nI ordered Sophie's chopped salad and asked the waiter to give me a quick run down of the veggies in it. However, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention. Because the olive flavor was so overpowering and i dislike olives , i had to send it back. My date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal. Check minus on service. n nI wouldn't be upset about the delay time in getting my meal had this been my fault.however when you put something like olives same goes for mushrooms or onions in a chopped salad and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors. He may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so I was a bit ticked and hungry . n nSide note the bread basket had some decent items. The blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit or miss on the ""heat "" factor depending on which you ate perhaps some were mild and others spicy? , and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency. Stick to those for your pre brunch calorie consumption. n nThe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails. I had a tequila Fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious. My date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he's had.don't know how helpful that is, though, as he's generally not a margarita guy. n nOverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great. I would say I expected more from Bobby Flay, but as I said above, he was just never really my style, so what I really expected was mediocre and it delivered just that. Expectations met.",1
"I moved from chicago and had been on a hunt for good italian food and was really happy to find this place! The grilled calamari appetizer was very fresh and for entree I got a delicious spaghetti with salmon and cream sauce. The salmon was very fresh too . Even though it was a cream sauce dish, it didnt feel super heavy which was nice.The service was good and you can tell it is a family run restaurant. Will be back!",2
"I have been with Sprint for around 10 years and have always received great customer service. until now. A few days ago my phone began shutting off after just a few minutes of use, even after being fully charged. nSo I brought it in to the 20th Street location and after uttering these words ""My phone keeps shutting off and I'm not sure its the batte. "" I was interrupted by the rep and told that I would have to leave my phone there for 24 hours while they ran diagnostics on it. Very inconvenient, but nothing else to do, so I agreed and was promptly hustled out the door. nI returned the next day and was informed that my phone was in perfect working order! No problems at all. Okaaaaay. So I start looking my phone over and noticed that they didn't even do a factory reset did they even run any tests at all? Then two minutes later lo and behold, my phone shuts down again in front of their eyes. After a few minutes of head scratching they changed the battery .the battery that they said was working perfectly just a few minutes before. and now it works again. nMy suggestion Go to the Sprint store at 890 N 54th St., Chandler, AZ 85226. A bit of drive, but worth an hour of useful time as opposed to 24 hours of incompetence.",1
"This store is now under new management, and the new store manager really took care of us. I am a fan, and the pizzas came out great. Thank you for caring!",2
"Mediocre takeout barbecue at full service prices. n nI don't know why I keep trying to eat yankee barbecue, because I have yet to find any that's very good. YinzBurgh's is okay tastes like it was done in an oven and finished with smoke, definitely not like authentic 'cue cooked at least ten hours over low hardwood heat. I'd have given 3 stars, but not at these prices. Really world class places like Arthur Bryant's, Sweatman's, and Lexington charge significantly less, and they have actual seating. Yes I know YinzBurgh has some seats, but not enough. If anyone else is there, you'll probably be s.o.l. on finding a place to sit down. BTW, I'm judging based on their pulled pork. I'm from the Carolinas, so that's what I go to for in 'cue can't comment on their brisket Texas or ribs Memphis . n nThe sauces are okay. The variety's nice, but none of the ones I tried were great. The sides are average, too, but the lack of pork in the collards is pretty noticeable. n nFor a pork fix, YinzBurgh will suffice, but anyone who knows good barbecue is going to be left wanting. Your best bet in the 'burgh is still to learn how to do a passable pork shoulder at home and bring back sauce from your next trip to the South .",1
"Came on a Monday night, including our table there are only 2 3 other tables. Variety is decent, a lot of different cut rolls, but half of them are some sort of variation with cream cheese. Many items from the photograph were no where to be found. It has potential, but due to lack of customer, foods are dry, not fresh and salty.",1
"Please think twice before you stay here.we booked our suite on the internet and thought we were getting a good rate, we checked in and stayed for a couple of nights then on check out we find out they raised our daily rates! Fortunately, we brought our confirmation which includes the rate with us.at first they were not going to adjust the rate until we asked for a manager then they made the adjustment! They told us the rate went up the day after we checked in.shady business practice! The place is out dated, the 2 hour reception Manager's Reception is over rated.the line is long with only one person pouring for all those people and they use cheap alcohol so you are sure to have a hang over the next day! The Breakfast is okay.don't expect to get an omelett. Oh yes, we were told we were getting a king bed and ended up with two queens. We will never go here again!",1

"We were just here over the weekend for a friend's birthday dinner. We had a large group, and everything was great. We decided to split dishes between couples, to make it easier, and I think each couple got around 4 5 dishes. Everything was delicious. The cocktails were super good too. Service was great. My fiance and I shared the seared tuna, which was good but we could have done without, the scallops, which were amazing, the asparagus and egg salad, also amazing, the prosciutto flat bread, and the filet mignon. The plates are small, but that was the perfect amount of food. Others in the group loved the flatbreads too, and the beat salad, bacon wrapped dates, sliders, and hamachi. Would definitely go back next time i'm in Vegas, and would love to try some of their wines.",2
"The food and atmosphere are great! Urban and chic. We went on a Sunday for brunch and had the scrambled eggs and the chocolate pancake. nHowever, what put a damper on the whole experience was the service. We waited for 20 min for our check after asking for it and our bill was incorrect. I was warned about SLOWWWWWWWW service in AZ. and now I have lived it.",1
I rescind my previous review. Whatever kinks with food and service existed when the Old Fashioned opened no longer exist. The walleye fish fry is the best in town. and so are the aforementioned cheese curds. You must take out of townies here.,2
"What's to say? I mean another classic example of overloaded wait staff on a football Sunday afternoon. Staff up people! The experience started out fine but ended horribly with us waiting for nearly 15 20 minutes just to cash out. In between the beginning and end of our stay we were bombarded with nearly warm beer and ghost like service. Oh well, I had high hopes and I'll probably give it another shot in time when the place isn't as crowded. n nPS. If you are a Redskins fan, this is your place! They have a whole room dedicted to you.",1
"I have been here a couple times over the past year and the quality of food and service has declined sharply. n nI hope they make improvements as the reviews are declining as well, but I will be reluctant to return. n nIf you do visit this location, the Hibachi Mongolian Grill is pretty good. Pick your ingredients and they'll cook it up however you like. So if its more cost effective that going to Genghis Khan or whatever then knock yourself out.",1
"Went Thursday Jan 16 2013 as it was buy 1, 1 free with players card. A hassle to get as when waited in line found out you had to print out a coupon! What's with that as they advertise 2 for 1 with players card but I guess they want to make you jump through hoops! While the selection variety is not overwhelming no fried chicken? the positives are friendly efficient staff, good salad bar selection, tender turkey didn't try the beef , peel eat shrimp, enough selection to entice you. Too bad there is no more wine or beer ad on available. Just average or below average but worth it if you get a discount.",1
"My bestfriend brought me and my boyfriend here when we went to visit her in vegas.shes always talking about how good this place was so we had to try it. n namongst the three of us we got 3lbs of crawfish mild hotness, 2lbs of shrimp, one order of calamari, and an order of cajun fries. we got the same sauce for the crawfish and shrimp, which was DEEEELICIOUS! honestly, i liked their sauce more than the boiling crab, and what's even better is that THERE'S NO 2 3 HOUR WAIT! unlike boiling crab, no matter what day of the week or what time of the day, there will ALWAYS be a wait. once we got into this restaurant, the waitress asked us how many and seated us within minutes. if you like garlic, this is the place to go, their sauce is thick and flavored with garlic, it was just perfect. n nif youre ever in vegas, you should definitely give this place a try.",2
"The place is beautiful. We had to take advantage of outdoor seating on one of the few under 100 days in July. There were only two of us, but the place looks like it could handle a football team coming thru. To sum it up great atmosphere, the beer was refreshing, and service was great. The food could use some creativity. But who am I to judge",2
"A really terrible bar, with 9 miller lites and lots of people waiting around for someplace better to be. n nWe sat at the bar and had a couple of beers as we waited for our gang to get together. the bar staff were friendly but they gave us a dog of a recommendation to go an eat somewhere.",1
It is finally open! n nI stumbled upon this gem while working in North Dakota and when I saw that one was going to reside by my work I was elated! I am a big fan of the pita! n nThey have lots of vegetarian options for those who aren't meat eaters and for those who are they won't be disappointed by the options available either. n nWhat impresses me the most about this place though is their ample selection of vegetable toppings and different types of sauces. n nThis place is definitely worth a visit!,2
"I was very excited about eating here, especially after seeing all the goodies in the bakery cases just like back east! n nWe went for a nice lunch on a Saturday. Our waitress was over stretched with all the tables. She was very nice but service was slow not her fault. The hot sandwich had to be returned because it was ice cold, the salad was runny, My matzo ball soup was very good, and so was everything else once it arrived. Everything took forever to get, including the check. She did take the salad off, but it took 20 minutes for her to return with the corrected check.over 2 hours later, lunch was over. n nWent to get some pastries from the bakery and stood at the register while they bakery girls stood talking and didn't acknowledge me. Tried a mini cannoli for 2.50. The shell was soggy, like it was made yesterday. A soggy shell is a major slip up. Thought the pastries were over priced. n nWil I try them again, probably, but not anytime soon. Was very disappointed.",1
"Love this pace! Fun, authentic, great atmosphere! I've been to Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany and it was such a great experience, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas managed to capture the same fun atmosphere and great tasting beer and food. Would definitely recommend.",2
Horrible customer service. Waitress was not friendly. Hostess was bothered when asked for an extra kids menu for my son to color on.,1
I had higher hopes of being true mexican pizza like i got growing up. I will say it was very cheap! I also love their marketing.,1
"Typically it's such a hassle going to any COR corporate owned retail mobile store the lines, the waiting, and then hopefully you get good service. n nBut I can honestly say that each time I've had to visit this location, the staff has been incredibly awesome, upbeat, and friendly with me! A big ""Thank You! "" for that! n nEven my last ordeal, I purchased a phone. but decided it wasn't for me. The manager I believe his name is Anthony was extremely understanding and accepting of the return. n nPlus I had Mike provide service when I initially purchased that phone he rocks! n nAll in all, a great experience here. the staff cares about their customers, they are down to earth, and friendly.",2
"Guess I forgot that I already thought this place sucked 2yrs ago. My friend had a 25 dining credit, so it ended up costing about 5 for 2ppl. With that in mind, yes it was totally worth it. Actually even for the 14 full price it was an ok deal since it includes soft drinks, dinner and dessert. n nI cant think of even one thing that stood out as good everything we tried was pretty mediocre, bordering on bad. Even the ice cream doesn't look like real ice cream anymore they seem to have switched to dairy dessert stuff. For people that work in casinos it's about the same quality level as employee dining that isn't a good thing n nYou're better off paying twice the amount for a better quality buffet on the strip. For reference, the Main Street buffet is much better than this.",1
"Good location, clean, and cheaper than Regal at Red Rock I quite like AMC Town Square based on my two visits and with ample parking, comfortable seats, and good sight lines plus matinee prices the only thing really missing here is an IMAX. Factor in the nearby shopping to help you kill time while waiting for a film, a few decent dining options, and some of the earliest showtimes in town and I'd say I'm a fan.",2
"Really Barros. I live 5 minutes away and it takes you an hour to deliver a large pizza, wings, and a 2 liter. Oh wait. You didnt deliver the 2 liter did you. It was nice that you were going to send another delivery guy out to bring it. Oh! He never showed up. Not that I'm pissed about the few bucks, but really? Your service and delivery suck!",1
"Couple things here. A the food is phenomenal. Creamed Corn is delish, the Filet was on point, Sea Bass bites were awesome. the Chopped Salad was one of the best salads I've EVER had interesting mix of veggies not typically found in chopped salad . I had a great dinner. However. n n B Service was. odd. Server rarely checked up on us. didn't explain any menu items, and would just do a plate drop but not introduce the dishes at all. it took a long time to get the meal out due to business demands, but even so, the server should at least check on us and keep us in the loop of the experience. Bussers and Food Runners were great. however, our guy Adam , could've done a better job to make us feel special. n nThe variety acts throughout the evening in the restaurant are a nice distraction to overall wait time. some really talented performers rotate throughout the evening to put on mini performances for restaurant goers. very cool concept!",2
Um. I was scolded by the bouncer here for trying to take a cell phone picture of my wife in front of a wall of shoes.,1
"Pasta had ZERO flavor. I was very disappointed. To be fair, the bruschetta was good.",1
"I must protest the rave reviews on here. The worst thing about this zoo is the price. In this depression yes, with a small d , why does 18 per adult make sense? I know you can get free tickets at the library, but have any of you ever actually tried to get tickets at the library? They're always out. This zoo nickel and dimes your pocket. If you want to pet the sting rays who wants to pet a sting ray? , the giraffes, if you require water or a wheelchair, they're ready with their sticky fingers. I feel sorry for the people who paid to feed the giraffes because I watched as they were hounded with instructions on what to do, where and how to do it and what not to do. It really stifles the enjoyment of feeding the giraffes. Wonder how the giraffes feel. I watched as a lady complained in front of a large crowd of people about the giraffe feeding price and the lady taking cash answered matter of factly that it's a non profit zoo. This is the phrase they've been taught to say. The woman walked away, likely feeling scorned. A small salad costs 8. A bottle of water is 3. Boat rides are 12 ea. Camel rides are 12. For a Polaroid of the camel ride, it's 5. n nIf you purchase a 75 membership, you can come back throughout the year and receive an overrated discount on feeding the giraffes and the tram ride and the carousel for a grand total of 1 2 a ride! To clarify, I DON'T have kids. Yes, I'm complaining about the cost of TWO adults. n nThe cashier at the entrance is a nasty woman named Eyvonne. She must have needed a Depends change and that would explain her CRAPPY attitude. The rest of the zoo is staffed by high brow teenagers. It's too bad the animal environment doesn't soften their attitude. n nThis is primarily a hot weather zoo. There are no penguins or polar bears here. A lot of cages are empty and you get disappointed. I've been here a few times and have yet to see the coyotes. On the ""Desert Trail "", they are true to the spirit of the desert, because there's no water fountains on it. n nThat said, I enjoy the World Wildlife Zoo on Olive Ave. much better and would gladly drive from Mesa to Waddell to go there. You'll actually feel like you're at a zoo at WWZ because they have a much wider range of animals.",1
"bombbbb ! aroscaldo is so good, and their ube cake and mango cake are always great for any occassions",2
Ordered to go. They forgot to put it in the dipping sauce as I have requested. The wings were okay. Not as good as I was hoping for. The fries were soggy. T I've had better food and service. Not coming back.,1
"The service was good and the decor is fun, but I'm not sure that makes up for where The Mad Greek falls short. n nI went early in the afternoon on a weekday and although I was one of maybe six other patrons in the restaurant at the time, the place smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I may not have even noticed this if it was in the evening as cigarette smoke is not uncommon in Las Vegas, however I found it odd that the restaurant was so large and empty yet the smoke was so strong. n nThe menu HUGE but it's very cluttered and thereby overwhelming. Most of the foods on the menu either lack a description or the description is very vague, so if you've never had Greek food before, this may not be the place to start. n nI ordered my food to go and the hostess who was very sweet even offered me a drink while I looked at the menu. The food didn't take long to come out and it was all packed in a plastic bag. n nWhen I got home with my food, I noticed the bag was wet. I opened it and saw that the tzatziki sauce I ordered was extremely watery the consistency was somewhere in betwen Italian salad dressing and ranch salad dressing and was spilling out of a styrofoam to go box. I found this to be very odd that they would pack a sauce dip in a standard to go box. It seems like common sense that it would spill out of it and should probably be packaged in some sort of plastic container with a lid. n nOverall, I'd say the food was decent. If I lived closer to it, I might stop in once a while to satisfy a craving for Greek food. But anything more than that is a stretch.",1

"Very first time here, and I like it. Just wanted to stop in for a little pick me up! nNice place, family owned, and I have to love and support that. n Free wifi which is very nice. The place smells great when you walk in like fresh coffee. nI got a Buffalo Chicken Wrap, T got Calm Chowder soup, Her favorite. nBoth were good, Coffee was great! nNice folks working here. A bit high priced, but so is Starbucks. nThe coolest thing about this place is they do a special every day. Monday a free shot, one of the days kids get a free smoothie. Something different every day. nT was really happy that they had Almond Milk. I like real cream, So I too was happy.",2
First the good. Libretto is in a great location. And they gave me a free slice of vegi pizza while I waited on my take out order. Which I thought was nice. I'm glad they did because even though the slice wasn't that great it ended up being the best thing I got. The whole wheat pasta w chicken was awful. The Pasta fagiole was worse. I really wanted to like this place but I have to say it was a bust. I ended up throwing most of it away which is something I never do ,1
"Ok, I'm seriously baffled by the negative reviews. I went there last week with my spouse and we had an AMAZING experience. And, I'm kind of an opinionated person. We had a great sales rep, Kenny, who helped us from the minute we called on the phone. We were able to get awesome terms on a new computer, 12 months same as cash, and it wasn't hiked up like other similar places. Plus, they report to the credit agencies so it will improve our credit. We've referred a few friends since last week and they have all had great experiences! Don't let the negativity get in your way, def give them a chance. Ask for Kenny.",2
The pupusas were gross and so were the waitresses with their rotten attitude. Never ever going back again.,1
"My friend has brought me here a couple times, only on Mondays for trivia. Team Trivia is quiet entertaining, I must say. It's free to play, which is a nice bonus.

"Very beautiful and lavish club! Both the Wynn Encore have two of the best clubs in Vegas. It's a must for any Vegas clubber to visit and experience the sin city night life. Xs sets the bar with most night clubs in Vegas and lives up to it's name. Only problem is drinks are expensive, and indoor is a little small with very little room to dance anywhere unless you got table service or are outside by the beautiful patio poolside. I was expecting a little more as far as the older rap music on a Saturday night. I would come back on another night and hope I experience dancing to a different DJ.",2

And you absolutely can not beat the price! So give them a try.you might just love it!",2
"As an avid Ross shopper, I am willing to try just about any store. This location isn't one of the better ones. They are large and have a lot of inventory, but the downside is that it's not particularly well kept or organized. There are always lots of things laying on the floor. I wasn't particularly impressed with the customer service either. I bought quite a few pieces of clothing as as the cashier was putting them in the bag she just balled each of the pieces up and stuff it in the bag.",1
"It's just sad, to be so excited to finally see a checkers and them to be so shitty. I ordered a big chicken club they assured me they had the right order and it wasn't. .when I called to see if i could get some kind of something back for my wrong meal and super cold food they pretty much told me go fuck myself. Don't waste your time here cause the bad customers service and horribly cold food will just piss you off. Smh hopefully the right person see this and I can get back my 26 we spent for something I would not eat in a zombie apocalypse.",1
"Although the menu is limited at Dolce, the food is very good. It is some of the more authentic Italian food in Charlotte. Unlike most places, they make their sauce and their dough from scratch. The sauce is not out of a can as it is at most Italian places in Charlotte. I had the mista salad which not only was very fresh, but could have been a small meal. I also had the sorrento pasta with shrimp and it was delicious. There were five in our party, and everyone enjoyed their meals. The service was also very good.",2

"Just finished a fan freaking tastic Christmas lunch from Rollin Smoke and wanted to recommend this place for catering! n nSince nothing says Merry Christmas like great BBQ, I knew I wanted to treat our office to some Rollin Smoke for Christmas. Best. Idea. Ever. Chef Tim hooked it up! Lunch was for 14 people, but I swear we got food for twice that! A huge thing of Kickin Beans, Coleslaw, barbequed chicken, ribs, pulled pork, sandwich rolls, sauce and . . . wait for it . . . mac n cheese. I hate mac n cheese. I'm serious. I hate it. Just want you to understand who you are dealing with here. So I never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I loved this mac n cheese! Had a little kick to it like most food here and was really good. I just hope my waistline can survive my obsession with this place! haha.",2
"One of the best places to get German food in Las Vegas. If you are craving schnitzel, then this is the place for you. I have tried both their Schnitzel Wiener Art and Jagerschnitzel. Both dishes are hearty and tasty. Their pretzels are great and I believe they bake them to order. I'm usually not a dessert person but their apple strudel is to die for. I heard from the bartender that the strudel is flown in from Germany. If you like polka music then this is the place for you because they hire live polka bands nightly.",2
"Coming here a few times I quickly learned that this is one of the smaller JImmy John and you should most likely pick up your food and eat somewhere else. The employees were mediocre and so was the sandwich. Not being able to eat pork made ordering a sub pretty hard. Their is a very small selection of only turkey subs, which I hate about the place. I feel that if they included more turkey subs, they would be able to have more business. The place also was pretty packed when I arrived so my friends and I could sit and eat their unless we wanted to wait their for another 20 minutes. Anyways I enojoy the subs their I just wish they had a larger selection of turkey subs and more seating for the customers.",1
"I have adopted several birds from AZ Exotic Bird Rescue, I purchase all my toys there and I purchase my bird food from them. I have worked with AZEBR for years. They have a wealth of knowledge and could not be more helpful. Curt and Tyler could not take better care of their birds and they are so helpful and kind to work with. I would encourage anyone looking for a bird or bird toys and food to go see them. The food is fresh and the prices are as good as going directly to the people who supply to most of phoenix I wont mention the name but I have shopped both places . The rescue is clean, they take every precaution be sure the birds we adopt are happy and healthy. I cannot say enough good about these guys. I am shocked to see a bad review and would have to chalk that up to a person having a bad day. They are the best. I am a customer for life.",2
"Negligent course! Balls from this course fly into the public roadway on Rampart with no netting or high fencing to prevent it. The manager Tony is rude. He'll tell you the damage is the liability of the golfers, but REFUSES to give any information on the golfer responsible for damages. It's only a matter of time before someone has an accident and is seriously hurt.",1
"Beautiful setting with good buffet food but the wait and host hostess staff were bad. When they were seating us they sat our party 2 others at the same time I overheard the first party say there were 10 of them the hostess said ""well I don't know nothin' about no party for 10, this is for 2, you guests be gettin' on my nerves today, "" and some other rant and rave nothing that was very pleasant or hostess like. Then we sat there for several minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order when I saw the waiter serving the table next to us I asked if we could have coffee juice, and after we got it we NEVER saw him again. Won't go back.",1
"The Camion Au Pied De Cochon was parked at Dorchester Square when I saw them. We ordered some fried pork rinds skin I guess dipped in a ranch flavour and some foie gras poutine. n nAt first I really liked the pork rinds as it tasted like greasy but saltier sour cream and onion rings. I always had a weakness for those when I was younger. However after a while, it got tired and too salty for my liking. n nAs for the foie gras poutine, I was not a fan of it at all. Too heavy and rich for me. I know that's the purpose of this restaurant, but I couldn't even have 4 5 bites. n nOn the bright side though, is that it was reasonably priced as both dishes were under 8.50. n nVerdict If you like greasy, salty food, you'll like it. If you don't and prefer your food a bit less adventurous, then I wouldn't recommend.",1
"Very tasty food! We only tried the poutine and the sliders from the appetizer menu! Both were two thumbs up, amazing! Very large beer menu as well best part was it was within walking distance of our hotel and a lot of other places!",2
"Didn't stay here, but spent a lot of time none the less. This is definitely the pool complex to see and be seen. However, MGM Grand just opened a new pool complex including 2 saltwater. Note to Vegas visitors, the pool scene is the nightclub of the day. The collection of restaurants is quite impressive. We ate at Burger Bar here which was fun and more reasonable than most. n nShark Reef attraction here is a amazing. Overall look and feel of the hotel was nice, although kind of nondescript. I would think it would be a good place to stay.",2
The worst pizza I have had in a long time. Service sucked even more than the pizza. Please please look somewhere else. For what we payed for 4 slices we could have had a entire pizza.,1

"So all of the insane options at Foodie Fest my boyfriend and I visited Dragon Grille on our second round of eats. nAnd trust me we RAVED about those tacos. nHe had the chicken teryaki and I had the brisket with the sweet hot type sauce.

Even my non foodie boyfriend has been grumbling for more since the event two weeks ago. Can't wait to see them at StrEats. nDefinitely a worth while stop!",2
this place is Special.it is no Shaved ICE place like Ive seen in the valley.its SHAVED yes but the way they explain how is nothing short of really smart and lots of ingenuity .here you don't have to worry about sticky messy syrup everywhere. and every bite has your flavor.its really impressive. n nwant to get your email.how about their free wifi.yes this is an indoor place so when its 120 your not melting outsidse trying to enjoy your treat n nthey have tvs art work you can purchase right off the wall and uno . books. dominos n nits a really hip place with great people to meet and talk to.I really enjoyred it and will be returning,2
"Overall this place hardly deserves one star. The late night menu choice was terrible. nService was terrible. nIn one of our orders club turkey sandwich had a BUG crawling in her plate. The manager was very nonchalant about a bug moving on the plate. nI would never come back nor would I recommend this place to anyone visiting in Vegas, especially speaking that there is plenty of places near by that has exceptional service.",1
I like the fast line and found the staff efficient but you will !NEVER! justify 0.57 ea. For Equal Sweetener. I am from NYC where rent is JUST AS HIGH if not HIGHER and the Starbucks there doesn't attemp this kind of a scam! What a great way to get a lousy ratings and lose customers!,1
"The marquee is an amazing night club, but they sure as heck don't know how to follow instruction when running a card 6k for a table . My friend that was buying a table asked them to run the card twice cause it had a 3k limit per charge. What do they do? They run it once of course, so natural the card got declined. Once a card is declined they can't run that card again even if they make a mistake. So I had to pull my plastic out and pay out. Oh and they let us believe we had the whole area to ourselves, but the moment we paid they told us, oh yeah you only have half this area. nSo overall great car, but sneaky workers though.",2
"Its huge, like shockingly overwhelmingly huge. Everything is also the same. 80's flower print. Spreading that puke over two stories doesn't make it any better.

"I went to see a movie here today and was surprised on how they fixed this theatre up and made it look very presentable. This theatre is a full service theatre therefore they have employees there to take your order on food and drinks and bring them to you. They pride themselves on ""immediate "" service. Myself and the people I was with ordered drinks and popcorn before the movie even started along with the people sitting next to me. Half way through the movie I still hadn't received my order so I complained to a person working there and they forgot my whole order, obviously I was pissed. The same thing happened to the people next to me. This theatre is not worth it if you are going to spend money and expect good service. I would not go back there, if your going to go to a theatre like this I recommend IPic which is nicer and has good service.",1

"Update they changed chefs. It is just a terribly average place now. Completely different recipes and no attention to detail. The place is now also disgustingly filthy.

Excellent.",1
"Went here just to see what it was about. nIt's gross. Don't go. nI thought the chocolate fountain was pretty cool until I saw a grubby kid just standing there sticking his finger in it over and over and over. Where his parents were, I don't know.",1
"I have heard about this place for years. This past weekend we decided to try it. It was obvious that if you are a regular, you are treated quite well. The servers knew the names of the customers and treated them like they were part of the family. Our server acted like we were from outer space. In fairness I did not see him interact with any other customers, so perhaps he was the issue. The food was good, but there are definitely better Mexican food places in town. Perhaps if this was our normal spot, or we had one of the other servers I would be inclined to try it again. But, it's not and they weren't so we'll probably stick with our usual places.",1
"This is the closest library to where I live but the selection inside is pretty dismal. It is a smaller library, so they have an even smaller selection of books. A while back this library seemed like it was going to close, so I signed a petition to keep it open. It must have worked, because it's still open and recently had some upgrades. Otherwise, it's an older brick building that's hidden away in a deteriorated neighborhood. I usually put the books I want on hold, so that when they arrive at the library I can go and pick them up in one swoop. I really like using the hold system online and feel like it's the easiest thing ever. I also like that they changed it recently, so now I can put 6 books on hold at a time instead of just 3. I'm also grateful they are open until 7pm some nights, so I can go after work.",2
Best place in town to get ink work done. nI wouldn't go anywhere else in the city. I've been here so many times now that they make me feel like family.

"The Good Book a suite early to snag an amazing deal for a Bachelor Bachelorette Party. We booked a 4 bed for 720 a night after taxes. It was absolutely enormous and could have slept 14 8 in actual beds . n nThe Bad The sofa pullouts aren't terrible but it would nice if you could rent nice roll always. n nThe Good The Porters were prompt, unloaded a ton of stuff from my car and were friendly. Be sure to tip well. n nThe Bad Our room had a narrow vent that is open to the outside hot air. It wouldn't close, and both my friend and I woke up with no voice in the morning. n nThe Good The rooms have a kitchen with stove, dishwasher and full size fridge with ice maker. though strangely no liquid dish soap. n nThe Bad Valet is 15 per day or you can hike to the mall self parking. I opted for valet. n nThe Good The pool area is nice, not huge but nice. And you can order food drinks. The cabanas only require a 250 food beverage minimum tax gratuity, and include Voss water and misters. They have no fee to rent them, so if you have at least 5 people it's a real bargain for a hot summer day. n nThe Bad Hilton has TERRIBLE customer service on the phone and a 72 hr cancellation policy. 4 reservations in total and I must have spent 2 hours on the phone. n nThe Good The hotel recently put in a Starbucks",2
"This place upset me. I read in past reviews that they ran out of cupcakes, but I didn't think it was a consistent thing. I bought a Groupon to get mini cupcakes for my boyfriends birthday this past weekend showed up early to grab them before the party and they had a sign saying they were out of cupcakes. Are you kidding? If the cupcakes are that popular, wouldn't you rather have an overabundance of cupcakes rather than always running out? I feel like it would be less costly to toss out some cupcakes, or give them away to the last customer in your building than to not bake enough and losing customers. Come on Gigi. Bad business move!",1
"My coworker and I kept noticing the long lines during lunch, so both of us thought ""place must be good "". We were both wrong. n nThe menu at face value looks awesome. I got the impression that it was a deli with fresh ingredients, airy bread overall quality food. n nWe ordered the chicken cordon bleu and the chicken grill sandwiches. Chip selection was awesome with a range for every taste. The sandwiches were, in a word, forgettable. n nMy breaded chicken cutlet was popped in the microwave before it was put on my sandwich, making the breading mushy and not appetizing whatsoever. Pair that with semi stale bread and the sandwich was a lost cause. I only ate half of it before throwing the rest away. With the sandwich, chips, and tea coming to 10 bucks and some change, you can say I was a little disappointed. n nLesson learned that you can get a much fresher, more appetizing sandwich somewhere like Panera, for less money.",1

"I'm always so appreciative that restaurants welcome us so warmly! n n I had no idea that IOS Greek Kitchen was open in Charlotte but it could be because I don't venture to the EpiCentre very often. n nWe donned our best Christmas attire because who doesn't love an excuse to dress up! n nThe bar at IOS was lovely and well stocked! The American Mules with ginger beer were a new favorite. We then stuffed ourselves silly on their Greek salad, bangin' hummus and lamb. n nReally their hummus is divine get you some! n nIf you you work uptown this would be my go to lunch spot fairly priced and fairly healthy with a nice outdoor area. n nMy date's favorite part was the s'more bar.

Date night! We sat at a choice table to enjoy the sunset. Always great food and drinks.,2
"I had such high hopes for this bakery when I moved into the neighborhood last year. I've made quite a few visits there and I think I will not be returning. n nFirst, the service. EVERY time I've gone, without fail, I have been put off by the service. There are usually 3 or 4 people behind the counter, just awkwardly STARING at you as you browse the baked goods. They either ignore you completely or try to rush you into choosing, either way I always leave feeling like my business inconvenienced and annoyed them. n nSecond, the food. Honestly, it's just not any good. At all. Cookies, bagels, muffins, pastries, bread.they are all pretty bad in quality and are WAY overpriced. I've gotten, and will continue to get, better quality products for way less at the Bashas bakery 2 doors down. n nToday was the last straw. The rather rude employees actually made comments to each other about another customer as soon as that person left the store. I couldn't even FINISH some of what we bought today which really says something. Never in my life have I ever left a sweet treat unfinished! And my loaf of ""fresh sourdough "" was stale and completely tasteless. I have no clue how they've been in business so long, or how they've gotten so many glowing reviews.",1

"I went there with a group of people and we shared numerous dishes. Everything was truly delicious. Their Asian slaw, viper roll, and spicy tuna rolls stood out. The miso soup was made from fish stock and just the perfect Base for kicking everything off. I think I would go back on their 'all you can eat' nights. The 30 cost seems pricy.but the quality if the food would make it worth it. n nService and atmosphere were above par. This restaurant is much needed in Madison.",2
"It figures it would take me 7 yrs before I go to the empty strip mall down the steet, right before I move out of the neighborhood to try this place. n nIT'S GOOD.

"Spent 5 days in the Phoenix area and somehow we ended up eating at Oregano's twice. I was impressed both times. Service was quick and pleasant. n nFirst trip I had the Zany Ziti with meatballs. I was not sure what I was getting into then it come to the table. It could have fed a small army. Served in a Bread Bowl jam packed with broken up Meat Balls mixed in with the Ziti and covered with Cheese. What more can I say the HEAVEN! I was only able to eat about a third of it. Made for a great lunch option the following day. n nThe second trip I was in a group of 11 people. We sat out side on the deck and enjoyed a combination of appetizers, pizza's, and finished it off with a Pizza Chocolate Chip Cookie WOW!",2
"I've driven past this place many times and I stopped in today for the first time. I really, really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't to be. n nHere's the good The building is quite large 3 floors and there are lots of interesting things to look at. The people working there are very friendly. Also, there may be some cool finds hidden among lots of crap. n nAnd the bad The entire place is in disarray. It's absolutely filthy and smells weird. Not musty, but weird. While there are several floors to browse, most of the stuff being sold is overpriced and or falling apart. The building itself is in shambles it's crumbling. Also, the parking situation definitely isn't optimal, as it's located along the river side of Ohio River Boulevard.",1
"Was strolling along Old Montreal and ran into this quaint little shop selling maple syrup in all varieties. The sales associate was super friendly and offered us numerous samples of syrups, spreads, and jellies. He was knowledgeable about the different types of maple and how best to use all their products. Before I left, I had to also try their Maple Delight ice cream, loaded with chucks of maple sugar in each bite! Ended up leaving the place wishing I had tried their donuts covered in maple though!",2
Left in complete disgust. Poor service and this location looks NOTHING like as described on the website. They did nothing to remodel and it still looks and smells like the rt o's that was here prior.,1
"Sorry dudes. I've always loved this place, and the last couple times I was not as stoked on the service and I wrote it off as maybe my host or server were having a bad day, but after today, I will say to all my clients, all the folks who come to get tattooed in my tattoo shop, and my good friends who own reputable tattoo shops to spread the word to NOT to go to Yama. n n I live on the Southwest side of town and there are many sushi places closer than Yama but I had pushed my brother to make the long drive to go to Yama. n nMy brother and I have gone to Yama quite a bit in the past, so we have our rolls we are familiar with. n nMy brother had gone in an hour and a half before closing and the chefs had made a joke to the hostess to tell them to leave. My brother had ordered for his girlfriend and he some rolls he is familiar with. He told me that he thought the first roll was spicy and it wasn't supposed to be, the next one was so spicy when he got home his mouth was still on fire. He told them that he felt as though they were making their rolls purposely spicy in order to punish them for coming in later in the evening . When he voiced his opinion to the manager and host that he was not being treated with respect, they had suddenly forgotten how to speak English. n nThey literally left a terrible taste in his mouth and a figurative one in mine. This single experience will influence my opinion, and those of my clients and many of the people I know, of how Yama treats their customers. Sorry guys, but in my line of work I can't afford to lack respect for anyone, no matter how lazy I am feeling. Word of mouth goes a long way, and with the platform that Yelp offers, word of mouth and reviews will greatly effect the business you will do in the future. I will guarantee you today, that it will effect it in a negative manner. n nRegards, nEric.",1
"Ennio is my BFF. I love him, I love his food, I love his jokes, I love his accent he makes me smile and laugh so hard. He has shared so many stories with me, and at times his food has given me a glimpse of where he's been and what he's about. n nMy absolute favourites are the eggplant parm and cannelloni. I've also tried the escargot, gnocchi, and Chez Ennio pasta, all of which were great but didn't hold my attention for as long as the eggplant parm and cannelloni did. I would still absolutely recommend them, though! n nThis place definitely has some charm to it it's cozy and feels like you're sitting in Ennio's living room while he prepares your meal and serves it to you. This is a one man show most nights, guys. So tolerate the slowness, go there and enjoy your evening, don't rush through it. Bring a bottle, or two or three, and enjoy the home style meal with good company.",2
"This was a really uncomfortable dinner mostly because it was my suggestion and everyone hated it. Everything my mother in law ordered was sold out. They refused to bring her anything to drink despite multiple requests. the list is endless. n nAt the end of the day, the food that was available was good but the ambiance and the service were lacking.",1
"Hot N Juicy Crawfish restaurant no. 2 is just as good as restaurant no. 1! I like this restaurant as it's much bigger and airier. The food is just as good as no. 1. I noticed that when you order the medium spicy sauce, it is medium and not screechingly hot and if it's mild, it does come mild. In other words, the sauce come as ordered. We ordered 3lbs of shrimps and it was so good, we ordered another lb of shrimp! Also, we ordered the catfish and cajun fries and some rice to sop up that wonderful sauce! n nWill be back!",2
"After the reviews I read, my family and I 5 total decided to stay here for a one nighter on our way to southern CA. Overall I was expecting to give this hotel 5 stars but come to find out that it is really only a 4 star place. I know, it's not the Wynn, Venetian, etc so I believe my expectations are realistic. Overall, it's a Holiday Inn Express. The staff was OK, the shuttle bus to the Strip was convenient, the rooms were clean and the bathrooms in pretty good shape. The breakfast in the morning was just OK, nothing to really rant and rave about but again, it's a Holiday Inn Express. The location was convenient so overall it's an above average place in my book but nothing out of the ordinary either.",2
"We had the worst service tonight! n ""Happy "" the managers name was SOOO rude. We had problem after problem all night and when we told him about it, he told us ""that we were rude ""? nNo way to treat a customer.great way to LOSE a customer.we won't be back!",1
"I've been to XS a few times now and have always had a good experience! I celebrated my birthday there this past weekend on a Friday night and we got there around 11 pm. We got bottle service and were told by the bouncer that we had to tip him 300 to get a table by the dance floor, or else we would get a cabana outside. We opted to save the 300 and got a cabana. The cabana was one of the closer ones to the dance floor, it was really big, and can seat up to 20 people. The girls not wanting bottle service were on a guest list and got in shortly after us along with one of the guys who got a pre paid ticket . One of the other guys waited in the regular line for almost 2 hours. Always a lot of Asian people.",2
"O.H.S.O. is working it. They've got a good selection of beers and that propagates Phoenix's beer revolution, and they're liberal with the samples, which is terrific. With the exception of the arepas, the menu is fairly standard pub fare. I don't recommend the arepas, though, or at least the tuna one. It just wasn't clicking. n nO.H.S.O.'s best aspect is ambiance. With warm colors and wood accents, it feels like a nice, friendly pub you can bring your kids to. Considering the other options for decent beer selections around central Phoenix, O.H.S.O. isn't perfect, but it might be the best short of a drive to Papago. n nAlso, Arizona's beer culture is picking up, but it is just not there yet. I appreciate O.H.S.O.'s dedication to local brewers, but they'd be better off reaching into California Oregon Colorado than hosting a bunch of mediocre Fretzky's taps. Or at least some of Four Peaks better stuff.",2

"I think this could be the lowest score I've given any hostel in Edinburgh. I booked in here for 3 nights and a further 3 nights the following week but ended up only staying 2 nights and cancelling the additional 3 nights I had booked. n nThe hostel is central being located right next to Waverley Station but the benefits end there. For one thing there is no kitchen at this hostel which is useless for those travelling on a budget. The hostel compels you to buy food at one of their adjoining eateries or buy take away food all of which is expensive for the long term traveller. n nOne shower room had piles of towels on the floor underneath the sinks to soak up water from leaking pipes. The dorms were dark and crowded. I had a guy released from jail sleeping next to me who admitted to having serious psychiatric problems. Clearly the hostel is offering accommodation to social services because it's unlikely he would have a credit card or passport for ID. n nOn the second night I booked in elsewhere due to the obvious security risk and came back for the third night when new guests were installed. I quickly cancelled the other 3 nights I had booked. Cleanliness was minimal also. n nI didn't get much chance to speak with the staff but those I did speak to were indifferent and at the adjoining bar I ordered a cappuccino which was barely warm and had no chocolate sprinkled on top, all for u00a32 after the supposed guest discount. n nAll I can say is avoid at all costs, I couldn't get away quick enough!",1
"A for pretty much everything for me, love living close to Defalcos",2
"Went in tonight for the Turkey dinner, and chicken fried steak. Chicken fried steak was ""soggy "", and tasted horrible. 2 Turkey dinners, and both dishes were served cold. The only thing somewhat edible, was the coleslaw, as it tastes fine when cold. To add to the experience, the Chicken Fired steak was served exactly how I asked it NOT to be, and the mashed potatoes for the 2 Turkey dinners never showed up. The waiter never refilled my Wife's drink, no checked to see if she needed a refill. I asked 3 different times for condiments for the sides, only to receive them after I asked the third time. The kitchen staff, and management are clearly over taxed on anything more than 10 occupancy. we couldn't count the number of people who were in line with complaints over their orders. I WILL NOT ever consider going to this place again.",1
Always consistent probably the best deal in downtown. Food always good and price wise you can't go wrong.,2
"The food was great, but the waitstaff needs some training. n nParty of four 2 women and 2 men, went there for brunch around 1 00 yesterday. I would guess there were only about 15 tables that had patrons seated at them throughout the restaurant both inside and outside . n nWe were seated outside, half of our party able to sit out of direct sunlight under the awning while the other half of us figured we'd just tolerate the sun. More on this in a minute. n nThe hostess handed us menus and started talking about how she might be our server or it might be someone else. She repeated it a few times, which was a little strange to me. This is supposed to be upscale dining, right? As a customer, I don't think I should be made privy to any processes or issues pertaining to which server's turn it is to take a table. Hand me my menu and whenever the staff figures it out, whoever can come introduce him or herself as our server. I can almost guarantee no customer is going to reply to a hostess serving them with ""What? You seated us! You can't POSSIBLY be our server too! This is an outrage! Let's leave right now! "" n nOur server was a little weird. At first I thought maybe she was on drugs she was friendly enough and smiled, but she had no enthusiasm and moved and spoke really slowly. Maybe it's her first serving job and she was really nervous, I don't know. n nWhen drinks were ordered, I ordered last and said ""I'm so thirsty, could I please have some water with ice? "" and she started telling me about their water filtration system and how it chilled the water and if she gave me ice it would be REALLY cold, would that be okay? Perhaps that's part of her job to make sure as a customer I understand that ice will make water colder ! , but it was really awkward and I had JUST said I'm very thirsty and was sitting in direct sunlight. I realize a glass of water is the last thing a server wants to bring a guest, but come on, if you're making it difficult for me to order a glass of ice water on a hot summer day, you need to examine your customer service skills. n nThe food RUNNER was excellent. She served the ladies first sorry, I'm a bit old school in my dining habits and offered to open the awning further so the entirety of our party was in the shade. The food runner did this. So, back to our seating expereince as we were being seated and trying to scooch the table out of the sun under the awning without disturbing other patrons and the HOSTESS was seating us, it never occurred to the hostess to open the awning further to make us more comfortable? By the way, it's a motorized awning, all the food runner did was push a button. n nI had the tofu scramble. It was wonderful. The potatoes were a little spicy for my liking, but I'm a wuss when it comes to spiciness. My fellow diners ordered the crab cakes, the burger, and one of the Father's Day brunch specials, which I believe was turkey. Everyone at the table was pleased with their food. n nAnd not to my surprise, our server didn't check back on us until 2 out of the 4 of us were done with our food, and then we waited a long time to get our bill, and waited a long time for her to come pick up the payment. n nSo, again, to sum up Good food, but for an upscale establishment, the wait staff falls short.",1
"Incredible seafood their selection of oysters is top notch , the cedar plank copper river salmon was TO DIE FOR, and the service is always impeccable. Our waiter was one of the most attentive I've ever had, as well as sweet and friendly, engaging us in conversation and offering great suggestions. Even the bus boy was incredibly polite and going out of his way to clean even the smallest items off of our table when we were done. The management is definitely doing the right thing here.",2

It's cafeteria food served on nice plates. They clearly stopped trying years ago. n nThe bar food and hand tossed pizza looked more promising I'd try that next time. n nWhen they ask if you want the dinner or bar side of the aisle, choose the bar.",1
"I'm not sure how two years have passed without this place appearing on the work lunch radar, but better late than never, I suppose. n nLocated in the O'Reilly Auto Parts strip mall just north of Arrowood on South Blvd, the Taqueria is as bright inside as it is uninspiring and, well, strip mall y on the outside. That brightness comes from the paint job on the booths and table chairs, representing all the particularly loud shades of the rainbow. Cynics could say it cheapens the look of the place but, c'mon, you're in a super affordable taco joint! Have fun with it. n nI will say, though, that one set of chairs has a giraffe and elephant painted on the back, and both of those animals stared at me the whole time I was eating. A little freaky because they're hanging out on the wrong continent and all. Also, a Mexican Star Search esque show was on the TV not my personal first or second choice, but it honestly enhanced the ""little neighborhood shop "" feel. n nI paid 6 for lunch, including my tip, and thought it was terrific. I had two tacos one chorizo and one spicy pork both with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Note, as they state on the menu, that those extra three toppings cost 0.50 per taco. I'm guessing if you get them without you just get lime and cilantro. For me, it was worth the try. n nBoth versions of the taco had meat had a fine chop consistency not ground, but still far smaller pieces than chopped BBQ pork shoulder, if that makes any sense. You get a choice of corn or flour tortillas, and I took the latter. They double up on the corn ones to prevent the always depressing breakage. n nBoth the chorizo and spicy pork had a great mix of spice and were both bright and savory. I probably could've had a third but the free, warm nacho chips were were a good way to start and finish the meal. n nThey provide three salsas, and the one served in the largest amount a carafe! offered the only disappointment for the meal. It had cilantro and garlic pieces in it, but this stuff tasted like straight tomato juice. Perhaps I was doing it wrong, but trying it straight was not good at all. I hope it was just a bad batch lacking flavor, but heed this warning to avoid applying the red salsa to your food before trying a small sample. n nMixing it with the other two options provided a good topping for both my chips and tacos. There was a green salsa far spicier than your common salsa verde and a burnt orange one that was a little smokey and spicy, though less of both than you'd expect from a chipotle salsa. n nIn all, I am happy to have found a place that has fast, friendly service, unpretentious decor, and a menu with enough variety to allow me to try something new and probably delicious for a dozen more visits. With 10 taco options, another 10 burritos, and a number of other plates I didn't take a lot of time to read for a lunch order, this place won't disappoint anyone in the mood for authentic Mexican food.",2
"If you're anything like me and avoid chain restaurants and fast food, then it is hard to find a good place to eat in this area. My husband and I LOVE this place and are so happy our friend took us there righ after we moved to the area. nThe soups are delicious, and we sometimes go there just for the soup. My personal favorites are the tomato basil and cream of mushroom. nI frequently order Nora's salad, which has mixed greens, mandarin orange slices, raspberries, chicken, candied walnuts, blue cheese, and a raspberry dressing. nThe portebello sandwich, wraps, and garden burgers are also very delicious. nThe only time we have been disappointed with the food is when we tried the margherita pizza. The crust wasn't anything to write home about, and it was very heavy on garlic. nThe staff is always very friendly and helpful. We love the brightly colored walls and decor. nI highly recommend this cafe for anyone looking for a good sandwich, salad, and or soup! nWe",2

"2 words not impressed. n nI called ahead to see if we could make a reservation for our party of 3 as we had show tickets and was informed that they do not take reservations for parties smaller than 8. I was assured however that we should have NO PROBLEM being seated promptly at 6PM on a Saturday evening. Our show was at 8PM so I figured a 2 hour window should have been ample. It's just pizza how hard can it be? Boy was I wrong. n nWell guess what? The restaurant was P.A.C.K.E.D. We waited 20 minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad for a Saturday evening at a popular spot but when the expectation was already set that it ""wouldn't be a problem "" to get seated, it was annoying. The hostesses were friendly and pleasant tho so it was hard to be outwardly annoyed. n nWe were finally seated inside and proceeded to wait some more for a server to come by and take our drink order. 10 minutes passed when I flagged down a busser to ask if we could get someone to take our drink order. A few short minutes later, our server arrived and so it began.the glare. The ""can't you see I'm very busy and you'll just have to wait "" glare. Sigh. Because we were seated in a smaller room, it was very noisy and our server REFUSED to speak louder to share with us the beers they had available. We aren't deaf.it was just loud. She wouldn't move closer to the person asking, she wouldn't speak louder, nothing. And then she walked away.and 10 minutes later, she passed by to inform us that the bartender was backed up and it would be a few more minutes but didn't stop long enough to take our appetizer or dinner order. Fortunately, the busser was VERY on top of keeping our water filled so at least we had SOMETHING to drink. Drinks finally came out and we had to ask her to take our appetizer order. Again the ""can't you see I'm busy "" glare. It was 30 minutes after seating that our appetizer finally came. We ordered the Burrata which is fresh mozzarella with proscuitto and toast. Although the mozzarella and proscuitto were delicious, the toast was burnt.visibly burnt. I'm not even sure why she put it in front of us that's how burnt it was. But, we couldn't send it back because no one ever came by to check on us. n nMore time passes and everyone in the room has received their appetizers, entrees, and have moved on to dessert except for us. We are still waiting for our entrees and are watching the clock. At 7 20, I flagged down our server who gave me the glare again to ask her if our pizzas were coming out soon as we had show tickets. Instead of ""I'm so sorry for the wait, let me check on that for you "" I received the ""I'd call you a bitch if I wouldn't get fired for it "" glare and this time the glare was accompanied by a lecture that there was a party in the Carriage House. I had NO idea what the Carriage House was or why a party there had any effect on our meals but our server had already huffed off before I could ask. So we googled. Turns out Carriage House is part of Cibo where they serve large parties. Good to know.would have been better to know back when we were getting seated about these delays but so be it. Our pizzas arrived at the table at 7 30 PM. We have now been at Cibo for 90 minutes. Our show was at Comerica and was starting at 8PM. We scarfed down that pizza as fast as we could and Ms. Glare left us the check at least when she dropped our pizzas. n nAfter all that waiting, rudeness, and more waiting, honestly? I've had better pizza at Picazzos. This pizza was thin looking but was doughy. The sausage on the Salsiccia was sparse at best. The Rustica wasn't cut properly so we were fighting with the proscuttio. Both were just ok. It was really very anti climatic. n nCibo was a major disappointment. Considering all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I am that much more disappointed that our experience was so dismal. I wish I could tell you our server's name. If she said it, we sure didn't hear her and I'm pretty sure she didn't say it. There are lots of other options downtown. You might consider not going to Cibo unless you go with a larger party because apparently that's the only way to get good service and properly prepared food.",1

"We came here the night before our marathon after looking at the reviews and then seeing they made fresh pasta. We were excited as we walked in. The place has a cool look and our server was nice. n nNegative 1 there was absolutely no hot tea selection and the server had no idea what tea they had. I usually never get tea but decided to this time. The tea was some cheap brand and was presented completely unorganized. n nNegative 2 the chop salad is not chopped and its more like a side salad on a large plate. nNegative 3 the beat salad was more of a greens salad with some sorry looking off colored beets on the side. The salad tasted like one big bite. n nNegative 4 the meat and cheese plate that says a selection of such is not so. We received to thin slices of salume and two thin slices of prosciutto. The cheese was cheese sticks and the majority of the plate was veggies. The artichokes were the best on the plate. n nNegative 5 the so called house made pasta is either not house made or the cooks in back do not know how to cook pasta. We got risotto with shrimp and the shrimp was so over cooked that is was inedible. Then we got the trio of pastas. Tasted like generic microwaved pasta. And was like mush. We didn't finish either plate. n nNegative 6 we didn't want to attempt dessert and i wanted it! n nThis place lacks any food luster. We were so disappointed and bummed. We couldn't figure out how we spent 90. I suggest, if you must go to just go to the bar. n nI gave them one star because of the artichokes and our water glasses were never empty. n nIn conclusion, this place is just not good.",1
Novelty candy is great but the toys are even better!,2
"I feel like the owner had a bet as to how much money they could steal from a customer that day. I was charged for services I didn't ask for, quoted on other products that were so outrageous I almost threw up. 400 to change 2 radiator hoses? seriously? I'm talking about 2 belts that can be purchased for less than 30. n nI was a long time customer that loved the service initially then found it to be more and more suspicious as time went buy. In the end you just knew you were getting ripped off, but it won't happen again. Go somewhere else.",1
"I hate to be critical, but really this restaurant needs to step it up. There are so many excellent urban pizzerias in the Phoenix area and this one fails in comparison. Our server was quite friendly and prompt, however it was hard to keep track of the service because we were so busy swatting flies off of our indoor table. We ordered what the server recommended and the pizzas arrived within five minutes. The flavors were bland and the crust was soggy and wet so much so that we did not finish our order and definitely did not take any leftovers home. We were looking forward to advertised interesting flavor combinations and pizza that would keep is coming back. Although the decor was trendy and the patio seems accommodating and cozy, we will not be returning.",1
Great club over the years but new guy at the front is a dick and won't let anyone in. Even with VIP and bottle service we payed for.,1
"A must do when you are in Vegas. Of course, you're gonna complain about the long line and the price to get up to the top, but I'm telling you it is worth the wait. I recommend going at night since the city is all lit up and it's worth taking a lot of pictures of it. Make sure you are in them though The only thing that can be kindy weird is the elevator. There can be only so many that can squeeze in there at a time and it can get a little edgy. I felt like I was on the Tower of Terror in Orlando again except I was standing up. What are you waiting for? Amuse toi bien!",2
This is our GO TO PLACE for Al Pastor Taco's. They also have some amazing Chicharrones. Incredible. We drive from Summerlin to this place just for the authentic taste.,2
closed five hours before closing time. lame. was really looking forward to trying it after work but i guess it'll have to wait.,1
"Let me start by saying I only take the time to review a restaurant if it's worth reviewing. That being said, Echo Rig, culinary wise, might just be in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Their downfall is 80 of the staff and service! n nI started going there a couple if months ago and my first experience was amazing! Since January I have been back AT LEAST 10 times and have been disappointed most of those times. I return because the food is THAT GOOD that is, IF I receive it, or if the kitchen staff cares to sear the meat right . nFirst time I went, it was during lunch. The server was casual but his recommendations were spot on. Lunch was delicious and server was helpful friendly. n nReturned several times after that a couple nights back to back . There are two evening hostesses that ALWAYS remember us, which makes us feel welcome. However the staff upstairs acted too busy or were overwhelmed with tables. Only a few times we were offered bread when we sat. Offered the cuts of the house only once since I've been there. Once they mixed the sparkling water with the still water. Found a hair in our soup and they did nothing but take it off the check, did not offer a replacement or an apology. One waiter made us feel bad about not ordering an alcoholic beverage. Waiters seem rushed or impatient. Management seems unconcerned. Complained to a manager who did absolutely nothing and appeared completely uninterested. n nWent for lunch once and, I kid you not, there were approximately 4 other tables there. Ordered the Portabello Fries YUM by the way had a view of the kitchen and watched as it sat for 30 min while I ate the rest of my meal, all the while the cooks, waitstaff and management walked past it many times without a single person commenting who's dish was sitting out under the warmer. Also asked for a coke, which didn't arrive. At the end of the meal fries STILL up in the warmer I was presented with a check that still had the fries and coke. Mind you there were only 4 other tables present. n nAlso have issues with getting my table bussed, usually plates pile up before someone comes and clears them. Also they'll take your silverware before you're even done. n nPositive notes food is amazing. Flat iron steak is my favorite and 9 out of 10 times it's seared right and cooked perfectly. Portabello fries are always a favorite, Carne Asada bone marrow delish. Love the grilled octopus but every so often it's tough. Black spaghetti used to be my favorite until they changed the scallops to mussels. Crispy bacon is decadent. Ultimate BLT was one of the first things I tried and nothing short of amazing but have had it since and it didn't quite measure up the bread seemed old . Decent wine selection, white sangria is tasty, cocktail selection is ok. They used to have a chaucuterie board that was really good but I no longer see on their menu. Downstairs has fresh squeezed juices that they should put at least on their lunch menu, I am always curious about them but never know what they have. Steaks are amazing, I have had several different cuts and all are tender and delicious they should be, they're a butchery! and prices are great, especially compared to a steak house on the strip. All their meats or all natural grass fed. n nHave been hesitant to return because of service, have returned solely because of the food, only 2 stars because of overall experience. This restaurant definitely deserves better.",1
" THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE HOTEL n nMy husband plays in the WSOP, and we didn't care for the outdated rooms at Rio, so we decided to try another Total Rewards Hotel. n nWe ended up being able to get a really good deal on some suites at Planet Hollywood because of our Total Rewards Card Level. We ended up with the Panorama Two Bedroom Suite which was good for my husband and I, and the other couple that was with us. n nThe suite was very large and very easily suited for a large amount of guests due to the large amount of seating. Tons of chairs, a big sofa, kitchen area w stools, etc. There's a jacuzzi in the middle of the suite, as well as two separate bathrooms and a bedroom with a king size bed. All rooms contain memorabilia from Hollywood movies. My room was a Sharon Stone room which had various memorabilia including mannequins with outfits from movies she was in. Not going to lie, in the middle of the night, those mannequins freaked me out. n nAnyways I'll let you know what I didn't like first n nOverall Cleanliness Right away the room didn't feel clean to me. I ran out and purchased Clorox Wipes and bottles of Lysol and drenched and wiped everything in that suite. I wiped off orange yellow residue from the kitchen area which grossed me out because I automatically assumed it was either A Alcohol or B Alcohol vomit. There were specks of nail polish on the bathroom counter and a smear of makeup on the mirror. Not to mention that wiping the nightstand revealed a black film. EW! Also one of the sofa chairs had suspicious stains all over it, and should have been cleaned or replaced. n nCONS n nDry Air Circulation Everyone that stayed at PH were waking up crazy congested every day. Several days I had dry blood in my nose. Whats up with the air in this place? Stayed at ARIA during my trip as well and didn't experience it. n nOld Bathroom Fixtures The sink knobs and faucets were all corroded with lime build up. Every one of them. The shower head was completely covered in build up as well as the floor drain and bidet. I was thoroughly grossed out. The shower head had poor water pressure. My friends room had a leaking toilet and when you turned their faucet on, the water smelled like sewage. n nDo Not Disturb Sign Bandit I had a do not disturb sign on my door every day and every day I had housekeeping barge in on me. Either there was a Do Not Disturb Bandit roaming the hallways every day taking signs off of everyones doors, or there's a serious shortage of Do Not Disturb signs. n nHousekeeping Half assed. Some days the bed wouldn't be made but I'd notice our towels were replaced and our toilet paper roll was changed. Or sometimes the garbage wouldn't be emptied, and so on and so forth. n nPoor Beds In my friends room, the bed was broken and they said it felt like they were sleeping on a box spring. If you sat on the edge of the bed with all of your weight, you'd tip the bed over. They eventually switched rooms, and unfortunately, they received another dud bed. My bed in the suite was luckily comfortable. n nPool The pool is great and all, but if you're planning on sleeping in, the pool is so loud in the morning, you won't be able to sleep through the DJ and the music. On the weekends, my friend was getting woken at 9 AM with Nelly Down Down Baby. n nPROS n nTo be honest, as far as the HOTEL ROOMS go, there are none except for the window view, which was only decent. As far as the hotel casino itself, I like the fact that it's near a Walgreens and has the Miracle Mile Shops and is walking distance to many of my favorite places Cosmo, ARIA and Paris are all next door . There are also decent food places in Planet Hollywood and the design of the casino isn't too bad. n nThe lack of cleanliness is what really turned me off of this place. I know all hotel rooms are dirty. I just don't need to see it. Especially 700 night rooms. Won't recommend to anyone. n nAlso, this casino attracts a really young, party crowd. If you're looking for something more sophisticated, look elsewhere.",1
"This place CLAIMS to be a ""punk rock "" bar . it's not what I'd consider a Punk bar . way to many rednecks . This is NOT a cool place . and the booking is God awful. Skip this place and head to the TT Roadhouse . Hell even the Rogue is better than this place.",1
" VETERAN'S DAY DINNER n nDecided to try out Chili's right after Applebee's on Vet's day. n nAgain my mentality on free food A corner has to be cut from somewhere to damage control not breaking even on the inventory. n nThe Chili's menu wasnt as robust as the Applebees, there was a burger, a salad, a taco, a pasta and a chicken dish. We didnt want to hit up Chili's originally because other then the burger everything was a chicken dish. n nCelebrating Vet's day and it's a free dinner so what the hell. n nOrdered the Chicken Margarita and WOW. nThe beans were delicious, seasoned to perfection. Normally i hate any kind of bean dish because i've been tormented with boiled beans with no flavor when i was younger but beans that get a seasoning treatment, superb. n nThe chicken itself didnt have a lasting flavor to it, you pretty much forgot what it's suppose to taste like after the first chew. But it was VERY tender. Cut with a fork tender and this is a piece of butterflied breast meat. n nAt the end we decided to order a chocolate lava cake dessert because we all drank water and the meals were free and none of us carried cash for the tip. n nThe dessert was about average. Cant say much about chocolate cake with ice cream on top that oozes chocolate out.",2
"Top notch I THINK NOT. I had the pulled pork and all it tasted like was some watered down Kraft BBQ sauce. The meat had no flavor. The sides I ordered were green beans and chili cheese fries. The green beans were just canned green beans in a watered down sauce of some smoked meat and bacon grease, not very tasty and as hot as they were probably just heated up in a microwave. The Chili cheese fries were just a blob of cheese wiz with some taste less chili thrown in and all this made the fries soggy. nThey have load music playing and football on the TV. he place is not very inviting. nIt is hard to believe they have been open for 1 year as the quality is bad and prices high. I will not be back again. nI ate there a few months back and just had a burger and it was just ok, kind of high priced at 10.",1
"Just went this past Saturday night. Beautiful club the decor that is , but not worth the time or money. Didn't have to wait as our group had a table so I can't comment on that. The first DJ was ok rocking the laptop to spin his iTunes , but the 2nd DJ was really good. Unfortunately we were over the ""scene "" by 1am and decided to leave. n nThings to note n nIf you're a 20 something girl who likes to dress like a skank this is the club for you. n nIf you're a 20 something guy who acts like a douche this is the club for you. n nIf you're a 40 something guy who likes to hit on 20 something skanky girls this is the club for you. n nIf you like to be able to move on the dance floor, walk to the bathroom, have class and don't want to wait 30 minutes for a drink this is NOT the club for you. n nThe club was filled with douch bags and skanks. One of the owners had reserved a table in the same area as our group and was a complete moron. He was a coked up idiot that kept bitching at us to move get out of the way. Hello when people are spending thousands of dollars at your club treat them with respect. No one is impressed that you have losers like Pauly Shore at your table. If you're going to have a party of 30 people then use a space that is more that 6'x4' in size.",1
"After reading fellow Yelpers praise this long time pizza making fixture in Henderson, I decided to give it a shot which is a big deal for me, because to cut down on cholesterol, I generally limit my pizza eating to a pie every two months. So, the pizza must be very good, or I will waste 1 6 of my annual allotment on an inferior product. And, that I do not ever want to do. So, you will never find me ordering pizza from a national chain. n nI was quite pleased with Enzo's pizza. The whole dining experience did not knock it out of the park, but I found the pizza I sampled by and large to be excellent. The interior of Enzo's is not really pretty, but it has functional, comfortable booths. My foursome ordered Garlic Knots first. The knots that arrived were hot and oily but contained very little taste of garlic. The dough was tasty, but I believe Garlic Knots should feature garlic. A small Iceberg Lettuce Dinner Salad, with Italian dressing, that included a few hard carrot chunks, cucumbers, and tomato slices, was tasty but fairly ordinary. n nNow it was time for the pizza! I did not scrimp on ingredients or size, ordering entirely for myself a 16 "", four topping Pizza Napolitana beauty. My choices of toppings this night were sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and cooked sliced tomatoes. The table groaned under the weight of this pie that somehow was fitted beside another all cheese 16 incher for our friends, and a third 16 "" pie that sported sausage, ham, and extra cheese for Diane. Besides their large pie, my friends also ordered Chicken Fingers. We were a serious group of diners, intent on eating! And, to my own shock, I ate three Garlic Knots and my whole 16 "" pizza in one sitting. There were no leftovers for me. n nAs for the pizza, the crust was perfect. It was thin but not too thin, and did not resemble the cracker bread variety found in Italy. The pizza slices were just saucy and cheesy enough unusual crumbly mild sausage tasted good and I found that the unusual looking disks of mild pepperoni got along famously with my taste buds. Pizza slices folded somewhat in the hand as is desirable. I didn't mind that more sausage congregated in the center of the pie, so that the tips of slices were denser in sausage than other parts I just moved some of the sausage over by hand. I was prepared for this, because one Yelp reviewer had said that a trademark of Mr. Enzo, who was the pizza maker this night, was unevenly spread toppings, and advised to just accept it. So, I did. The only thing a bit displeasing was that a few cooked tomato slices on my pizza were orange rather than red. n nYou would think that we ate enough. But we were not through yet! How is a meal complete without a fine dessert? And, Enzo's had them available in spades. Diane and I enjoyed a Manhattan merged Vanilla and Chocolate Ice Creams highlighted with chopped almonds and a cherry center, and dipped in a hard coating of dark chocolate, with some Chocolate Sauce ladled over that. C'mon! How could we pass this up? The sweet concoction was decadent and luscious, and its taste a contrast of excellent creamy ice creams and delicious flaking sections of hard chocolate melded together with superior Chocolate Sauce having the thickness of hot fudge. n nMy dining companions and I made this pizza night count!",2
"The epitome of a crap chain. Why did I get talked into going here? Because I am a tool. Crowded, loud, mediocre food, slow service, and on this particular occasion a strange man two tables down and across the aisle staring at me and not his dining companion, during the entire meal. I should have just yelled, ""watch my head spin "" and vomited there at the table.",1
I just finished a teriyaki chicken bowl from here and it was delious! Make sure to get it spicy which deliciousness. My friend got a chicken pesto sandwich and it looked amazing. I can't wait to come back and try more!,2
"Stopped in here today with Robyn N. for the Lunch Buffet. Things have slipped just slightly from the best it has been here, as the Mongolian BBQ which used to have 8 meats ! is not down to five, the total food item count is down to 140 from it's peak of 150, not counting sauces dressings. ALSO, some of the other Chinese Buffets around the Valley such as certain locations of Hibachi China City are just so good that the competition is really getting tough for this long established place. n nWith that said, Crazy Buffet here slips down to 4 Stars for right now, but I'm certainly still a fan of this friendly, comfortable place that serves up delicious food at a reasonable price, and still including TEN kinds of ice cream! n nWeekday Lunch Buffet 7.99 7.19 Sr.",2
"I came here for a company dinner for 10 and it was great! The only down side was that there wasn't a solid selection of vegetarian items, even though they had one or two entree's and the waiter helped out in selecting items for us he could make veggie which was great. Granted I didn't expect a vase selection of vegetarian items but overall still great place to go and enjoy! Thanks for a good time!",2
"Loved it! If your in Vegas you must visit Rain. We were just there for the 7.7.7 weekend and we had a Skybox by the upstair bar stairs. Not only did they get us in right away but you take a private elevator to the 2nd floor. Skybox was great, very roomy and lots of space to dance when the dance floor gets crowded. We had a great time. I believe the Skybox fits 15ppl or more and they asked for a 3 bottle minnimum.",2
"the dry cleaning portion of this business is fine the prices are pretty decent to. what you need to watch out for is the alterations part, I just needed my husbands brand new Calvin Klein suit pants tailored. I didn't notice because we picked them up the day of the party but my husband later showed me and it looked horrible like I could have done a better job with my sewing machine. it looked awful and I still want to go back and show them but I don't have anything and it's been a few months. this seamstress couldn't even do a straight line I'm so pissed.",1
The food was great. It was a quick service. The cahier was nice except for the manager named Marivic Perez. She was rude with her employees. She yelled one of her employee infront of the customer. I mean that was not right. Be civilize Marivic!,1
I came for Sunday brunch. Nothing stood out. Food was for the most part over cooked and not memorable. Dessert section is ok. Definitely not worth the price and there are so many better buffets in Vegas. Will not be coming back.,1
They dont have many young children toddler games like most of the other Chuck E Cheese ive been to. 4 games had an issue that my daughter played and wheb I called for assistance they moved reaaally slow and were not that friendly. I wont be going back to this cheese.,1
Okay. normally I like Mitchell's but today they had the Corn Beef and Cabbage Potato special for St. Patrick's Day. Well the cabbage and potato were just boiled with no flavor and the corn beef was lunch meat probably cooked again now has lost all flavor. I was so disappointment. And I hate spending money on food that just is not good. Sorry. Thank goodness I had hot sauce and pepper.,1
You did it again Luis. Best coffee in town this time it's easily accessible and parking is readily available. The wait time is shorter and the new barista from LA that made my coffee was amazing! I can't wait until you are on every corner in America.,2
"Went there for lunch and the place had only 2 tables with other patrons n should have walked out then . We were told to sit anywhere and the waiter would bring us menus well after 5 minutes the waiter finally realized we were waiting for menus. Ordered the U conn lobster roll the meat was like chewing rubber but the fries were really good. The service was horrible the waiter never came back to see if we needed anything, We had no spoon to stir our coffee. We had to go up to the counter to get our check. Very disappointed",1
"BEWARE OF THIS PLACE I'm giving a one star since I wasn't yelping the first time I stayed at Rumor. So here goes my shpeal. n nOctober 2012 I stayed at the hotel and apparently there was a body building convention party being held at the hotel I would not consider this a resort by any means and when I purchase my room and as well when I checked in I was not informed that there would be a special event that would disrupt the normal functions of the hotel i.e. Pool access, restaurant, etc. I was denied access to the pool and told I'd need to pay the extremely high cover charge for the wrist band shouldn't room purchase include a wrist band or at least a heads up about pool access charges . As well, I was denied usage of the restaurant do to them closing it down for the weekend event. When I confronted the front desk I was rudely treated and brushed off. n nMy stay this recent time November 13 17 I stayed giving Rumor another chance thinking that maybe things were just tense previously due to the body building event. Well, that turned out not to be the case. Once again things just weren't to part in my opinion. n nHere's my opinion don't call a room a suite of it doesn't have a room separate from the bed. But at the least if you're going to call it a suite make sure everything in the room works. The window blinds were broke and laying on the floor. So after a shower I was giving everyone a nude show through the window. I called it in that night I checked in and was told someone would be over to fix it immediately also bring me an additional pillow and blanket , needless to say no one ever showed up and when I called again to check on it no one picked up. On top of that the AC didn't work so there was literally no air circulation. n nI'm normally the type that doesn't complain about my hotel stays but my experience was just no where near close worth my money both times I stayed. So beware, they don't care how your experience turns out.",1
"Sadly disappointed. n nWe arrived at 7 30 for our reservation to a 1 2 full restaurant and were seated next to a children's table. We ordered a bottle of local wine and our meals which, albeit experimental, were disappointing. The veal was tough and the pork was dull. n nWorst of all, after we finished our expensive but unexciting meal, it took nearly an hour of being ignored by our server before we could leave. For what we paid nearly 300 , we expected a level of service that was sorely lacking at DNA.",1
"When I first visited Al's during their opening week, I was deliciously impressed because their Italian Beef was better thanthe one I had in Chicago. The taste popped in your mouth and the beef was tender fresh and delicious. Unfortunately a lot seems to have changed since then. The last time I went about a week ago I was very disappointed. The beef tasted old, bitter and had fat and gristle. The flavors were flat as if someone had forgotten to stir the pot and the Giordano peppers were limp, oily and flavorless. The best part of the meal was the fries and they were sub par. Very disappointing. What happened to the quality of food they once served? I wish the owners would come back and fix things.",1
Oh dear. This was so disappointing. The ladies don't speak enough English to get an order correct. The food is very bland. I've tried them numerous times. Always a mistake with my take out food.,1
"For my first time, I decided to go full out. I ordered a pineapple agua fresca, a carne asada quesadilla, and three carne asada tacos with joy rice. Chips and salsa were complimentary. n nMy pineapple juice was great! Just the right amount of sweetness! n nChips and salsa were okay. It needed more spice and flavor. The salsa tasted sweet to me. n nMy carne asada quesadilla was BOMB! Probably the best food item I ordered. n nI got my meal about 35 minutes later. The waitress took forever with everything and I didn't like the tacos. The meat had a teriyaki flavor to them topped with some more sweet salsa. I disliked them very much. The rice was better than the tacos, but still tasted off. n nThe decoration was nice. The atmosphere was clean. The best way I could describe this place was ""Mexican food with a hippie twist. "" If that's what they were going for, they nailed it. This place would not be my first choice or on my list to go to again.",1
"I would have given it 5 stars, had it not been for the wait. Honestly, the only reason I love this place is because of our doctor. Dr. Hwang was our on call pediatrician when I had my son, and although she is a bit socially awkward, she is an amazing doctor! I live all the way in Aliante, and I drive to Summerlin because I know my son will get amazing care. I almost didn't use her because it was so far away, but after talking it over, we decided that the distance was worth it, as opposed to ""doctor shopping. "" n nThe office and waiting room are a bit of a mess. The wait times are long, and no, they do not really enforce the ""sick child "" and ""well child "" sides of the rooms. I have even seen so many people waiting, that they had to wait in the hallway. Recently, they called my house two days in a row to confirm an appointment that I made a month ago, saying I was supposed to come in a week before, but that is more of an office mistake than a problem with the doctors. They seem to overbook appointments so the waiting room wait is at least 45 minutes, and then it's another 15 minutes to wait for the doctor, but like I said, that's more of an office problem than a doctor issue. n nDr. Hwang is great with the children. She is gentle, attentive she mentioned my son having congestion before I could bring it up to her and very thorough. She takes her time and answers all of my questions, and as a first time mom, I have a TON of questions. When my son had to get circumcised, she referred me to her husband, which I thought was a little odd at first, but he told my boyfriend that she called three times that day to make sure that my son was not only getting the procedure done, but also to check if he was okay! I have NEVER heard of a doctor doing something like that! I am so happy with her and I know that although I might have to wait a little while, the wait is totally worth it.",2

"Here in barbecucentric Charlotte, California cuisine is practically nonexistent. That is, until Napa on Providence opened in November 2012, taking over the space that Providence Caf u00e9 occupied for twenty plus years, and infusing the Charlotte food scene with a little spice of the northern California countryside. The vibe inside the remodeled restaurant is polished, warm, and inviting with a large bar area plus an attractive patio. n nAs the name suggests, Napa on Providence specializes in Californian cuisine, the root of which is fresh ingredients, simply prepared. Napa takes this tenet seriously all dishes are made to order, from the sauce for the macaroni and cheese to the outstanding white beans with house made sausage, which taste like they've simmered together for hours. n nEverything is thoughtfully executed, all the way down to the drinking water they distill in house and the hammered copper drinking glasses they serve it in. Even the house bread is special. The rolls are handmade by a retired Navy baker. They are dense and chewy and served in recycled cork baskets along with pomegranate honey butter. Once in season, the pomegranates will be harvested from a hundred year old tree at the foot of Napa's patio. n nDinner at Napa starts with small plates, and sharing is encouraged. The food arrives at the table in rustic cast iron skillets perched upon stark white dishes, and each selection is beautifully composed. The small plate offerings include charcuterie, both grilled and raw oysters, and several salads. The meatballs are my personal favorite. Made from a mix of beef and pork, they are studded with small chunks of carrot, stuffed with house made mozzarella, and served perched upon polenta cakes with homemade tomato pomodoro sauce. n nThe steamed clams with homemade sausage are very popular, and are served in a delicious salty white wine sauce with roasted garlic, fennel, and slices of charred crostini. Napa also offers a handful of pizzas, served on house made dough and topped with fresh mozzarella. John, the bartender, raved about the pork pizza. It features porchetta with white cheddar, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers. Speaking of John, I couldn't ask for a friendlier more attentive bartender. His genuine excitement for the food and spirits was contagious. n nThere are several large plate offerings, each masterfully crafted grilled swordfish, halibut, hanger steak, and even a Carolina cheeseburger. There are two pasta dishes the popular lobster macaroni that's made with Velveeta and beer and the bucatini featuring the homemade pomodoro, roasted garlic, and grape tomatoes which I am dying to try . A house favorite as well as one on my personal top picks is the poulet rouge. It's a roasted half chicken with a horseradish pan gravy served with roasted root veggies. Simple, rustic, and delightful. n nEach night, there are chef's specials available. I recently tried the roasted duck with cherry glaze, and as a person who doesn't often favor game, I was very impressed. The risotto served alongside was fantastic. It had baby bella mushrooms and whole cherry tomatoes that added little pops of sweetness to the creamy rice. n nOf course, Napa is known for its wine, and there is an abundance at the restaurant. There are nearly 80 varieties available, with bottle prices ranging from 33 to 175, and approximately twenty varieties available by the glass. At Napa on Providence, the drink specialties encompass more than vino they also barrel infuse several liquors, which are featured in handcrafted cocktails. I tried and thoroughly enjoyed the Napa Manhattan infusion Woodford bourbon lightly infused with cherries, vanilla bean, and sweet vermouth. There are also specialty brunch cocktails, my favorite being the Napa Mimosa, complete with plump pomegranate seeds floating around in the bubbly champagne. Napa rounds out the beverage offerings with pod espresso beverages and loose leaf tea. n nAll great meals should end on a sweet note, and the dessert options are quite enticing. Currently, you can choose between a trio of cr u00e8me brulee, lemon tart pie, a chocolate duo of lava cake and chocolate pot de cr u00e8me, or follow my lead and get the warm caramel apple bread pudding, which I somehow managed to devour every last bite of.",2
"Ok. I hate to be a cynic, but I'm feeling the need to set the yelp record straight here. I don't want fellow Yelpers to be led horribly astray when visiting this fine food lovers city of the north. n nWhenever any friend of mine from New York asks me about places to check out in Montreal, i give them an extensive list of restaurants, bars and attractions to visit.

As i previously stated, Montreal attracts a lot of foodies, and it boasts an incredible number of top tier restaurants for a city its size. You visit it to indulge in steak frites with a pat of butter on top, or artery clogging smoked meat sandwiches, or freshly baked goods from french boulangeries, or copious amounts of beer liquor especially if an you're an American teenager . You do NOT travel to this city to eat brunch at what is basically Canada's answer to IHOP. n nIts true, everyone I know from college and their mother literally has been here a million times, and why some of them continue to go back. well, lets just assume they're ignorant of all the glorious brunch places Montreal has to offer. The ones I know of are mostly in the Plateau and Outremont. Any local you ask in those two areas will tell you to go to Toi Moi et Cafe, or Santropol, or wait in the ridiculously long line at L'Avenue but ohhhh man is it worth it . Even mediocre Place Milton, crammed with clueless university kids, blows this place outta the water. n nSo yeah, don't have high eggspectations when eating here. Its just another lousy chain, and you could most definitely cook better eggs AND home fries in your own kitchen. The only saving grace about this place is that it's better than Chez Cora. I'm not even gonna take the trouble to review THAT one. If Eggspectations is a glorified IHOP, Chez Cora is an overpriced Denny's. n n end tirade ",1
"Typical Chipotle, which I love. However, I noticed a few quirks of this place. First of all, they were super fast here. Maybe even a little too fast since there were two people in line, but then within 15 minutes, I found out why. n nThe line for lunch here is extreme! So it pays to get here early. Nonetheless, from what I observed it does move relatively fast, so don't be deterred.",2
"ACK. I've been to a lot of ""Feast "" buffets, considering I am indeed a Vegas local, but this one in particular was horrendous! I am not sure if it was just that night or if this Feast buffet just is bad in general, but yikes. n nCustomer service Let's start out with one thing, when someone asks you a question, you answer it, you don't reply with something random that wasn't asked. When we walked up to the front we asked the cashier if they offer a military discount, he replied, ""We offer a discount Boarding Pass members, you can go get a card over there "" and he pointed . Uh, well, my husband didn't ask you about your boarding pass card I know, I have one, I've had one since 2006 , he asked you if you offer a military discount. So we walked over and got a stupid card because we were with my MIL and FIL. Two cards discounted buffet for four people. BY THE WAY, we also ate at the SAM'S TOWN buffet three nights before this and they gave my husband a discount when they saw his military ID without him even having to ask. n nNot done yet, so we get back in line and wait now that we have our Boarding Pass cards, and as we go up to the cashier, two people cut in front of us and she allows it. We moved up a little closer so we wouldn't get cut again and the cashier loudly and rudely tells us to ""STEP BACK, MOVE BACK "" no please, just ordering us instructions . n nThe food was pretty horrendous and considering it was Saturday night I expected it to be better. I had a slice of beef and some peel n eat shrimp, everything else was blah. PLUS I had stomach pains the same night we ate here while I was laying in bed trying to sleep. Was it the buffet? Possibly. n nOverall I am really displeased with the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. My parents, and myself have often gone to the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station, which is closer to our home, and it is much, much better than this one, especially with their customer service. n nI suggest the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station teach their cashiers to have a bit better customer service and learn to LISTEN to what the customers are asking rather than just blurting out commands to go and get a Boarding Pass card to get a discount.",1
"The only thing I would come back to this place is on Sunday, for their happy hour all day for some raw oysters, a bit of Fuji apple salad just to have some greens for the day , and perhaps the crab cake if bf is tagging along. n nPlease don't get their calamari. It's the worst calamari I've had in my life, flavor less, breading coat was too thick, and seriously, you can't mix everything with ginger sauce and call it Asian fusion. The fish dishes were alright, but honestly I've had better. n nService wasn't that attentive either, and it wasn't a very crowded night.",1
"I don't get it. I saw all the fantastic reviews on here and thought this place would be awesome for lunch today. n nThe fish for the sushi was sitting out on plates, wrapped in Saran Wrap. There was no ice or refrigeration visible anywhere on it. It was this way before we got there and remained that way after we left. I assume that is just how they roll. n nSo.yay for dangerous raw food temps! n nI got 2 spicy tuna rolls. Ordering a spicy tuna roll at a sushi place is like getting a burger at McDonald's. It is the basic roll. Common, you should know what to expect. n nThese rolls I got were loose, the fish was warmish, the spicy sauce was dribbled over the roll and not inside, and there was nothing else in the roll at all except tuna. It was bland and bad tasting. n nI also got tempura shrimp veggies. These weren't awful, but they were nothing special. In all honesty they were a little under fried. n nMy wife got some sort of shrimp dish with jalape u00f1os on it. There was not enough good for her. We had to get tacos afterwards. And no, she isn't large and is not a big eater. n nDid these guys PAY for the good reviews? n nStay away!",1
"Everyone is really nice here. The food is ok doesnt taste as fresh . I've had better. Its not my choice of filipino food but because its close to where i live so i come here. Their waipahu location is on point i can taste the freshness , so it makes a total difference to me.",1
"I know a few people who rave about these burgers, so my husband and I decided to try them out. After one bite, I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. My burger was completely tasteless, it was falling apart like loose ground beef, and the avocado was nowhere near ripe enough to be edible. The only positive was the manager, who immediately made me a new hamburger after the sauce was mistakenly put directly on my bun when I asked for no sauce at all. I almost feel bad giving 2 stars because the manager was so extremely attentive and nice, but the food was just plain bad. I would say if you are already a fan of Smashburger and are in the Queen Creek area, definitely give this location your business.",1
Needed an eye exam and new glasses desperately. Went shopping in Walmart and decided to make an appointment at the vision center. Got an appointment with Dr. Roter for the same day. nVery thorough eye exam. Explained everything and made me feel very comfortable. nAlmost went for a groupon for another place but so happy I went to see Dr. Roter. nHighly recommended Dr. for your eye exam!,2
"Let me preface this with We Love Village Tavern! n nWe've been going there nearly monthly for over 4 years. This last time, our service was just terrible! If this had been our 1st visit we'd never go back. It was interesting to note that all the tables around us that ordered alcohol received stellar service. MMMMMM It started with ordering drinks, sorry only Arnold Palmer's for the table. Then appetizer, which was great. We had the Colorado Chips. Homemade potato chips with bacon, cheese and BBQ sauce. How bad can that be? Then we ordered our entrees. But NO ONE ever removed the dirty dishes from or appetizers. MMM. So we flagged down someone to fill our water glasses, all the while staring at dirty dishes on our table. Finally we did find our server to refill our drinks, thinking he'd take the plates with him, but NO, there they sat. Finally when our entrees were served we asked that the dirty plates be removed. Got a roll of they eyes, almost like saying, ""that's not my job "". But she took the plates non the less. Not 1 single time during our dinner did our server or anyone else ask how our meal was or how we were doing. We did everything but fill our own water glasses. BUT, the tables on both sides and across from us were attended to like royalty! My partner even ran into the manage in the men's room, and discussed our 'lack' of service. Did he stop by the table after that? NO, or at least not until we'd paid the tab. He then stopped by and gave us 2 cards. 1 for a free appetizer and 1 for a free dessert on our next visit. So, let me get this right.you are asking me to come spend more money with you in order for you to make up for the terrible service I received this time? Well as I started this tirade with, if this was the 1st visit with Village Tavern, I'd NEVER go back. nBut, I've been going there for years and years and years. Even before moving to AZ we'd dined with them. Starting back in 2003 when we were on a vacation here from Chicago. nWill I go back? Yes with trepidation, but I will go back.",1
"Wanna be Pink Taco. Bad service at the bar, the manager explained my friends meal at ""beef "" even though she is a vegetarian and it wasn't that taco. Juke box is a horrible idea. Had to listen to eminem and heavy metal. They send out meals according to when it's ready and prepared so it doesn't get cold in the back, yet it gets cold because you don't want to be rude and start eating without your company having their food. The place itself is very cute and could be really cool, unfortunately I was let down. Save your money and go to chipotle",1
"Nice staff, crazy huge space and a broad selection. This is definitely my favorite REI in the area. The shoe area is extensive and the climbing area is a pinch better than Northlake's location. n nREI is an excellent alternative to EMS for us northern folks . The only problem with REI is I can't ever leave without spending money.",2
"Excellent food and unique menu selection. n nWe were looking for a nice dinner in Montreal and spent quite a while looking for someplace more 'upscale' in the downtown area. The menu here looked interesting Italian, seafood, a French flare so we tried it out. No lines, no waiting, BYOW all good. n nI hadn't tried this place before so didn't know what the mussels were like but really wanted to try them. I think I made the right call by getting the mussels as an appetizer instead of an entry. They were absolutely delicious and they give you plenty, but just personally would prefer a meat pasta dish as an entree. n nI got the veal marsala as an entree. The sauce was yummy but the meat was a little tough. I won't hold that against them. I would definitely recommend Restaurant l'Academie to anyone looking for a reasonably priced upscale dinner and enjoys mussels.",2
"Been going there for a while however stopped going because they charged me for salsa when I had a to go order. Mexican food places are a dime a dozen and I refuse to pay for salsa, this was a first time for me getting billed for salsa. Lol",1
"I reserved an Economy car online from Fox two months in advance. When I arrived at the Vegas Airport I had to go to the normal car rental shuttles. From there I rode to the Airport Car Rental Location. Then I had to walk to the cab area and wait for another shuttle from Fox. From there is was another 10 minute ride to Fox rental. At Fox rental office I was told that they didn't have any economy vehicles and that the only thing available was a 08 PT Cruiser. I expressesed to the agent that I didn't want a PT cruiser and that anything else wold work. He looked and got a set of keys but said it would cost 7 more perday for a differant car. PT cruiser wasn't even listed in their car list and had it been I would not have reserved with Fox. I ended up having to take the PT cruiser and was given a number to call to trade out cars if one was available. No one answered that number the next day. I finally had to spend 2 hours of my vacation on the phone talking to Fox Corporate. I was disconnected 3 times and it wasn't until I spoke with a supervisor that I was able to get anything done. I had to drive back to the Rental to trade cars. Another hour of my vacation gone. They were very rude , at least the Scott that I spoke with and ended up giving me an even worst car with less gas mileage than the Cruiser. I think it wrong to advertise a class of car you don't even have, much less a make you don't advertise. When I returned home and checked the web on Fox I found that the rate I received should have given me a full sized car. The also refused to honor the car up grade coupon as well as one I had for 7 discount. I definately say if want to get a 3 year old PT Cruiser and be treated RUDELY this is you rental place. I personally will not return. I don't like being told , take it or leave it.",1
"Only 4 people working behind the check in desk at 6pm on a Tuesday with over 40 people waiting in line to check into their rooms? Come on Mirage. n nAlso, if you plan on using the internet in the room, prepare for slow reception and dropped off connections. Bad hotel if you plan on needing the internet in your room for doing business during your stay.",1
"Got back around to this one today after a year and a half or so, joined this time by Robyn N. Mike C. They were featuring 106 items at lunch time today, plus sauces dressings, everything was good. Some special treats this time were the real Crab Salad, Duck Noodles, Coconut Shrimp, excellent, juicy fried chicken, omelet style Egg Foo Young with Duck Sauce, good Mongolian BBQ with three meats. n nOne small negative for me is that you have to ask for Sushi they prepare it for you. I prefer to have it freshly made, yes, but already sitting out there for you to help yourself to. Another thing today was that some of the premium items were missing that I enjoyed last time, such as Squid Salad, Bow Tie Seaweed, Hawaiian Chicken Chinese Show Peas. With that said, I do still like this place and they have held the weekday lunch prices the same at 8.99 8.19 Sr. n nPS There's a full bar unusual for a Chinese Buffet , a small outdoor patio with tables chairs.",2
"Omg.I finally came here! Man I was super excited coming to experience what all my help friends have been talking about. A hot dog.yes a hot dog.not what you would ever expect. These dogs are art! From the min I walked into the restaurant I find a small table and grabbed a menu look at all the options. Mac n chees dog or the Bear with peanut butter? After suggestions from the server she tells me I have to try the Bear because it's their famous dog. Wow I'm glad I did! The best hot dog I've ever had in my life. I'm a huge fan of peanut butter, but I was a little worried about the BBQ sauce and cheese, but nope. Tasted amazing together. I can't wait till I can come back for another one! n nThe rest if the dogs also looked good. Plus they serve local beers too. n nOverall Short Leash is amazing. I'm going to make this my must stop when I'm in downtown.",2
"We woke up late but still wanted to breakfast. Not knowing what our options where in terms of ""Denny's "" and ""IHOPs "" in Canada, we decided to check this place out. They serve breakfast until 4pm. Great place, great options, and we were able to get our pancakes and toast in the afternoon!",2
"Pretty good unique donuts, just the service is not so good. Drive thru in the am is longer than Starbucks. Waited 15 minutes behind one car and when she finally came to window, she didn't even apologize for the long wait. Why don't they have the menu in the window? Instead of handing it to you in the car when you pull up? Think this will be last trip to pink box, the car behind me started honking. annoying way to start the morning.",1
"I actually like this place. Good luck finding a Gyro place anywhere close by here so you have to score some points for that. Is it the best Gyro I have ever had? No, but I can't complain. Actually just thinking about I may have to make a trip over there.",2
"Come here for the baked goods, not the friendly service. Some days you get a smile, most days you don't. But if you ignore that and pay for your baked goods, you'll get a treat. Rich, buttery cookies and cakes that look and taste homemade. If you're lucky, the counterperson might let you stand there a while and admire the bread, if not take a look at their day old goods and refrigerated cakes. Stop salivating and buy something! I'll take a cheese danish ",2
Came across this place by accident. Glad we stopped in. After a long day of shopping this really hit the spot.Tried this place pretty good. I would come back when I'm visiting Vegas. The spring rolls not so good,2
The service was excellent. My salmon was cooked to perfection.This is a great place to get Northern Italian food.,2
Wow. Seriously authentic Mexican street food in Pittsburgh. They even have Mexican Coca Cola with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup . n nAn instant hit. Great for a bite when you're visiting the National Aviary or Children's Museum on the north side.,2
"Love this place. Met up with a good friend for Happy Hour here. I actually enjoy coming here by myself from time to time and people watch from the bar. There's always somethin' on their wine list to accommodate Love their pizzas and salads. A restaurant that knows how to tease me properly with Nutella as an ingredient will always receive high praise from me! Decor and setting is perfect for friends and family If wear permits and is ideal, I highly recommend dining out on their patio. Can't say anything negative about this place.",2
"I bought a Travelzoo Local Deal to use here. It sounded like such a great deal 39 for 2 entrees, 2 apps and 2 beers regularly 76 and you get to watch a game on top of it. Well, I could not have been more wrong! I tried twice to make reservations to watch football here. Both times I was told that I would be charged an additional 50 in order to get seating where I could view a game. What? I bought this deal since it was advertised as being able to come watch a game and enjoy dinner. The choice given to me was to sit on the patio with no televsion access if I was going to be able to use the deal with Travelzoo. Their explanation has been ""mangement reserves all rights "". I guess they do have the right to use false advertisement and not honor the deals that they have offered to locals.",1
Ridiculously overpriced for the quality and service. 18.00 for a sliced wedge salad that was poorly presented. Sides equally priced yet very small portions. Steaks from 54.00 to 260.00 for a 6 oz Kobe Filet imported from Japan. I had the NY Strip. I've had better food at Long Horn. The only thing I can figure is that their rent must be very high.,1
"I love, love, love, love, love, love, love this place. LOVE. As the daughter of a New York Italian who knows her way around the kitchen, it's so wonderful to find a place that has food almost exactly like moms. n nThe pizza is fantastic, as good as real NY pizza, and even better than some places in NY. And the wings are AMAZING. One thing I will say about the wings, I generally order the hot sauce on the SIDE. It's a very hot sauce and they are drenched in it. I find the medium sauce to be a bit bland and greasy, so I find that just being able to control the amount of hot sauce I have is the best option. But the wings themselves are delicious and crispy. None of that fatty, flappy, grisly bits you get at chain pizza places. n nI usually expect the actual entrees at a pizza place to be pretty bad. Before trying their entrees, I had never had a positive experience with pasta or Italian entrees at pizza places. But La Famiglia's entrees and pasta is delicious. Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes and I love theirs. Their tortellini pesto is quite good too. A bit heavy on the pesto, but that's just being nitpicky. n nCannolis? Amazing. nThey used to have Black and White cookies that were so delicious, but apparently no one orders them so they no longer make them. I do hope people start requesting them more so they will bring them back! n nI'm not in LOVE with most of their other appetizers. The batter on their fried foods calamari, zucchini, etc. is a bit heavy for me and I feel a bit sick after just a few bites and find I don't want to eat anything else. So I never order them. I do wish they'd reconsider the batter and come up with something lighter because I'd love to be able to get some calamari. I also wish the calamari was just rings and not the tentacles, because. well. tentacles. n nMy one other criticism is that they are pretty strict and misleading about their hours. They say it's delivery until 8 00PM on the weekdays, but if you call after 7 30PM, you're out of luck. I think this is far too early to stop delivery to begin with, but if you are going to advertise for 8 00PM, I think you should take orders until 8 00PM. n nI did see some reviews about rude staff. I did have ONE bad experience awhile back, but haven't had any trouble since. It's family owned and operated, with a few non family employees. And, well, everyone has a bad day. My one experience hasn't deterred me from going, nor has their rigid policies on their hours. n nOverall, I still give it 5 full stars, regardless of personal feelings about some menu items or policies because the food is good enough that it really doesn't even matter. Please go. and request black and white cookies so I can have them again!",2
"LIke the other reviewer, I stayed here because I had a free BW night to use that was about to expire. Never again, even for free. n nI got to my room, and immediately cracked up at the GIGANTIC wood cabinet console tv from god knows what era. I will attempt to post a picture, as it needs to be seen to be believed. I left my room once to get take out food at the ""Italian "" restaurant on property. Very sleazy joint. I wanted to take a shower after even being in there, but that would require getting into the gross shower in my bathroom wow, what a toss up. Needless to say, I did not leave my room once I got back very sketchy neighborhood. And I left the next day as soon as possible. n nDo not stay here.",1
"Was once one of the best buffets around. In the last few months it's turned into the buffet from Vegas Vacation. They had multiple great selection but now it's all horrible and dry and cheap. They had a platter marked Chicken Parm. It was dried out chicken in a pan of crusted old tomato sauce and they spooned even older and drier pesto on top! Looked horrible. Trout was great but now it's dry and tasteless. Meat was like shoe leather, and even the salad section was really weak, wilted and boring. Desserts were pretty good but limited. Stay away. Sucks.",1
"Visited Armitage Bistro for the first time yesterday with high hopes, seeing as though it's a wine bar and we really love Bomberos, Postino and 5th Wine elsewhere in the valley. n nOrdered up a few glasses of wine for a special price of 5 on happy hour, which is normal HH pricing at a wine bar. The wine was good. Their happy hour lasts til 7pm, later than most other wine bars, which is a plus. n nAppetizers were 5, so we sampled the Bruschetta, Warm Spinach Dip, Toasted Ravioli and a half order of french fries. n nLet's start with the Bruschetta, you get to choose 4 types, so we went with 2 Tomato Fresh Mozzarella, 1 Mushroom Gorgonzola and 1 Chopped Tomatoes Roasted Garlic. n nAs the bruschetta arrived, my first impression was that it was definitely a smaller portion than I'm used to receiving at other wine bars that I frequent. It's essentially one piece of some type of normal sized sliced bread cut into 4 pieces and dressed up with different toppings. I much prefer the bread portions at Bomberos other spots. n nThe Tomato Fresh Mozzarella bruschetta was highly UNimpressive. In fact, it really wasn't good. The tomato slices weren't red, they were thin, the fresh mozzarella wasn't impressive and there was barely any basil on them. Big bummer for us since this is usually our most favorite type of bruschetta. n nOn to the next type! The Chopped Tomatoes Roasted Garlic was okay, but we didn't prefer it much due to the overly garlic flavor. If you're into garlic, you'll like the taste here, but again, the bread contributed to a disappointing experience with this bruschetta. n nThe Mushroom Gorgonzola bruschetta was delicious! Definitely our favorite out of the different bruschetta types we sampled. n nNext up we got the ""Warm Spinach Dip "" which is described on the menu as ""Spinach, Artichoke Hearts, Irish Cheddar Asiago Cheese nServed with Warm Bread Pita "". I'm not familiar with Irish cheddar, but this dip was almost entirely cheese and had a very sticky globby feel. There didn't seem to be much spinach artichoke in it. We didn't really enjoy this dish. n nNext up was the toasted ravioli. Not too shabby, but not overly impressive either. It was a good effort and we ate it with the provided marinara dipping sauce. n nLastly we got a half order of seasoned french fries. These were pretty decent. They come with 2 sauces, one of which is a red pepper ranch type sauce that was good. The other is a BBQ esque sauce with some other twist, but we didn't really dig that one. I did enjoy dipping my french fries into the aforementioned cheese dip. n nOverall for the price, and even at a discounted happy hour price, we didn't feel it was worth our money. The bruschetta could definitely use some improvement, especially the Tomato Fresh Mozzarella variety.",1
"If Hillcrest, San Diego has Urban Mo's, Phoenix has Charlies, and I'd pick Charlies most times. I don't know why it wins my heart, maybe it's pride knowing that as a bar, it's a landmark especially in a young city like Phoenix. They've got cheap drinks, sometimes depending on the day cute cowboys. and its afterhours has got good beats. It's a large bar too when it comes to the Phoenix gay club scene. not warehouse big like other clubs in other larger gay places. like Rich's in Hillcrest, or the Abbey in Weho. it's big enough with a good sized dance floor and plenty of space to walk around inside and outside. And who can beat an in house Taco Shop vendor? I mean, heck that deserves two stars alone. greasy mexican food next door without having to drive thru. heck yes! Boo. to the 3 cover after midnight for Afterhours but they got to make money over the youngin's and 3 really isn't that bad. I think I deny them one star because of the inconsistent Tic Tac shots. One barman knew how to make it right, while the other made it heck a lot strong that it was hard to swallow that I almost gagged! My four stars goes to a good atmosphere. and strong drinks but hey strong drinks are an expectation at all gay bars. so whatev. Anywho, if you're getting bored at the bar or club you're at and you need a new experience and still want to have a good time with strong drinks. make your way to Charlies!",2
Rose tea def a great spot ! Order the traditional beef and broccoli and my guest orders the beef noodle stew we both were completely satisfied and very impressed with the quality of the food! Portions were great . Staff was VERY sweet and friendly ! We finished off with some bubble tea! Glad to say I'd love to return here !,2

"Yayo is amazing. The food is good and the vibe is awesome. Its really a college student hangout. If you don't like the live music which is on often, take your food to go. There is no reason for you being here obviously so just take your grub to go. Most of the shows are local underground shows, and they often play a lot of punk stuff too, so the selection isn't really to most peoples taste. But I love it.",2
"This was an OK place to go. The restaurant was clean, atmosphere was.unremarkable. I wouldn't say my food was spectacular, but it was plenty good enough to visit again if you just have a craving for standard, basic Americanized Chinese food. My waiter seemed very bored because it was quite slow, but I received my food in timely fashion and the prices were more than fair.",1
"Stopped by for the chance to shoot some automatic weapons at zombie targets. It isn't cheap and there was a long wait, but it was worth it.

I'd never tried Moroccan food, this was my first time, and I'm so glad she introduced us. The service is exceptional to say the least. The staff is so friendly and genuine.

"After being gone for nearly two months, the far to overzealous sign spinner employed by this business IS UNFORTUNATELY BACK at 202 and Chandler and the manager of this place hung up on me when I was discussing the problem again. I guess I'll have to resort to uploading to youtube the dash cam videos of this idiot sign spinner repeatedly dropping his sign in the street and the antics and lengths he goes to to get attention for this business which is obviously not successful enough with its existing customer base to stay in business. Businesses that are successful and packed do so by remembering who the customer is and providing a good product at a fair price, NOT by trying to attract so much attention that they risk causing traffic accidents and repeatedly annoy drivers to the point they call the police! The traffic accident most likely to occur is one where a driver is trying to turn the corner and is distracted by this idiot's sign or yelling and they get hit T bone style RIGHT IN THE DRIVERS DOOR! I knew someone that was T boned in the drivers side and SHE AND HER 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ARE DEAD! If you want to take back our streets from the idiot sign spinners like the one used by this business, DON'T GO THERE! I would never again think of going to this business!",1
"This place use to be our go to place for shawarma but has since changed hands and currently does not offer anything on the Mediterranean menu anymore. The quality of their ingredients have also been lowered freezer fries for ""fresh cut fries "" .",1
"Maybe I'm rating this place a little higher than it deserves but that has to be in part because I have never once paid to eat here. They send me free coupons, I go to eat. The food is fine, nothing too special. I usually get a steak and cheese and chicken noodle soup. Both are very generous portions, especially the soup. It's a slight cut above your average casino snack bar food. Adjacent to the sports book so you can watch the game while you eat. I've always had very friendly service and I love that the self serve soda machine has Coke Zero.",2
"A lactose intolerant person's worst nightmare. My best friend, especially during a breakup. n nThis custard joint is truly delightful. They have it all custard, burgers, hot dogs, and cheese curds. n nAfter revisiting that list of food, I'll probably go kayaking on Wingra before indulging as to avoid food guilt. n nBut really, this place is the place to be if you want a good burger or an icy treat. It has a drive in vibe, with outdoor seating, only basic utensils to gorge on their food, and neon signage. It's great during the warmer months, but you can always use the drive thru if you're craving comfort food during the colder seasons.",2
"This place is incredible! The line seems neverending, but it's well worth the wait. Their price is really decent, considering I went to Caesar's and Wynn's buffet for almost the same price and was disappointed in how limited their options were. n nWhen I first got to Rio's buffet, I was so confused on where I should first go. They have dishes from all over the world like all the other casino buffets but the difference is that Rio's is gargantuan in space and has an incredibly vexing amount of selections. Even if I took a very minute morsel from each station, it just wouldn't have been possible to try everything. A person really has to pick and choose what they want to eat beforehand, because this place will make you dizzy with food. n nTheir dessert selection is just as copious. It was almost frustrating to try and pick one or two because my stomach couldn't ingest anymore! I have never been in a place with so many options I feel like I have to come here at least ten times to get the taste of everything. n nAll in all, the food is delicious and well worth the money.",2
I had a very good stay here. Check in was great. Very capable friendly staff let me check in early 11am . Only downside was not a very good bar in the hotel. Room was very clean comfortable.,2
"As a straight woman, I can say that I've been to almost every gay bar in the city. I think the only two I've missed are Central Station and the Woodshed, but I don't understand why anyone would go to those anyway, straight or not. Somehow, when I wasn't looking, I ended up with an arsenal of gay men as my best friends. n nI can also say, without hesitation, that Sidelines is one of my favorite bars in the city. Not one of my favorite gay bars, one of my favorite bars, period. You do either have to have a membership or pay a cover usually 5 to get in, but I think it's worth it. They have great drink specials, and the bartenders are great. Pool is free, Wii is free, darts and cornhole are free. Generally, our time is spent hijacking the jukebox with weird songs Monster Mash, anyone? and writing made up personals ads on the little slips of paper intended for getting someone's number, and then leaving them in odd places for Kevin and Ralph to find. We also hosted an impromptu Belinda Carlisle Dance Party a few weeks ago. Yes, that was us. Sorry. I was the one on the pool table. n nWe generally say we're going to start there, but more than once we have just stayed there all night. Plus Skyland is right next door for easy access, so why would you ever want to leave?",2
" Disclaimer Haven't been in this store, just had a cupcake. n nLast summer when Missy F. was staying with my Dude and I for a while, she popped into Mind Over Batter and brought us both a cupcake as her way of saying, ""THANKS, Y'ALL!

I actually pretty surprised by how horrible the ratings are. We LOVE this pizza and so has everyone that has eaten it with us. We live in the area and get coupons. We decided to give it a try and actually REALLY enjoy the crust. There was one pizza we asked for pepperoni and bacon. The bacon was shopped so finely and PACKED with flavor. nI've never had a bad experience! nWe will continue to order from here. nNever had an issue with staff.although I could see where people placing pick up orders have some issues.we just haven't. Might just order one today actually.,2
"Ok, here it goes. Came here with my wife for her birthday. Upon arrival, looks great, pond out front is a nice touch. Outdoor seating in the right weather looks like it could be really nice. Inside, its fine. n nChips and salsa were delivered right away, and quite good to boot. n nWife ordered chicken fajitas and I ordered beef fajitas. When they arrived, everything seemed OK, although both seemed overly greasy, and after a few bites, it was very greasy. The beef and the chicken had zero seasoning on them, they were both very bland. The sides they give to build the fajita are ok, but no sour cream? Seemed odd to have to pay for a side of sour cream when we were paying 18 per plate of fajitas. The house made guac was very average. One last note about the beef it was cooked to well done which made it quite tough. The portions were quite large. n nThe service was good offered informed suggestions and was prompt and polite. n nOverall, the experience was fun with the wifey. But the 18 fajitas left much to be desired. Havent decided if we will give this place another try.",1
I live just down Commonwealth and absolutely going to Common Market to get one of there deli sandwiches! The Californian is my favorite. They have a great wine and beer selection as well and have wine tastings and other events throughout the week! Check 'em out!,2
"I have been a member of the LA Fitness clubs since 2000. I have had great experiences with the ones in the past. Unfortunately, this particular club is very out dated and needs new equipment ASAP. If I have time I drive an extra twenty minutes to workout at the Mc Cormick Ranch one and if I have even more time I visit my favorite one which is located just passed old town Scottsdale. Also they have no juice bar, but they do have vending machines. However, the staff is nice at this location.",1
"Is there a selection for ZERO!? nKiosk doesn't take cash for carry on bag 50 dollars , get to the gate to pay cash, price bumped up 100 dollars.

"Went there with a party of 11, we all gave this place a 10 plus. Everything was Delicious and we are all definitely coming back.",2
Came back after 5 months to check it out again. If you want a beer and watch a game it's OK. There is no reason to eat here. It's mediocre at best and nothing stands out. Too bad Arrowhead needs more quality options!,1
"Came here the other night and ordered the 4 plate meal. The chicken was dry, the brisket was fatty I know there should be some fat but I should have taken a picture for you to see what I mean, Meh , only got three ribs, and finally the pulled pork was pretty good. Reason for 2 stars. three of the four things were sub par.Probably won't be going back anytime soon.",1

"I'm very patient when it comes to restaurants and bad service. I have a 3 strike rule, so even if I have a bad experience once, even twice I will often try to understand and consider why the food or service was bad.

I like other NNY locations just not this one.",1
"It is easy to drive by this place,as the main sign is for the bar,as the pizza joint is inside the bar. Which was very smoky,dark and a few locals hanging out. The cook was actually doing his paperwork at the bar,so he looked like one of the patrons? Anyway the food is ok, just too smoky to wit for your pizza and wings to go,as I would not sit and eat there,unless you like hanging out in a smoky,smoky,stinky bar,it just doesn't make the food taste good. Staff was friendly, but I don't think I will go bk. nMore on their food i did not get a pizza,but opt for wings, it was ok,nothing to write home about it. The portion are average, about the same for all places that serve wings and pizza. It was hard to find the place because the sign for naked city pizza was very small and un noticeable.As you see the reviews they are mixed and I cannot say it would be 4 or 5 stars either. I got wings,because I was in a hurry to get in and out of there,maybe if I ever go back I would try the pizza?",1
"Don't let the fact this place is in a gas station fool you. Extremely clean, and the food is fresh and good! Nachos are amazing. The main guy that works is fast and nice.",2
"This church is all about prosperity gospel preaching. Money money money. It is more concerned with tickling the congregations ear instead of confronting sin. It is more concerned with growing its congregation and revenues by appealing to the ""modern day Christian. "" Some so called Christians choose to be Christians because they expect to gain some sort of worldly blessing from it. But being a Christian entails suffering and sacrifice because you are not supposed to conform to the world. In Matthew 7 21 23 Jesus talks about true and false disciples. He is not talking to atheists, agnostics, or folks with different religions. He is talking to so called Christians. n n ""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' Matthew 7 21 23 NIV ",1
"Great place! Recently moved to the neighborhood and tried a couple of places and by far this is my favorite. Nice staff, very clean shop.

"How interesting is this place. nPosh is the word that I would use when walking in the doors off the strip. the lounges are lit in such sexy ways with lush fabrics and pillows all around. n nThe set up of the floors is also cool. The casino on the main level, the stores on the 2nd and the restaurants on the top. Makes it easy to find what you are looking for. nThe chandelier on the ceiling is pretty top notch as well. nLit in such cool ways and it is massive! Engulfs the entire staircase!",2

Although I haven't tried all the options, the options that I have tried have all been pretty good at least when compared to most cafe foods. n nFor those of us working in the medical sciences center across the street, Aldo's is a blessing.

The street tacos were very salty and the avocado egg rolls had a weird guava sauce that made the rolls taste gross. They might want to taste there product before it goes out.,1
"Poor bar service! The bartender had no idea about any drinks! I asked her to make me something good, to surprise me she did by saying, "" she doesn't drink! So she has no idea!

"Well. I won't go into gory details but let me just say I finally had a ""personal "" experience with the madness that I have been overlooking because I myself was always treated well here. Let me just say that the ever changing staff here indicates the real problem with Hacker's. Even in a field like food service that historically is known for quick turn over, Hacker's stands out of the crowd. If you eat here and have a good experience with a competent server, 'ya better get to know them fast because chances are, they won't be here long. I have a feeling that ""Debra R's "" recent review as an ex employee was far more accurate than I wanted to believe. I have gone from a regular to someone who won't ever return here until I see a ""Under New Ownership "" sign out front.

I'm cleaning up my draft reviews and was here 2 17 12 so this bad review is long overdue. I'm no decorator but the black and yellow outside colors make you think you're in a Western Union or some check cashing place.which would probably make better bagels and whitefish salad anyway! Round bread with a hole in the center does not mean it's a bagel! Tasted more like pretzel dough but more bland. They sell Dr. Browns in bottles which is always good but no Celrey soda ? I don't know about the deli meat because i was going just for breakfast bagel fish but as far as bagels are concerned I guess it's better than Lender's bagels or a Fast food chain. The whitefish salad was too loose and with no discernible whitefish flavor. Ain't nuttin New Yawk about this place food wise.,1
The best juices in town! I recommend the Kale Cleanse! nThe Acai bowl is also fantastic!,2
"Going to keep this one simple, came here when they first opened and things haven't changed. People are very friendly and that's about it. This burger consistently reminds me of a Bob's Big Boy burger yet 3x the price. In and Out, Fatburger and Smashburger will continue to be better as far as taste and price, especially the meat flavor and toppings. Some people love this place from their other locations around the country, but an official meh from me for this location.",1

"On 11 17 2013 I went thru security on the D Gate of the airport, I'm older baby boomer and experienced racial profiling for the first time in my life. I went thru the security and my clothes set off the detector. I would have been ok if the female TSA just searched in key areas to see if I was ok to go thru. No, she took it there, as if I was being suspected of carrying drugs. She asked me if I wanted to go in a private room and I declined, she searched all over my body, between my legs twice and lifted my shirt and proceeded to run her hands along the inside of my pants, I asked her if she want me to unfasten them, she said no. She did everything except a cavity search, who knows what would have happened if I'd accepted the offer to go to a private room, with no witnesses, no way. One older lady, looks older than myself, said don't you want to be safe, I replied, ""this has nothing to do with safety. "" And after she was done, she took the glove off and handed to another TSA agent, and he put them under this detector, and since it showed no signs of whatever she was looking for, I was cleared to go thru. I found it very degrading and humiliating. Unfortunately, because United was oversold, I had to purchase another ticket and fly out from Southwest, I had to go thru security on the C gate, no problems with TSA . Mind you, this is the same airport, same day, different gate.",1

"Chinese Mexican Jamaican fusion cuisine.who knew?!? Well, evidently a lot of people now, thanks to Diners, Drive ins, and Dives. We've been twice we're only in Phoenix twice a year, or we'd probably be here once a week, at least! n nThe BF had his fave, chile relleno. It comes coated with crunchy Panko crumbs, which he loved. This time I had the emerald chicken, with a sauce like a ginger green onion pesto that rocked my taste buds. I also had the jen red pork the meat was a little dry. The jade red chicken, which is similar, had more moist meat when I had that last time and seemed to fit the sauce better. n nWe both had the black beans, which are highly flavored and have a hint of heat. They beat all other beans I've ever had anywhere else. Their machaca is the same in that respect uniquely flavored and heads above the rest no egg in this version, in case you're looking for them. n nThere are 4 rice choices I am not a rice person, so I can't comment fairly here. There are also many more entree choices, including an all vegetable dish. I'm sure we'll get around to each and every one in subsequent visits!",2
"Service was all right, the food was pretty good, but the bathrooms didn't look clean at all. I usually check the bathroom to determine the cleanliness of a place and the bathroom was disgusting. The smell of the last occupant lingered for a good 5 minutes and I still felt dirty even after I washed my hands. n nAnyway, the food was pretty good. I'm not really a Pho connoisseur so I got the basic pho with beef balls. The server we had was all right. He didn't ask if I wanted a refill on my drink which bothered me because he refilled everyone else's but mine.",1
"I love trying the good restaurants in Vegas, but eating out for every meal can get expensive. Luckily Estiatorio Milos has a prix fixe lunch menu so you can try this restaurant without breaking the bank on the dinner menu. The prix fixe lunch menu is 22.14 and includes an appetizer, entr u00e9e and dessert. I ordered the meze plate, which comes with a red pepper hummus, white fish spread, cucumber tziki sauce, feta cheese, olives, and pita. I wish the pita bread had a little more flavor, but the spreads were delicious. My boyfriend ordered the smoked salmon bagel and this was also very good. I suggest getting both and splitting! n nFor my entr u00e9e I ordered the salmon. I can easily say this was one of the best cooked pieces of salmon I have ever eaten. There was olive oil and capers drizzled on the broccoli and salmon and that was the perfect amount of seasoning that was needed. I was debating about ordering the sea bass or the salmon before and I'm happy I went with the salmon. n nThe dessert options were greek yogurt or fruit. Not that I should have to tell you this, but you should order the greek yogurt. It comes with a raspberry puree and was a decadent and perfect end to the meal. I'd be interested in trying this place for dinner as well, but the lunch menu is a great way to try a 4 star rated restaurant in Las Vegas!",2
"Clown company. Can't describe it otherwise. An hour late, plus forgot an order? Is it a fluke? You'd hope, but this event happened 3 times in a row. Save yourself some time and pick up your own food or use another company. The sheer rudeness and disconnect from decent customer service is reason enough to look elsewhere. Apparently whenever your order is missing an item it is the restaurant's nfault. Way to throw your affiliated business under the bus to cover yourself. It's not hard to smell past the BS. n n nWho runs this place? Surprised bigger or trustworthy business has not taken you over yet. Your framed website is hysterical which makes me to laugh at why I would think our food would come as ordered.

"I've actually been coming to zenith even before I moved to Pittsburgh I've lived here since July 2013 . For the most part, as long as you don't mind sharing a table with other customers, you can get seated reasonably fast. All of their buffet and entree food has been delicious. One thing I do not like is that not all their entrees are vegan even though everything on the buffet is. Prices have gone up over the past years, but I totally understand that. This is an awesome place for brunch to bring ""out of towers "" because not only is it a restaurant but also an antique shop.",2

"I wish I could write a full review of Reuben's, unfortunately I can't comment on the food as I was never seated. I can, however, comment on the service. n nMy wife was off eating with friends, and I was on my own for dinner. Since Reuben's was close to my hotel and well reviewed, that was where I'd planned on eating. n nAfter arriving, I informed the hostess that I wanted a table for one, and that I would be happy to sit at the bar since they were busy. She took my name, told me it would be 20 minutes, and directed me to the waiting area. I waited. After she began seating people who came in after me at the bar, I asked why I'd been passed over. She looked at her sheet and said I had accidentally been overlooked. She told me they would have me seated within 15 minutes. n nWhat?! I asked her if she was serious and she nodded dismissively. n nHaving no backup plan for dinner, I decided to wait it out. 20 minutes later, it happened again. A group that came in after me was seated. I asked if I'd been skipped again and her response was, ""It appears so. "" n nAfter standing there for over 40 minutes, I walked out.

"" she didn't even speak one word to me, she seemed upset looking that I broke up there conversation. So I asked her what do I do with my little hand basket I had and she finally spoke and told me ""YOU have to put it away at the exit door "" and just pointed sharply at the door. So I went to put it away and then she demanded to see my ID I gave her my ID and she wrote stuff down on a paper and called the manager up since I have an ID that isn't sideways but I am 21 and I had no complaints I understand why the manager was called, he came up and checked it and that was all, THEN she continued with the sell and she ranged my items up AND THREW THEM IN THE BAG. She didn't lightly or gently placed my glass bottles in a bag but TOSSED AND THREW them like it didn't matter if they break and she continued to slouch and roll her eyes and just handed me my receipt and went back to talking to her friend. No thank you or smile or anything she was just straight up rude. I'm never going back to this one maybe none since other places sell better products and are nicer.",1
WORST Burger King EVER! nI thought like the previous reviewer that all Burger Kings are alike. For some reason this is not the case and the burger king in fountain hills is only consistent for SUCKING and SCREWING UP YOUR ORDER and never bringing it to you when they tell you to wait outside. I have had the misfortune to eat at this one over the past few years and it sucks even more now that they did this big fancy remodel than before. Here is a tip Dont waste a bunch of money on some expensive remodel and then expect to stay in business giving people crappy COLD and OLD fries that they have to wait 15 minutes for. This place sucks. Never going there again.,1
"This nail salon was definitely much better than I expected. Very friendly staff as well as good nail work. I got the mani pedi combo priced fair at 42 for a gel mani and regular pedi. I had two different ladies, both which were very good. Although I will say my pedicure was the best experience. I'm very picky about my pedicures. I like when they take their time grooming my nails and this lady did just that. Got rid of all dead skin and ingrown nails. Took her time and did not rush. Well done. The mani was good but felt the painting of the actual nail could have been a little better. There were spots with no color. Over all, good place to come.",2
"Lunch here was a steal. So worth the 15 minute drive down I 15 forget Las Vegas Blvd . At 15, with beer and wine included, the selection and quality here is definitely way higher than the buffets at higher end hotels. n nA few things if you're looking for sushi don't come here for lunch. It looked like they were prepping fish for the evening as we were finishing lunch but that never made it to the line. n nTheir prepared salads here are quite good and their breads which is really surprising .

For what were supposed to be never frozen hand breaded chicken tenders on my wife's salad they did a remarkable job of looking and tasting like something frozen from Sysco. n nThe A C seemed like it was being piped in from the 7th circle of hell, the waitress didn't know the menu, didn't seem concerned that my wife only ate 3 bites of her food and instead of asking if something was wrong just offered a box, etc. The decor is cool but that's about the only positive thing I can say. We won't be going back.",1
"Whenever I'm in Vegas, I really love to hit up Marquee because of their friendly service, and how organized they are! I've been to their Daytime Pool Party as well as their Night Scene both equally awesome! The environment is very welcoming, cozy, and decor is very me Modern and the Mgr Terry is just wonderful! He always takes care of me and my people whenever we're there. Kudos, Marquee!",2
"Okay, this place has received a ton of slack from prior reviews. I am not a huge fan of the food nor the 1950's style decor, but the people are nice and I have been more than satisfied with the spinach queso dip. I actually do get a craving for it which draws me every few months to that bright turquoise and black decor. nThe lunch menu is very reasonable and the lunch portion of the pollo magnifico was good! What this place lacks in food, is made up in quick, fairly friendly service, and an area that is convenient to downtown Scottsdale and the Giants Spring training stadium. I like the breezy patio area but the big black birds that stalk the fallen corn chips under your chair are a bit frightening. But after a game this March, I am actually looking forward to spinach dip and margarita at Julio G's.",1
"My wife and I went to Stingray with high hopes based on a previous visit to another location. This experience was a large disappointment. n nWe arrived at 6 15 on a Thursday evening, and we were able to get a seat right away. We found out we were there during happy hour, so we ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks were good, and unique, and the crunchy spicy tuna appetizer was also good, but that was where it ended. n nThe other appetizer was a shrimp tempura roll, which was average at best, then came the main course. My wife ordered the spicy shrimp roll which was also average, with more rice than fish, and the lava roll, which was awful, with the fish glob on top being all mushy as if it had been pre chewed and spit on top of the roll. n nI ordered the seared big eye tuna. The risotto it came with was outstanding, the tuna was, in a word, awful. The flavor was good, but this was the first piece of fish I have ever had that couldn't be eaten because of sinews running through it. I had to cut away over 1 3 of the meat because it couldn't be cut or chewed. n nTo top it off, the service was poor at best. The staff was friendly, but our water ran out numerous times, our server was hard to find, and the coup de gras was that they completely forgot my order. My wife had completely finished both plates of her sushi well, she didn't eat the lava rolls because they were awful and my tuna still hadn't arrived. When our server finally walked by after 25 minutes not exaggerating, we watched the time and asked she went to the kitchen and came back explaining the kitchen was ""backed up. "" Considering I ordered a dish that required all of 2 minutes to cook, I wasn't buying it. The manager walked by and I said something to him, he went in the kitchen and came back about 2 minutes later with my dinner. Both the manager and server apologized but THAT WAS IT! Not so much as a coupon for discount next time, or my entre being comped, nothing. I understand restaurants make mistakes, but own up to it, and do something about it. n nNot that I spend a lot of time in Scottsdale, but I can assure you we will NOT be going back.",1
"Hoping to experience this tomorrow. Just wanted to post their hours for Yelpers. Open from noon to ""about 7 30pm """,2
"It's been months and months since the place changed in name from Makinos to Tay yo. What does Tay yo mean? I dunno either. I thought at least a handful of reviews would have been posted by now, but maybe they are being left on the Makino name instead? I'll have to check . nActually when it was named Makinos the food was either hit or miss and when it was miss it was pretty bad and in a rare chance it was good as a Sushi buffet can be. Right at this point in time the food at Tay yo is consistently acceptable. The key is to go at 11 30 for lunch and at 5 30 for dinner. Miss that opening gate and you could be disappointed. We actually go about 2 times a month, which is about the frequency of our Sushi cravings. Also there is a weekly community newspaper that comes and coupon for 3 off on lunch and 5 off on dinner is a nice touch. it helps us go more often because of it . Then again we are usually given a nice glossy card with the same discount when we pay our check, so once you go you should always have active discount card in place. Sushi can be inconsistent in the Valley, but Tay yo is good enough for me. It's not the best there is, but it's well in my acceptable zone. 4 Stars!",2
Excellent service always. Fair prices always. Punctuality always. Reliable always. Over 30 of my real estate clients have used House Doctor Exterminating. Not one complaint ever. Highly recommended.,2
"We tried LUMA in Castle Shannon last night for the first time and were incredibly impressed and don't let the Google picture of the outside fool you it's lovely on the inside, especially the outdoor terrace in back .

"Hung over.hungry and already in grumpy mood. Hoped a good bloody mary on our way out of Vegas would do the trick. We were ready to get out of town and went on the outskirts for our last meal. n nSorry.Paradise.but you are not what you think you are. n nDo not recommend eating here. Drinking beer.yes.watching sports.yes.eating and drinking mixed drinks.NO WAY! It get's one star because I will not go to a Mexican place that charges for chips and salsa.and if the salsa is bad.I'd rather just go to an American Sports Bar restaurant. n nYou have to pay for chips and salsa. 5.99 for a quarter cup of salsa and when we asked for a bit more salsa to go with our chips, we noticed at the end we were charged an extra dollar for the little bit xtra salsa! The guacamole tasted like it came prepackaged and was store bought and not fresh at all. n nCon Food Everything tastes like it came out of a can but you are charged like they grew the tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions themselves! Too expensive for what you get. Ordered the fajitas as those are kind of hard to mess up and yes they were bad! Bad flour tortillas, shrimp was from on of those frozen bags that you get for like 5 bucks in your supermarket frozen aisle. n nPro THIS IS WHAT THE ONE Staple Mandatory STAR IS FOR, guess yelp feels everything is good for at least one thing. What you are paying for is the tv's, decorations, and live sports feed. Do not recommend paying for a drink that is mixed just go for the bottled kind. It is a much better value and at least you know what you are paying for. n nTaco Bell with my 42 "" Flat Screen TV and Surround Sound System at home is a much better experience. n n ",1

What happened? It used to be so good! I think the Keirland location is better. The Vegas rolls seemed pre made and reheated. Service is hit or miss. The last server really slow when they weren't even busy.,1
"Tonight I went to Jade Palace. We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace. Besides the food tasting delicious, the service was really good. My ice tea was constantly refilled, and dirty plates removed promptly. It's always a nice surprise when you get both good service and good food. Definitely, try the egg rolls!",2

"This place is certainly unauthentic. I'm a salvadoran so i can tell you this place is no good. I Came here recently trying to give them a last chance before deciding to never return. Well this is what i get . After having one of their greesy, unacceptable version of a pupusa I got food poisoning . I spent all night on the bathroom floor crying in pain . Yeah I'm not returning. By the way PUUSAS ARE NOT FRIED THEY ARE GRILLED! They just don't make them right here they use too muck oil ! You want real pupusas just hit my grandma up!",1
"Whoa! Who knew that they had a cool creative spot in Vegas? There are various rooms galleries with cool art and it was fun exploring the place. It looks like there are some office space that are rented out by various artists. I would've expected to see a place like this in the Arts District of DTLA, not in Downtown Vegas. There is even a coffee shop on the first floor, so you can chill out with a beverage. A true gem of Vegas.",2
I've been eating here since the mid 80's when it first opened. Always the best fajitas I've ever had.,2

"The drink specials are good. The atmosphere and decoration is awesome. n nThe service B L O W S. Our server was exceptionally horrible. Who takes away someones empty beer in the middle of the meal and doesn't ask if they want another? Thought she'd just come back with one but instead she didn't come back. Had to flag her down to get a bill and go find her to cash out. I'd like to go back to the downstairs and sit at the bar to eat and see if the service can be better because I really wanted this one to be good. Oh yeah, and the upstairs really smells bad. Did anyone else notice that one?",1
"The drinks are humongous not a good thing , and the food is mediocre. I guess it's a slight step up from fast food, but for the price it isn't worth the trip.",1
"Two stars for a wide selection and offering delivery service to my area. Portions are a bit small and quality a little blah for the price. Also, my experience with their fried food has been hit or miss. I had the best spring rolls on my first order. Delicately crispy, not greasy indicative of a skilled hand, the right oil temp and just the right amount of time in that oil. Unfortunately, two subsequent orders resulted in the same soggy mess which one can get anywhere else in town. I'll still use them for delivered food a couple of times a year and on the off chance that the skilled fry cook returns but really prefer to go elsewhere for my Indian, Thai and Chinese fix.",1

The bright airy interior ginormous tree and large frosted glass windows welcome you into food lovers utopia! n nLet's talk food! Sumo Maya roll to die for with its spicy tuna, crispy rice, fresh micro greens and wasabi cream drizzle! What's an Asian restaurant now a days without edamame? I'm sure that's what your thinking. Wrong this edamame is unlike any around! They cook it on the wood fired grill gives it the smokey flavor, then lightly toss it in a miso butter! Delicious! Bacon guacamole, salmon ceviche, New York strip, muscles in a coconut lime broth!

"As other review s have pointed out, this location has seen frequent turnover and there's no way I can see Thirsty Cactus making it where Uncle Bears Tio Oso's failed. I haven't met the new owners but I can only guess that they when they were younger they were tormented by dogs carry large helpings of reasonably priced food Thirsty Cactus has taken down all the dog pictures from the previous concept yet didn't put anything else up in its place! Dogs are also now banned from the patio area. In its place are no new decorations and the menu is at a much higher price point than before. I had the skirt steak which was recommended to me very good but a small portion of actual steak but would not go back.",1
"My husband I love sushi I am originally from Japan and we love revolving sushi restaurants. We've been to Teharu and Sushi Station before and really enjoyed them. So when we saw the deal on Livingsocial, we bought it 15 for 30 right away. n nBefore going there, I checked out the reviews on Yelp and found many people said sushi there is expensive. So we are sort of prepared. And yes, it was expensive. We went there for Sat lunch. There were few more groups at the conveyor counter. There were differently priced plates from 2.75 to 4.50 like Teharu and Sushi Station. But most of the dishes on the conveyor are on 4.50 plates and only California roll is 2.75. And edamame and gyoza are 3.50. At Teharu, a plate starts at 1 and there are many types of sushi on the 1 plates. n nThe variety was very low too. There were only 5 types of rolls which are all very similar , tuna, salmon and 4 other types of dishes on the conveyor. Nothing like philly rolls, spider rolls, eel, etc we are familiar to. Way less than other revolving sushi restaurants. The conveyor area was very small and there were more seating at tables. So I think they expect us to order mainly than eating from the conveyor. n nThe quality of fish is better than other revolving sushi restaurants but it's still average. n nWe stuck to the conveyor as that's the whole reason we drove all the way to Chandler from central Phoenix and we know much better normal not revolving sushi restaurants in and near Phoenix. n nSo we do not think we will ever go back to Sushi Eye in Motion. If we want to go to a revolving sushi restaurant, we will definitely go to Sushi Station and for good sushi and Japanese deserts, we will go to Shimogamo. I like the sushi counter at AJ's on Camelback better as they have a real Japanese sushi chef who chooses fresh fish.",1
Had a terrible experience the food was mediocre and the service was terrible. We ordered cocktails and I asked for Vodka and recieved gin and the same happened for 2 others in our party. One person ordered a burger and it came out undercooked and when she sent it back the waiter threw a fit and then did not bring her another meal. At the end she had to tell him not to charge her for her meal I had the trout and it was alright but the whole experience overshadowed the food. This was not worth the money.,1
The food was delicious! I recommend this place for anyone that's looking for great tasting organic Mexican food. Thanks for the great customer service Kai.,2
"Really loved the atmosphere, it was so calm and nice in there. One thing that bothered me was the fact that we each got one bread bun, and that was it. I wanted more. That bread was delicious. I'm bitter about that. Fast service, nice waiters and waitresses and yummy food!",2
"The only reason I give this place a 4 instead of a 5, is they're portions. They pile the rice and beans, which are delicious and especially the Jerk Fried Rice but the actual entree items are quite small. I have been going here for years and it has always been great never a bad meal. For the price I just think there should be better portions",2
"OK, We've been here before, and the service was good, the food was good, but not the comfort food seafood that We have yet to find since Fosters closed it's doors. n nWe ate at Wildfish last night, and what a nightmare. No special occasion, we are just dieting and go out once a week for a really good meal. We were seated promptly, as we had a reservation, but I had to make an 8 30 reservation and when we arrived, the place had a lot of empty space, so I think we could have come sooner. n nOur server was a nice guy, he brought us our drinks and with his good description of the Lobster dish, sold me on it. After about 20 min wait, he finally came back and took our order. Both Entrees we wanted were out, so we had do decide on something else. OK, it was late, so I can understand that. n nHe notified us that there was only one serving of the Chilean Sea Bass, So I asked for that. He ran to the kitchen to reserve that, then promptly came back for our order. They serve it two ways. Roasted with a lemon sauce, and Hong Kong Soy Style. I ordered it Roasted. My wife ordered crab stuffed shrimp, and we ordered a side of Asparagus. n nAfter our Bisque, about 30 min later, out came the Sea Bass, incorrectly prepared HK style, and the stuffed shrimp. I told the food runner that it was the wrong dish, he said, OK, I'll fix that. I asked how they can fix it if that was the last sea bass they had? n nThe Manager came out and apologized. Apparently they had more ""in the back "" What does that really mean anyway? It all comes from ""the back. "" He was really a nice guy. 5 min later, the food came out, and the bass was correct, but my wife's entree was not really very hot. They should have left it for her to start. They also brought the wrong side. Really? n nDon't get me wrong, the food was really good, and I think the service snafu was just a comedy of errors, the Manager came out again and comp'd a very large portion of our meal. He really handled it as best he could, but what prompted me to write this is that a very similar mixup happened at the table next to us. They had the misfortune of having the most obnoxious loud talking server in the place. They had to re order stuff that they were out of. Also, he played off bringing out the wrong steak as a good thing. Really? n nBad service really kills an otherwise good restaurant, we have seen some with good food, but bad service, close their doors Metro Brasserie, for instance so I write this in hopes the wait staff of the world will pay attention and at least take this advice WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN at the table, and pay attention to detail.",1
"Vegas cab drivers know a sucker when they see one. They see them all day, everyday, on the strip. They're called tourists. Only suckers, people who don't care about money, and those too afraid to rent a car and drive in Vegas use cabs. I happen to fall into the last category and so I have no choice but to succumb to highway robbery. n nIf you must use cabs to get around Vegas, it's best that you know the shortest route before you get in that cab. More than once I've had a cabbie take me onto the freeway to get from point A to point B when it was really, really clear that it was only a rouse to rack up my rate. n nThe ride from MacCarran to Fremont was 50 with tip and the credit card fee! n nIt's also important to note that if a cab driver doesn't consider your destination to be worth while money wise , he'll pretend he doesn't know what place you're talking about. I had two cab drivers in a row from this company do this. The third agreed to take me where I was going and then fessed up that is what the others were doing as if I didn't already know . Funny thing was, we were going from Fremont to a location right behind Fashion Show Mall. 22 before tip AND you're right on the strip to pick up new riders and that's not good enough? Ugh.",1
"I'm not a big cupcake fan but found theirs to be quite tasty and creative. A tad on the sweet side but you don't go into a place like this expecting to lose weight. Apparently the 2 pastry chefs like to experiment with various flavors so you may not get the same cupcake 2 consecutive days. The cupcakes are also very visually appealing. The only problem I had was that the cupcakes were on the small side for ""gourmet' cupcakes, especially at those prices. Overall, a pleasant surprise and worth the treat every once in a while.",2
I went to total nutrition the other day to check them out after my work out . Only one employee in the store and he spent 10 minutes talking to another customer and ignoring me . I asked him the price of something and he said he will said he will get to me in a minute. Five minutes later he still talking to other guy about sports and never helps me. While leaving he says God bless you have a good day goodbye all in a very sarcastic manner. I wait 15 minutes for some guy to sarcastically ridicule me as I walk out the door because I don't want to wait any longer for him. Not very good customer service at all nothing in the entire store is Price I do not trusters where nothing is priced . I'm from California a lot of stores do that out there that way they can push their home brands on you and tell you how bad the national brands are. I definitely do not recommend it.,1

Perhaps that is why Ladies Night never took off you only have time for one glass of champagne before it's last call. Also, the waiter started turning off the lights at 9 30.

"I thoroughly enjoy this library, and feel as though it offers many wonderful services, especially despite many city wide budget cuts. The building itself is very modern in architechture, and has wonderful open floors with great floor to ceiling windows. Taking a trip to the top floor and watching the city from the north and south facing windows can be an afternoon of entertainment in and of itself. They also have wonderful individual workstations on the top floor, a very accommodating teen center on the fourth floor, and a very large children's area on the first floor. As far as services go, there are plenty! The reading program for kids is now offered throughout the year not just in the summer anymore , there is the culture pass program tough to get tickets, but cool that they're free , assistance with college applications and financial aid, classes to learn basic computer skills free! , free internet access on their computers or with your own wi fi , and a really cool summer schedule for kids that is also free! I also really like the email alerts that I now receive, reminding me when my books are due this has saved me from late fees many times! If it strikes your fancy, there is also a cafe and a small bookstore, though I have never frequested either. n nSo why not five stars? Well, in the end, this is a library, and place to find books and other materials, and considering this is supposed to be the main hub for all the Phoenix Public Libraries, I sometimes find they are lacking in some of the information I am looking for. Also, while I understand that money is tight everywhere right now, the hours are sometimes less than convenient.",2

"Wow, I'm so disappointed in this spa! I think maybe I was expecting too much after reading all the glowing reviews here. n nI came here on a Saturday morning around 9 AM, and no one was really at the front desk to check me in, give me a robe, etc. A worker was rushing around and finally yelled over her shoulder, ""Sorry, I'll be right with you, we're SUUUUUPER busy today. "" Um, not the most relaxing. I just paid upfront 230 dollars for my 70 minute hot stones massage and arrived an hour early to relax and get into the ""spa zone "" and you are NOT helping. n nAfter a super quick tour of the facilities by the same busy woman, along with 3 other women loudly speaking an eastern european language and largely ignoring the tour guide, making it hard for me to hear, she shoves a too small robe in my hands and bolts. I change into my robe, wander into the relaxation room, and try to get some of this AMAZING white peach tea I've heard about. Except, there was literally NO ONE around to make it for me. n nNow, I would easily have made it myself, but it was loose leaf tea and there was some weird contraption that I didn't know how to work, and the tour lady had said that there was a specific tea person who would helping me. So, I just had a glass of the iced tea, which was ok, but not really what I wanted. n nOne thing that really bothered me was that there was only bottled water and paper cups for the tea obviously, this spa does not care very much about being sustainable. I think I drank at least four 12 oz bottles of water after my treatment to flush out my toxins. I hope that they recycle, but it didn't look like it since everything went into the same bin. Why the lack of simple iced water in a pitcher, and real glasses mugs for the tea both hot and cold tea were served in paper cups. Blech. n nSo after a few minutes of sitting in the relaxation room, I realized that I was not feeling the relaxation coming on. Reason the SCORES of people shouting in a caucaphony of languages, along with the loud bachelorette party screaming and making jokes. At every other spa I've been to, there is an attempt to make the space feel serene. No staffer ever told anyone to quiet down, and the result was really disappointing. n nThe only reason this spa is getting 2 stars one, my massage was lovely and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Two, I loved the facilities the different rooms and spa baths were great it was just such a shame that the atmosphere was not at all relaxing, and that the staff felt too busy to help me. n nOverall, I feel like this spa just didn't want to turn away anyone's money hence the overcrowding atmosphere. Perhaps they have also cut down on the number of staff to assist you. The result is quite disappointing. n nFor the price I paid, I should have saved my money and gone to a more low key but relaxing place. It's Vegas though, so just remember that all those gimmicks all the pools, etc. will cost you extra, but may leave you feeling empty.",1

The fettuccine was over cooked and the sauce was under seasoned. For a Saturday night at 8, it should still be hopping, yet the atmosphere was dead which is funny since its in a casino. ",1
"This week I went to a beautiful Christmas dinner at Field Edinburgh. It has a cosy, romantic feel to it and only had a few tables. The staff like Rachel in the front of house are so friendly and helpful, and Chefs Richard and Byron are always experimenting with great new creations. n nI first went to Field over a year ago for a friend's birthday. I had a beautiful, rich dish of pork belly with black pudding gnocchi which was divine. For dessert, we discovered the 'jaffaron' a delicious and creative Jaffa cake Macaron. n nI went with friends to Field this week for their set Christmas dinner menu. The choices for starters included oxtail ravioli, duck liver p u00e2t u00e9, tomato and Aubergine soup, and mackerel. I wasn't overly keen on any of them honestly. For the main I was really eager to try the chicken with chestnuts which was excellent. For dessert I had the pistachio layer cake with homemade cherry ice cream. Everything was absolutely beautifully presented but not as flavorful with pistachio as I would have hoped. n nI always have a lovely time at Field, and it is a beautiful place with high quality, excellently presented food.",2
"The customer service is awful. They did not return my calls. My furniture was delivered 3 weeks later than promised, they gave me a one day option and 2 hour window for delivery and did not work with me regarding delivery time even though the furniture delivery was much later than promised. They needed to come back to repair it after they delivered it.",1
BEST TATTOO SHOP IN LAS VEGAS. With their unique different variety style of work this place is by far my favorite. The guys are super friendly and does such amazing quality work. Love this place,2
"If you have time to wait in the long line and cash to pay for the moderately overpriced food, this isn't too bad. Since I was feeling diet y and would rather spend money on my new christmas cash clothes, I just got a panini sandwich and water for 11 . Pretty good, shared my sista's salad, slightly better than what you can get for 6 at another small Italian owned place. Great sidewalk viewing for all the Cindy McCains walking down the sidescape.",2
"We waited on the slow line about 1 pm after we saw the american deal. Maybe I missed the fine print but I'm thinking it was a bait and switch. After waiting so long to just get in we stayed and had the french onion soup. delicious. The pepper steak was ordered by me and my friend and it was cooked the perfect medium rare. Soft, juicy,pink and not a lot of blood. Spice wise we both thought it was bland. Peppercorns were shoved around it and that was it. It was way overpriced and the waitress was nice but I wish I had just left or went with a sandwich and got out if there.",1
"Yogurtland is one of the better yogurt shops in the valley. n nA few indicators of a good yogurt place n Always packed n A variety of flavors that swtich out frequently n A family friendly environment n. and Yogurtland meets all of these standards. n nThe only con for Yogurtland is that sometimes the machines are a little dirty, becasue the staff is usually in the back room or behind the counter, other than that it is great. n nI like how they let you do your own samples, becuase some other local yogurt stores don't let you do that. n nAlso, I like that they have two sizes of cups available 16 ounces, and 20 ounces. n nWhat i LOVE about Yogurtland is their tart and their sprinkles but they call them ""Jimmies "" . Their tart is the best that I've had at any yogurt store in the valley. It is refreshing, and sweet, while tart at the same time? , and doens't give your mouth that dry feeling that some other tarts do. Also, their sprinkles are to die for. I don't know where they buy their sprinkles or what they do to them, but they are the perfect consistency and for those of you that are less familiar with sprinkles some come crunchy and the others come soft and Yogurtlands are the softest of soft! Definitely a win for me!",2
"Wacky Wednesdays 1 2 off pizza it's great .any other day I like the family special 1 large one topping pizza 2 one doz of wings 3 whole hoagie 4 gallon pop. It's great now if your in the mood for a specialty pizza try the chicken, bacon, and ranch pizza it's gooood.",2
"I have to say this is the best sandwich I have had since I have been in Pittsburgh, hands down. n nI had the Tutti and I was shocked when I received it, it was huge! They offer you enough meat for the sandwich to be a meal unlike nasty Subway, which is pretty much the same price and it is all fresh. n nNot much more to say about a great sandwich!",2
I went here tonight after hearing good things about the place. I was very disappointed. The food servings were large but the food itself was not very good. The Chicken Fried Steak had no real taste at all. It was just bland. The pork chops were good but not great. Salad just a salad and the bread was cold. I do not think I will be going back after spending 46 dollars for so so food. Very disappointing.,1

"Our family went to celebrate a birthday with an Indian dinner there were 6 of us in our happy group. We have been going to the Maharaja for years, to enjoy the lunch buffets, Valentines Day, birthdays etc. Tonight the food was good, but the service was an issue. n nTo start, we could see that the staff had changed. The service took a long time, even though there were only 5 tables with customers and six wait staff. The server did not understand English well enough to properly place the order, so there was extra wine for one person. Also, the glassware and flatware were spotted, with some that needed to be sent back. n nThe service had really changed for the worse. The server would clear one dirty plate, then wander off, return five minutes later to get another and so on. The Manager or owner really needs to train the staff. They were all working, but seemed unclear as to who was responsible for what duties. n nWe also ordered ice cream and a special birthday dessert, while very tasty the service was vey slow, at least 10 minutes from the time the ice cream was ordered to served. n nWhat really put us over the top was when they refused to accept their own 50 Gift Certificate that they sold to me in June towards the 160 bill not including tip . It had only been approximately 6 weeks. Apparently, this location has been sold. The old owners still own the location on Odana Rd same name , but not this one. Therefore, they would not accept their own gift certificate and told us, we could use it at Odana Rd. nInterestingly, they still kept the Best of Madison sign on the door for the old ownership, they will need to take this down. Again, we were surprised at the business decision about their own gift certificate.",1
"My second and third times to this place really let me down. Service was non existent and the food was poor compared to our fist experience. I know this is on the water, but I really didn't appreciate people coming in with no shirts men and no shoes. What a shame, this could be a real gold mine. We'll go back just to have a beer and watch the boats.",1
"Went here at sunset, was cool to see. A good place to relax.",2
"Very clean hotel.jacuzzi is very huge,shower and bathroom are huge and clean.view was nice although it was the back of the hotel.lobby was nice and valet was great.now the bad.tv kept freezing every few hours for several minutes at a time.we were on the 55th floor and heard the train EVERY night all thruout the night loud and clearly.im a freight train engineer for u.p. and thats the last thing i want waking me up away from work,so that makes 6 nights of broken sleep all night,never good.i would not stay here again as we all know in vegas most people are in their hotel only to sleep.",1
"Fr u00fcher habe ich sehr gerne bei ARLT eingekauft die Preise waren ok, der Service stimmte. Was aber inzwischen mit dem Personal geschehen ist kann man nur schlecht nachvollziehen. nWurde man fr u00fcher beraten, so wird man heute gef u00fchlt mit dem erstbesten Ergebnis abgespeist.

I also think their poppyseed hamentaschen are to die for. Sometimes I'll make a detour on my walk home just so I can peak in their window to see if they have any day old hamentaschen left. They're sold a discount and they make my freakin' day.,2
"This place has some of the best pizza I have ever had. I love the decor and how friendly the staff is. The best part about this place is the cocktails. I do not usually drink mojitos but the one at the parlour will blow your mind. The restaurant does tend to get busy at lunch and dinner times, and their parking in back is pretty limited, so I would watch out for that.",2
"So disappointed! I just recently had my first Whopper and let me tell you I loved it. I went to this location ordered 2 Whoppers, 1 Fish, 1 Chicken, 1 large Fry and 1 large Onion Ring. You would have thought I ordered the entire store. I made my order at 10 am and did not leave till 10 30! What a joke. n nThe asst. manager Lazaro was so checked out. He was not leading his team, the store was filthy, food everywhere. Not one person in the store seemed to care about anything. They screwed up my order 3 times and had to re make it. n nLazaro was looking at me like I was the bad guy. Get it together people, it is just Burger King. Everything gets cooked the same way every time. So after this long awaited wait, I finally got home. Could not even finish this food, it was the absolute worst thing I have ever tasted. I think they were using old meat. I had to toss in the trash because of my fear of food poisoning. n nThanks a lot Lazaro for your great leadership skills. NOT! Most people would be thrilled to have a job in this economy and do it with pride. I will never return to this location. You have most likely ruined my Whopper experience.",1
Never go here for dinner. My family went here for dinner and it took them 45 minutes to bring our food while the people around us who came much later were instantly served. The staff quality was bad too. The waiter dropped my food and spilled my water on me and all I got was a sarcastic sounding sorry. The food was alright but Passage to India closeby is much better in terms of customer service and quality.I will never eat at Persis again.,1
"Has alot if choices on the menu, even if your a vegetarian. Food is good, but honestly that should be expected here in Vegas. Good for a nice somewhat cheap lunch.",2
"Do not trust these people! They sold me an extended warranty on my TV and now claim that it was valid from the date of purchase. Why would I double cover a manufacturer's warranty? Shame on you for lying and stealing my money! After thousands in purchases from family and friends, we will no longer do business here!",1
"I have never left a review on Yelp before but I was inspired to download the app just to warn people about this place. I wish I would have looked at reviews before I came here today. I used to make the drive from north scottsdale, all the way over to glendale just for this restaurant when I was 16 to let's say 20. I am now 30 and decided to mix things up with my girlfriend and try my favorite from when I was a kid. This place has gone down hill in a hurry. I laughed audibly out loud when I read the review previously written saying they think it changed hands. I had just done a Google search on my phone to see if they sold out. The owner must have gotten a new manager or food provider. The food made me sick. I ordered whole wheat pasta with the reduced fat marinara and it came out like a bowl of soup. We tried the 4.50 portobello mushroom appetizer and that was like a hot sponge soaked in vinager. The bread is soggy and nasty. I was embarrassed to take my girlfriend here.",1
"The neighborhood is very sketchy and the plaza where this restaurant is located is even sketchier. The owners, however, have done an admirable if not cheesy job of decorating the storefront of Sunshine Cafe. n nOnce you walk inside your senses are immediately assaulted by the smell of a greasy spoon diner coupled with the noxious colors of the 1970s. The artwork on the walls is kitschy it reminds me of what some might call ""classy. "" n nThe food is surprisingly good! I had the French Toast they serve breakfast all day , while several others at my table had a BLT, and someone else had the fish and chips. Everyone really enjoyed their food. And for some reason, their bacon tastes REALLY good here. The staff is friendly and provide good service. Our party of six was in and out in under an hour. n nIf you aren't looking for fancy, and in the neighborhood, I definitely would recommend you visit. It's a fun atmosphere that looks as if it has been forgotten by time. The prices are excellent and the food is better then what you'd get in a similar place like IHOP or Blueberry Hill.",2
"I was ok with this place for a while. The food is ok for the value. n nHowever, lately management is really not doing his job. Orders take forever to be served when there is literally no one in the restaurant 25 30min and overall, customer service is getting worse. n nToday I went for late lunch with colleagues. We had the discomfort of being present in a verbal fight between Joe I guess THE Joe and one of the cooks. What a shame. They were arguing in the middle of the super small dinning room! . n nThe one thing that really ground my gears thou was that I order a spaghetti with meatballs and after waiting for half an hour I got my plate with no meatballs. After a couple of minutes the server brought me a cup with 1 meatball. ""Ill bring you the other one in a couple of minutes "", he said. Five minutes later, with my plate almost finished, he brings me the other sad meatball in a small cup. I guess it was some kind of deconstructed italian cooking experiment.",1
"While there are some good items on the menu, the short answer is dine with caution. I would suggest dining here only out of convenience or perhaps happy hour. n nNachos appetizer is great! They include generous helpings of everything you would want. n nSteak Fajitas are abysmal. The quality of the steak was so low, that they should finely chop the steak Filberto's style pre chewed . For the price your paying, you will feel robbed. n nThe service was poor. The only person who seemed to care about what was going on was the Mexican in charge of chips service. I saw him frequently checking the dining room status. Unfortunately for us, the same attention was not paid by our waiter to our water or beer service. Waited 10 minutes after chips to receive drinks. n nThe ambiance well decorated and remodeled from what it was prior. Good looking interior. We unfortunately were sat by a group of stay at home moms listening to a sales presentation for a weight wrap. While slightly hilarious, I would have expected any self respecting business owner to realize how destructive to other patrons dining experience multiple 40 year old women standing and giving weight band sales testimonials would be.",1
"Very pricey dinner, but well worth it, I think. We ordered the seasonal discovery menu without wine pairing , which consisted of 10 courses. I loved all of the dishes save for a couple which weren't bad, but just not my ""taste. "" n nL'Atelier has a great setup and atmosphere very noisy and lively. If you're looking for candlelit romance with white tablecloths and suit jackets, go next door to its sister restaurant ""Robuchon "" just be prepared to pay twice as much . Most of the seats are situated at a counter around the kitchen so you get to see the chefs in action. With the skill and precision they employ, it's almost like watching a doctor performing surgery. The chefs also serve you themselves and provide the details of each dish.",2
"Average Mexican food served in a Vegas style setting. n nWe have been eating here for years during baseball Spring Training and other sporting trips. The food is REALLY average and pricey. The place is usually filled with seniors since it is quiet unlike some of the more rowdy margarita bar places Camarone's, El Torito, etc. . The ambiance is pleasant enough with a Cesar's Palace fake sky ceiling, but at best is a ""safe "" place to eat with no real endearing qualities for food or service. If you're not inclined to be adventurous, it is safe, but that's about it.",1
"Hopeless service, underwhelming burgers. no thanks.",1
"If you like southern cooking, don't miss this place. The shrimp and grits were delicious",2
Soooo thought I was going to be in for a big meal. In for a big disappointment. Tuesday night. 6 people on the entire restaurant and they're OUT of 10 oz steaks. REALLY? ? Didn't even offer to upgrade up to 12 oz at 10 oz pricr. Bunch of CRAP. We left. STILL HUNGRY,1
"Wife and I visited at 5 30pm on a Tuesday. Headed into bar for drinks and apps. Initial impression was positive big space with comfortable seating. Then a 10 minute wait for a server to approach us. Then only after we asked hosts if there was table service and was told that the waitress visiting with patrons seated at the bar was our server. Tasha, as we learned her name to be, came to serve us only after being approached by host. She took our drink order and the drinks were delivered another 10 minutes later by a manager without requested garnish blue cheese olives and no napkin. A while later Tasha reappeared and asked how were our drinks to which we responded no garnish no napkin no recognition of bad service by Tasha. She asked our appetizer order we said we changed our mind in large part based on bad service, also because 4 of 5 offerings were seafood no beef based app in a steak house! . n nTasha comped our drinks. We left and went to rival Andiamos steakhouse at The D. Spent 100 on drinks and appetizers that were delicious and service was excellent! Oscars needs to get their act together on service standard.",1
"Chino Bandido Takee Outee is a family business that I have eaten at for over 20 years. They have 2 locations, 19th Ave Greenway in Phoenix and Chandler Rd. Dobson in Chandler. I grew up near the Phoenix location and was addicted to their version Jerk Chicken and Pollo Diablo from first bite. When their food is fresh demonstrates the diligent quality control that the owners intend, it is a gem of an experience. n nI was thrilled when they opened Chandler, as I now live there. Eve Frank owners were around often in the beginning and it was just as wonderful as the original. Since the first year, however, the quality has really declined from the flavorful, made to order, quirky food that landed them on Food Network's, Diners Drive Ins Dives. n nYesterday we were craving the TJ Veggie Quesadillas. This flat, bland, lettuce quesadilla was a far cry from the salad veggie packed quesadilla with seranno peppers. The Pollo Diablo in its intended form is one if my favorites. It lacked the attention that makes it so good. The garlic tasted burnt and it tasted as if it had also sat. I also ordered the Saturday special, Bean Tostada. While the black beans seem to be an infallible recipe, they loaded my poor 3 inch corn tortilla with a soup bowl of beans. I tried every which way to eat it and could not. I returned it and asked for another, then understood why the 1st had a pool of beans. The corn tortilla could not be bit, cut, or torn because it was so tough. My husband wanted to try something new and went for Chili Relleno. The Chili nearly disappeared among the greasy 1 2 "" thick cracker crust. His Gringo Chicken was good though. He use to get the Machaca often, however he tried several times in lthe last year and has decided not to anymore because it was often mushy. My son's Teriyaki Chicken was good. The cookies were wonderful, chocolate volcanoes cooked perfectly soft. The daily cookie is the snickerdoodle, which is fine. n nThe 2 stars are in recognition that I love their Refried Black Beans Volcanoes, and the Jerk , Teriyaki Gringo Chicken are fairly consistent. It lacks the finesse for why they developed a cult like following to begin with Quality unique food. n nI will make a trip to the original location soon to see if they have upheld the beautifully simple, yet unique integrity of Eve Frank's vision. I hope enjoy a perfectly glazed piece of Jade Red Chicken in all it's balanced sweet spicy glory rather than the gloppy stagnant stuff Chandler dished out to me a few months ago . I will post the outcome of that visit soon.stay tuned. I am not giving up on them yet.",1
Jason at the front desk was super friendly. The valet staff was polite and helped with our bags. BUT we left a wallet in our room and checked out. We went back an hour later and guess what. NO WALLET. The maid just came up on 1500. The hotel was a great deal but when you get jacked you can only leave 1 star,1
"I first tried this place when they did a ""test "" meal prior to opening. I wasn't impressed then and I'm not now. The food is mediocre at best, the service not even that good. Even the iced tea is awful. And you could perish of thirst waiting for a drink refill. I got a cobb salad, and it didn't even come with a roll, bread or cracker. There are plenty of other places in the Desert Ridge area that deserve patronage. Skip this one!",1

"Booked a one way airport pickup to out hotel, Aria that came in late at night. For some reason the company could to get my email right even after many calls to confirm my reservation even though cutover service was friendly. I like to have confirmations and this bothered me. n nThat being said, when we got off the plane I received a text from our driver, Erik telling me he was down by baggage claim, when we came down the escalator and there he was with a name sign on an iPad and couldn't have been nicer. Erik already had our baggage claim info and helped with out bags to a very well maintained Esclade. Once we were on the way Erik asked if we wanted to stop at a liquor store or anything. Unfortunately we were in a rush to get to an event but since it was my girlfriend's first time in Vegas, Erik had offered to take us on a drive of the strip and the old Las Vegas sign etc. Got us right up into the hotel quickly and made sure we were alls et before taking off. I will definitely use this company again, my only concern is their logistics, shouldn't have been hard to get a confirmation email. Apart form that would have been a solid five stars",2

"I'm not big on steaks but this one do serve very good, tasty ones! We were staying at the Wynn on comp of course! last 12 2 12 5 and decided to try this one out one night. Decor was subdued but when you walk in, you know there's a theatrical feel to it after all, the dining room walls and ceiling folds and lights changes every half hour! Hence, the name Switch Steakhouse wink! . Service was up to par since I did not write this review right when we came back forgive me but I totally forgot what we had for appetizers but I do remember we had no complaints! I do remember what the main meal was filet mignon bone in! with side dishes of wild mushrooms, veggies. Let me tell you that the meat was truly like butter! We also shared lobster tails two medium size ones. Those were delicious also and cooked just right. Needless to say, no desserts for us! too full and happy and yes, we did ok in Vegas I actually did not even spend all my 'gambling allowance' but with 200 left over hubby was ahead by about 300.so overall, a good trip over there. By the way, Wynn is beautiful and the room we had was really nice and large service was very good.",2
"Food is good and the price point isn't too shabby either for Vegas standards. We ordered a bunch of items. The ones that I recommend sticking clear from are the Jidori Chicken, Hanger Steak, and Miso Cod. Oh, and the broccoli side dish too.

"I've stayed in Trump during Thanksgiving 2009. The overall experiences with them were pleasant. Below are some of the Pros Cons. n nPros n n nGrand, Clean smoke free lobby nBecause the hotel does not have a casino, so you don't have to go through the maze like casino full of tobacco smell just to get to the elevator. n nRoom nFor standard guest room, you get nKitchen with Microwave, kitchen sink, stove. nBathroom with Jacuzzi hot tub nSeparate glass door shower area nSeparate glass door toilet area nMirror got build in TV n nRoom cont nThe design of the hotel is that beside the door of your room, you share another outter door with the room next to you. So you got a little common area to share with the room next door, an upscale apartment design I guess. It will be nice if you are staying there with a larger group that you occupied both rooms. n nHotel view nYou get a really nice view since the hotel is one of the tallest building on strip. n nPrice We got 90 night vs. 150 in Wynn or Bellagio. n n nCons n nLocation nAlthough the hotel is considered on strip. But it is actually on Dio Dr. and about roughly 1000 feet from Las Vegas Blvd. nYou can always walk from the Norstrom Which just cross the street of Trump entrance through the Fashion Show Mall to get to the Strip. nBut the Mall close at 10 I believe. nThen if you, like us were taking the Deuce Public bus that go back forth of the Strip then you will have to walk back to the hotel. nOr you will have no choice but to take the cab. n nMandatory expenses nThe hotel charge additional 15 night resort fee for the amenities which does not include Internet Access which, I really need nI think they charge you on parking but I am not sure since I didn't drive, and they only allow valet parking, which you need to tip the valet person every time you need your car. Now consider the location of the hotel, you pretty much always need your car to go out, that's a lot of additional spending. n nTrain horn nBecause there is a railroad next to the hotel, and it seems pretty busy. You will hear the train's horn quite often during day time. This can get quite annoying. I think this only apply to rooms that face the track. n nConclusion nAgain, I think this hotel is really nice, and if you're like me that plan to ""try out "" hotels each time to Vegas, Trump should definitely on the list. n nAlso the location downside will be less significant once the Montreux completed next to Trump On the former ""New Frontier Hotel "" site , then there should be complete link from Trump to LV Blvd.",2
"I heard really great things about this place and I was willing to overlook the fact that it took them 10 minutes to seat me a party of two! when there were about 5 empty tables.except that the food just was not very good. I went on a friday when they have the ""amazing "" chile relleno for their special of the day, and I love a good chile relleno, so I ordered that. Wow, was I disappointed. There was pretty much just a solid mass of cheese inside, it wasn't melted or even warm! The batter was greasy and the sauce was more of a tomatillo sauce. I give them two stars instead of one because the beans and rice were good. Even the chips and salsa were just meh. My dining companion had a chimichanga that just had meat in it, and he said it was pretty boring. n nThe only good thing about going here is that it's right next door to Paletas Betty, which is always delicious!",1
I went here for breakfast and it was the best breakfast I've ever had made to order omelette and every kind of breakfast food you could eat. I made the mistake of coming here for dinner and it was a total waste of money. I was thinking about that great breakfast and got definitely jipped! The selection was not good at all. The food was just okay.,2
"If you haven't signed up for the Fez email updates or their Facebook page, you are MISSING OUT.

When their prices went up a while back we were bummed which is why I can't give it a 5 , but with these deals we can still visit without putting too much of a pinch in the pocketbook. If you like the cocktail seen, they have specials on those too! Still haven't tried the Fez Foodies maybe today?

"There's no way I would've found this place without yelp. Listen to the other reviewers. This is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by businesses you don't typically go to, but the sandwiches are really really good. A tad bit expensive, but worth it in my opinion. My favorite is the 4b I get the large, so it's 10 instead of 9.25 for a regular with a drink . It's a meatball sub with marinara and bacon. I also got a breakfast burrito here once their salsa was great in it , and I couldn't eat the rest of the day. n nOne warning there is a 1 surcharge for credit debit cards.",2
Great location and service but food was fair. We had the short ribs and they were dry and not very flavorful. The ravioli tasted like it had tomato soup on it. The gnocci and lasagna were good though. So was the chocolate tart! Reasonably priced food.,1
"I got the 3 meat plate. I had the pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken breast. The pulled pork and brisket were very good. The chicken was just ok. With the plate you get 2 sides about the size of the small sides at KFC and a roll the was just ok. Slice of pickle and onions which I declined. Of each meat you get about 3.3 oz. I saw them weight it out. It's not much food for 13. My mom got the ribs and loved them. nService is a little slow but that might be because they just opened. nI will eat here again but I will just buy the meat and skip the plate. A pound of meat is 13. I think that is a better value. nYou do get free self serve ice cream. That's always a plus.",2
"Okay place to rest and shower. Aside from that, I wouldn't recommend it. They are doing renovations and it is at a great location, directly accross from Caesars Palace. Harrah's should probably sell this property or do a property exchange.",1
"I've eaten my way through this entire city, from top to bottom, and think this place is probably the best French restaurant in the city, bar none. It's really small but neat, clean, classy, and very intimate. n nWhite glove service where the waiters and staff treat you like ROYALTY, respectful of your choices and delicately making suggestions to improve your experience. No matter how ghetto the wine you bring is BYOW they always have something positive to say about it. n nThe food is absolutely unbelievably amazing. I can't even begin to describe it. I used to HATE French food until I went to L'Entrepont and it turned me around completely. n nAnyways, enough rambling. The best, go check it out.",2
"Good variety, however the food was rather bland and didn't taste very fresh. For 18 I am sure you can do better on a Saturday night! My teenage son complained the tandoori chicken was tasteless, but he did enjoy the naan. Overall, I would avoid this place in the future.",1
It is so delicious that you can't stop.,2

"I was in Vegas for work and had 5 star meals lined up every night. Milos did NOT disappoint. It's not wild and crazy like STK, it's more low key and you can actually hear each other during dinner conversation. It is definitely a more grown up cool crowd. The interior was an expensive buildout and it is comfortable and elegant. I have to say, the Cosmopolitan in general is a very elegant property with artistic finishes. n nThe grilled octopus was amazing! They have a beautiful wine list! I had the Lobster which was spectacular! The seared tuna plate was PLENTIFUL and delicious. I was more than pleased with this choice and it is definitely worth trying. The damage was I think about half as big as the other dinners at Nobu or Michael Mina. My other friend had the salmon and it was HUGE. Everyone I was there with are all pretty much bonafide foodies, and we all agreed this was a great meal. I am going back for this lunch I keep reading about.",2
"We ate here last night before seeing a show at the Mesa Arts Center. Our waitress said it was her first day on the job, she didn't know the menu and had to ask about simple requests. We started with Tom Kha Gai soup and fish cakes. Something about the soup wasn't quite right, it wasn't terrible but wasn't great. The fish cakes were chewy, I wished I had a knife as I could barely cut them with my fork. Our main courses were a green curry with chicken and fish salad. The curry was lacking something, maybe too much curry and not enough other sauce as it was a dark green. Fish salad was not appealing either. My daughter liked the kids meal of chicken satay. Towards the end of the meal I pulled out my phone and looked this up on yelp. I was suprised to see the 5 star ratings. I guess other reviewers got different dishes than I did. I'll be eating the leftovers for lunch, maybe it will be better the day after.",1
"I'm too late! I just found out that the soul food restaurant inside of Phil's yeah I know.sounds unlikely has closed! n nFor about six months Bumblebee Soul Food Company was serving fried chicken, catfish, smothered pork chops etc.and it was great. n nChristian, the ex owner of Bumble Bee is related to Mrs. White of Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe. Between Christian's Bumble Bee, Larry White's Lolos, and the Golden Rule Cafe, this is the royal family of Phoenix soul food. If one of them had a pet that opened a soul food restaurant in Phoenix I would have high expectations upon entering. n nBack to Phil's. Phil's is the closest bar to my house and I wind up there for happy hour a few times a month. I agree with the other reviewers that it is a great little dive bar with friendly regulars. The only drawback to Phil's is the lack of dive bar beers like PBR and Schlitz.",2
"Seriously. What kind of restaurant doesnt have child seats? I didnt stay for the food because they didnt have them. Just looking at the place makes me think it would be a lovely place to have lunch with my other mommy friends. After reading most of the other reviews, I guess I should consider myself lucky that I didnt spend the money.",1
"I do love their 5 pizza and how it is always ready. It is very convenient. The wings are so so, so normally I just go for the pizza. The staff here are always friendly and the service is quick. They always try to ask you to add on crazy bread or wings, but a simple ""no thanks "" does the trick.",2
"Place sucks. I am from Chicago and I know a thing or two about great sandwich's. This place however, does not! They can't even make a simple French dip here. The meat was dry and bland they had the attention span of a fly and the place was empty. I should have known. But it is a local business and I wanted to do my part. My part has been done and I will not eat here ever again. The food is worse then subway. I mean I wanted a great sandwich but what I got was a lack luster sandwich made with bitterness and shame rather then love. And you can tell with one bite. Do yourself a favor get a sandwich down the street at sack's better food better bread and better quality meats for sure and service with a smile. Trust me on this this place is an epic failure. Sorry but jp is bs.",1

"I am gonna agree with a lot of the reviewers that Nathan Burton isn't the best part of the show. The juggling guy was really funny and the showgirls were really hot. I will say that if you are paying for the show, it can be a great value.",2
"I swear every time I go to Raising Cane's I think the workers hate me, because I always put in complicated orders that don't need to be complicated. The first time I asked for just a few chicken strips, without fries and just the coleslaw and texas toast. When it would have been much easier to just order on of their pre set menus. The second time I asked for a party tray of chicken strips and a few cups of coleslaw and texas toast, and again it would have been easier to order one of their preset menus. Sorry Raising Cane's! I need to read your menu next time. n nbut seriously though, that FRIED CHICKEN, TEXAS TOAST, and the SAUCE. SO GOOD.",2
"A really delicious option for meats and cheeses in the Plateau area, this is an old classic of the Main that really shines when it's meat on the street street fest time. But all year round, if you are working or just walking through the area, you can count on La Vieille Europe for a super tasty and fresh sandwich and pastry to go from the counter. This is a chill family run spot so don't bring your stress in, just come and enjoy the savoury and sweet tastes of the old country.",2
"Worst club I've ever been in. n nI went straight to the front of the line with some girlfriends who were VIP but my guy friends were unfortunately stuck in line for over an hour until they tipped the bouncer 100. I guess that's Vegas, but Tryst was sooo not worth the wait or the money. n nMusic was okay. I found the layout annoying, it really took away from my whole experience. Atmosphere was okay, I guess but in my humble opinion, it was far too brightly lit to call itself a night club, with far too many tables and chairs and seating places to call itself a dance club, with far too many people to call itself exclusive. n ni will not be going to Tryst again.",1
I am not sure if I went on a bad day. The burger was raw. The fries are really long and almost too thin so if they are overcooked it has the texture of potato chips. Half the tables where full and the other half was dirty. They did offer to cook another hamburger but I was already running late to an appointment.,1
"Ask how HH Gregg stands behind their stuff. The answer is that after 30 days, it's not their problem. Five month old 2000 fridge has had three service calls, and you can't even request a service call on a Saturday. Call the store. Get transferred to Indiana. Get told, call back Monday. n nUnlike other retailers. HH Gregg seems to be in the business of one and done sales. n nThankfully we had bought some appliances from Queen City too. They've now helped us with the fridge repairs, after HHG ran away from the problem. Point is, if you want sales AND service, go to Queen City instead.",1

"What a great place. I purchased this years Valentines gifts here. Diva ""s mix was my favorite and the Chocolate covered Strawberries were great.",2
Wow. Completely difference experience now from the previous times I have been here. Service sucks. Period.,1
"I love this place. Whenever I'm loafing around and realize I forgot to plan for dinner, this is my go to place. n nThe veggie burrito is awesome, and they really load it up. Anything with the habanero salsa is a hit for me, too. It's fantastic. n nI really like sitting on the outside patio and watching the foot traffic go by on Scottsdale. Surprisingly good music, to my taste, too.",2
"I had not been to this resturant in some time, now I remember why I have not been back. The food is ok, however the atmopsphere is sub par for sure. I had the cuban meatloaf, the meat and glazed yuca were dry, but eitable and fried bananas were obivously from a package. The only thing great was the black beans. n nFor the prices of the food, you would think you would have more then a plastic chair to sit in. One of the people helping to serve food, I think is one of the managers, actually needs a class on how to serve, sorry grasping my glass by the rim is not a proper way to serve a drink. Also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money. The cleaning bottle for the tables was on the same counter as the serving counter mixing area for drinks. n nThey really need a refresher course on food handling. Possibily over due for a health inspection too. I was very disappointed in my experienxe.",1

"We bought a Groupon to India Palace and decided to use it last night. n nWe ordered goat briyani, malai kofta, garlic naan, and mango lassi. n nThe meal started with the typical papadum and chutneys. The tamarind chutney was pretty decent. I'm not a big fan of tamarind, but this was better than the tamarind chutneys I've tried elsewhere. The mint chutney was also pretty good. They also had a pepper chutney which had a nice kick. n nMy wife thought the mango lassi was almost as great as at her favorite Indian restaurant. n nThe garlic naan was good. Not too burnt or chewy which I've found to be the case at many Indian restaurants. n nThe goat briyani was really good. It had a nice mix of flavors and textures. My wife really liked it until I told her it was goat. She doesn't like goat and I ordered it while she wasn't listening. n nThe briyani came with raita which was decent. n nThe malai kofta was also enjoyable. The sauce was very flavorful and the ""vegetable meatballs "" had a nice texture. n nThe service was pretty slow, but overall it was a good experience, and I think I'll probably be back.",2
"The meal was a lot smaller than the picture in the menu. The service was slow every time I come here, I don't know why. It wasn't that crowded and I saw enough waiters and waitresses. If you don't use coupon there are 2 more menus to choose from, it's weird. I probably won't come here again, I like Wildflower bread company better.",1
"So disappointed. I have been a loyal customer to this store since it opened and have seen the decline. One lane open on an extremely busy Friday night? Seriously? Have been there numerous times, different days, different hours and its always the same story. Line of 20 people and one register. If u want to wait 30 to 45 minutes to check out, this is your place. I once waited over one hour in line with one register open on the day before a holiday. When I talked to the manager as to why she couldn't open more registers, all she said is that it wasn't her fault as she doesn't do the schedule. I saw over 10 people walk out the line to complain to her. She could of opened a line herself to help. Sad to say, I have to avoid this Walmart. All it does is piss me off due to the lack of workers and customer service.",1
"I have finally gotten around to giving this place a try. Based on the really good reviews, I figured I would have gotten better. It was just okay for me. The place was not crowded and my server was average at best. My chicken was moist and seasoned decently, beans were not spicy despite that adjective and the plaintains were very chunky, very little flavor. I am impressed that the fountain drinks are under 2 since a numbers of places have raised the price on some sweet tea to over 2. SMH.Did not try the Tres Leches cake and wished I had. I will not say i will not be back, but it is not on my immediate radar for lunch dinner. The meat was seasoned better here, yet I prefer Pio Pio's service.",1
The Club used to be one of our favorites.but lately the food has been going downhill quickly. Sent all 5 of our meals back last Saturday night.,1
The monorail is a ripoff for tourist. A single ride is five bucks for tourists but if you can prove that you live in Nevada you ride for a measly one dollar. A 500 premium for being an out of town sucker.,1

"As far as airports go, this one is really easy to get in and out of. Either way Picking people up, or taking off for fun and adventure, this place is pretty convenient. No complaints here! Nothing even remotely close to the nightmares such as LAX or San Francisco Intl. This place is a piece of cake. Not sure if other airports have these cell phone lots, but this is a new con convenient deal. You park in a special lot with a giant sign that reports when all flights are either in the air or have arrived. You hang out and wait for your friends and family to arrive, THEN you start cruising the pickup area looking for your passengers.",2
"We seemed to walk in right at the dinner rush, so they were very busy but, we found a seat right away. Immediately out server came over and said he would be right with us. nHe came by and dropped off menus. When he got back we ordered drinks, spring rolls garlic noodles. nEverything we ordered was fresh. We got the grilled chicken, ahi tuna and saigon spring rolls. The sauce that came with the saigon and ahi was okay but a little too sweet so we used the curry hoisin sauce that came with the chicken spring roll on everything. nWe liked all the food and drinks. The service was a little slow since it was busy, but not overly slow. We will definitely be back!",2

"Simply beautiful. This place is super sexy. Started at the bar and the bartenders are on it. I was waiting for my guests as I arrived early for my reservation. The music was upbeat and trendy the staff was really good looking but knowledgeable one might assume they are hired for their looks but every one here knows their shit. My guests arrived and we were promptly seated. Tai snapper, Tuna Pizza, this Octopus Dish with a green sauce amazing , and some nigiri, and these king crab hand rolls my favorite as well. Ok so they have a sake girl the know what you've ordered and recommends sake for you. BEST THING EVER! We got WASTED LOL, in a good way. Great view of the Belagio fountains too. n nIt was a memorable experience. The place is expensive, but I felt it was worth every penny and want to go back for my Birthday this year. n n nGreat Job Yellowtail !",2

I had the Red Velvet and that is a hard kind of cake to make dry. I just don't know what they are doing wrong. nCarin had a peanut butter cupcake and it was just flat. nI have also had the cupcakes from Lulu's and Cupcake which I think are generally better, as well as cupcakes from Tammy Coe which is, BTW the way cake is supposed to be . nAs I say, it was a nice evening for stroll and treat, but maybe I should have gone for a gelato, instead.",1
"Just stopped in for some pizza and was so surprised they had white slices. I've been in AZ for 3 years and always miss good New York pizza. I would say their pizza is close to small chain pizzerias if you want a good New York slice try garden pizza in Goodyear but if you want a close to New York small chain ""Mario's pizza "" style pizza an need a white slice fix give Gus a try. Got a special surprise the chef made some tiramisu and let us try it. Absolutely fantastic",2
"Now I've been to Tia Rosa several times and I've always enjoyed the food and Margaritas. I specifically love the grilled peppers and onions you receive with some dishes. That said, last time I was there, I ordered a Vegetarian Burro 12.which is already quite a lot for a Burro filled with beans , and asked to have some grilled peppers and onions put inside, instead of cheese.and then the grilled peppers and onions on the side instead of the beans and rice. My burro ended up costing 18! 3 extra for each addition of the grilled veggies. I could have got a better tasting burrito at Chipotle.actually 3 veggie burritos at Chipotle for 18.and those come with peppers and onions, and Guacamole! n nWhen you spend 60 on Margaritas, and another 80 on food, I would expect them to throw in a side of vegetables.",1
"This location is always quick and friendly. I used to come a lot more often, but I've slowed down considerably. n nI'm just going to go ahead and say it The grilled nuggets are not even worth the calories you save.

Awkward environment, I am not sure I would want to hang out and watch a sporting event there.",1
"Dropped into this mid sized place to try the buffet lunch today. It was too warm inside, but somewhat stylish, the hostess was friendly, and the food looked good, so I stayed. n nI counted 22 food choices, and there was nothing I had ever seen before except the salad, which was like what you see at the Indian buffets. lettuce, quartered tomatoes, cucumber slices, baby carrots, a yogurt dressing, etc. After that, everything was exotic. n nAfter being seated at a small, out of the way table to my liking, I started with what the hostess called soup, but I would call lamb stew, it was delicious!

Does anyone in Afghanistan actually eat this well, except perhaps President Karzai? n nKabab Palace is remarkably quiet inside Yes there were other customers! , and they keep Halal.

"Beware of there Comfort Exchange Policy it is not that comforting. The Sales Manager Shawn is like a used car salesman.

I urge you to shop somewhere else, the after sales service is awful at best.",1
"Excellent service! Very professional from the start. Chantelle was excellent in the scheduling department. The price was given to me over the phone. No hidden fees. When Justin arrived, he put on booties to enter my home. The above and beyond was when he took a blower and got rid of the debris on my front porch. I needed to make a change to my previously scheduled services, and they were totally fine with that. In reference to the cleaning, my chairs were vintage Crate and Barrel my husband had them for many years in his single life They had never been cleaned. They look fabulous!

"yuck! I'd actually rather eat Taco Bell then go to this place again. I got take out from here the other day beef taco and cheese enchilada combo and it was not good AT ALL. The taco shell was store bought cardboard, not freshly fried and authentic and the beef was ground beef, not authentic shredded beef. It also had the tiniest sprinkling of shredded cheese and lettuce. The cheese in the enchilada was all rubbery and solid by the time I got home and ate it mind you I only live 5 min. away . The rice n beans were nothing to call home about. Definitely not authenic mexican food and definitely not worth your money. Will not return!",1

"I purchased a Hollywood Blvd cupcake as well as a Savannah Street treat. The Hollywood Blvd cake tasted like it was purchased at my local Vons not that that is a bad thing, but if I am purchasing cupcakes from a cupcake shoppe, I have higher expectations. The frosting was extremely sugary sort of like you want to barf after eating it. The cake was moist but its flavor was overpowered by the frosting. n nThe Savannah Street cupcake was very blah. The cake had a sort of waxy taste to it and the frosting flavor was much too weak. n nI was glad I had the opportunity to sample, but I will not be driving down Cupcake Lane any time soon.",1
Best pizza in Pitt I've had although occasionally not great. But always fast. They'd be an even greater hit if they delivered.,2
"Salty.bland.totally underwhelmed. I have to admit, I had some expectations since the restaurant is owned by Bobby Flay especially since he's always talking about flavors and southwestern cuisine. But it was just so.whatevers. n nWe ordered the shrimp tamale, queso fundito dip, and the Chile rellano. The shrimp tamale was just alright.nothing special. The queso fundito dip wasnt bad but it certainly wasnt worth 18 bucks. My husband ordered the chile rellano and the crust was so dry and dense. Overall the food was just heavy and bleh. n nThe service was average. The server left us with the dessert menu and didnt come back for 15 mins so by that time I changed my mind and all I wanted to do was leave. Dont believe the hype.",1
"The following is from a hotel perspective n nFrom a hotel room perspective, I believe the rooms at Mandalay Bay to be some of the better ones. I appreciate that the establishment itself is in the mix of things and places that I want to see so that is a plus. In addition they have pretty good food options on location such as RM Seafood, the House of Blues and some lighter fare. They are also connected to a pretty decent shopping area. n nOkay, back to the rooms. The bed is comfortable and the shower bathroom is very inviting. The room was quite clean and did not smell. In addition the space itself was fairly large for a Vegas hotel room.",2
"This banking center is horrible! The staff are nice and pleasant, but the service quality definitely leaves something good to be desired. At the busiest part of the day, they decide to send all but one of their bank tellers on break. So you got one teller, for a line of 7 or more people. And then the hostess says ""thank you for spending you time "" in their bank. This banks management really needs to get their heads out of their little office or where ever it is, and schedule their tellers to work around busy schedules.",1
"I have left my dog here twice and each time is amazing. The price is great and they have webcams so you can view your pet, no extra charge. The staff is friendly and courteous. They are not caged up all day and get to play and roam in their play places and rooms. Highly recommended.",2
"Kim's service on the patio tonight helped to make it a perfect dining experience! Bacon wrapped filet was perfectly cooked, especially the smokey bacon. The delmonico and lobster tail were delicious, and that butter cake dessert. Amazing! No wonder they won an award for it!",2
my girls and i would stop by all the time and would always enjoy our evenings here but this time my bf and i decided to stop by for brunch and wasnt that wowed about it.sure they had a variety of food but it wasnt tasty as their regular dishes.the only good thing was that we left paying 25 for brunch and 8 margaritas which were included in the brunch.oh and cant forget about the homemade tortillas made there.stop by and order from their regular menu you cant go wrong with that.btw the service here is awesome they are all very welcoming and always on top of things!,2
"We tried Smashburger this weekend on our way to the NASCAR race in Avondale. I had heard about it before, but we don't have a location nearby. I was eager to try it out when we found one. n nWe both ordered the Classic SmashBurger the bigger size 1 2 lb patty, 5.99 which came with American cheese I'd go with cheddar next time I didn't notice it came with American when I ordered it , lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion we got grilled instead of raw , pickles and smash sauce. We also each got a side of SmashFries which were thin cut fries, covered in garlic, olive oil and rosemary. The burgers were greasy I like that and very good! They tasted beefy and fresh, exactly how a good burger should be. The fries were a nice change from normal fries and tasted great. If we were in the area, or close to another location, we'd definitely stop by again. I'd like to try to Arizona SmashBurger next time it sounded amazing! n nThe service was fast, attentive and friendly. n nThe only star docking drawback was the price. I think that the burger price should include fries.",2
"I would give this place 5 stars except for the potatoes, very boring. Otherwise the omelets are da bomb. I really love the chicken enchilada one with the yummy red sauce, tortillas and green chiles, as good as it gets. And don't miss out on the house specialty, banana nut muffins to die for, I could probably eat half a dozen of them! They also appear to have killer burgers too. Will have to try one for lunch next time. Our server was nice and helpful. This area is really nice in Vegas too, not too far from Red Rock so its a nice leisurely drive to get there.",2
"Over price. One chicken Katsu burger costs 7.99. No drink or French fries come with it. It was so greasy, no meat, and only fried skin crumble . I am Japanese, and I am sure they are trying to copy Japanese chicken Katsu Katsu is crispy crumble fried , but this is no way to near the Japanese chicken Katsu burger. Horrible price and taste.",1
im gonna have to give it a five everything was perfect ambience wait staff food it was honestly impeccable from the moment we walked in till we left. and it should be cause we spent some cash ha. Now me and the friend got two drinks to start with which i know the are known for their vodkas obviously she got the signature martini bad idea since shes never had a martini but it was drinkable for her and i thought it was ahhhmazing i got a vodka water with lime very smooth and everything you would expect from a good vodka cant remember the name soooorry. We got the five course menu tasting starting with the caviar which i have never had i thought it was good not to fishy and a nice burst of flavor. second course was steak tartar which i also have never had but absolutely looooved i will definitely order again the presentation was beautiful with toast points nice and light not too crunchy. yum yum yum be careful with the anchovies though ha. Then came the salad with a light dressing perfect. The intermezzo was a tiny shot glass with balls of sorbet and champagne poured over it i could have ate an entire bowl of just that! next came my beef stroganoff now this is not your mothers beef stroganoff this is heaven in a bowl filet mignon slices peas baby pearl onions and fresh pasta with a darker sauce rather than cream sooooo good.

"It wasn't what I remembered when I last came here. The food was mediocre and the service wasn't great. It took awhile for my husband and I to get our food, considering the fact that there were 4 chefs in the kitchen. On top of that, they forgot one if our side orders. n nI was a bit disappointed this time around, and in pretty sure my husband washed his hands with the place. Too bad.",1
"I went here based on raving Yelp reviews and was so disappointed. While they have a wonderful atmosphere and awesome cocktails, I was completely underwhelmed, as was the rest of my family. We tried the deviled eggs, which were pretty good, but the rest of the meal was lackluster. Our burgers were all overcooked and dry, and for the price, pretty small. We were so excited to try the meat that is local and fresh, and were so disappointed when it didn't come through. Our waiter was excellent, but nothing else was much to write home about. After spending 75 on 4 burgers, 5 deviled eggs, and a glass of wine, we won't be returning.",1
Overrated. Ate here several times thinking I ordered wrong. Nope just overrated.,1
"Elevate appears to not care about answering their customers. I sent the quoted text below to them two ways via email and a FB message and received NO response for either. In conclusion, not only is their service sub standard and their products mediocre, they feel no need to address their customers comments. n n ""I spent some time at Elevate this evening.had some tea and decided to order some famous Rock Springs pie.

"Called this place and left a message to find out about their classes. After two days did not here from them, so I stopped by to get some info. Got their pricing which was higher then most other places for much shorter classes only 30 mins . But still wanted to find out if it would be a good fit for my daughter. So asked if my daughter could do one trial class. They told me no. but we could pay 50 to try classes for two weeks and get a free uniform. Why on earth do I want to pay 50 and get a uniform for their school if I haven't had my child try it. So my husband and I stayed and watched the classes they had going at that time. Highly unimpressive and no real quality instruction, and no correction for sloppy work. Not to mention they had so much going on in the same room, and people all around being very loud that the kids could not focus. We found a much nicer place, that has high quality Masters and is more interested in training the students then just bringing in money. In fact every other place I talked to offered one free trial class. Too bad all this place is concerned with is making money. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1

"Came here before an ASU game, it was slammed. Sat in the bar at a pub table and was not waited on, had to go to the bartender after 15 minutes and told him what pub table I was sitting at. He was pleasant and under the circumstances, no fault to him the place was spread thin. So he had to come out from the bar to help serve, it was a given our plates wouldn't be picked up cuz the bar was busy. The carne asada tacos were just ok, not much flavor, I did like the beans veggies. Horrible ownership and management for something like this to happen. The service was as bad as I ever had, again not by the server, but there was not waitresses or waiters, never heard such a thing.",1
"Hello yelp, n nI was writing to let every potential student know ""DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL "". n nI started this school because I was interested in cosmetology, after attending the school for 260 hours out of 1800 course, I decided 260 hours was enough, cosmetology is not for me. So I withdrew from the program. n nTurns out, if you want to withdraw from the school, they will charge you an excruciating amount of money, even if you legitimately are not interested in the career. So I went for to 260 hours and they are charging me a whopping total of 7, 500! How doe's that sound? ABSURD RIGHT?! n nFor students looking to get into a career and do not have a large established finance which is MOST students THIS SCHOOL WILL ROB YOU SERIOUSLY. This school sets you up to pay them weather you are satisfied with the school or not.

WHAT A RIP OFF! n nWhen you go to make an appointment everyone who works there will make you feel confident about going, they will warm you up, and SELL you into going. nPssshh, if you do not want to be ripped off for learning how to do hair and makeup, go to a community college that offers the program it is the most reasonable. This school seems well put together when you walk through, they use RedKen and things everything look nice and great, but it is not worth it TRUST ME! The education taught is not worth what you will pay. IT'S RIDICULOUS n nWhen you walk through and they show you around the school, understand and REMEMBER you are like a 20,000 guaranteed paycheck walking through the door, they will do anything to get you to go to school here.

"There's a weird disconnect with me when I walk into this museum to see instruments, whose sole purpose is to be played and enjoyed, displayed for you to stare at while they stay silent. Granted, I'm sure a lot of these instruments are not playable anymore, and they do have stations where you can listen to the TV footage of some but not all of the instruments when they are played. But, I have a constant urge to pluck strings, play keyboards, and pound on drums when I see them laid out like they have been uncovered at an archaeological dig. It's true they do have a ""touch and play "" section on the first floor, but the selection is limited I'd imagine because of the upkeep to maintain constantly played instruments that instrument neophytes are trying out . n nDespite the overwhelming urge to try out the museum exhibitions, there is a great variety of instruments to look at, laid out by region, with information stands to inform you about the history of said instruments. Pretty fascinating to see how different instruments emerge in our cultures and what sounds are deemed ""pleasant "" vs. cacophony. One of the things that I think would make the museum experience more pleasant would be to extend the range of the ear sets they give you, because generally you can only stand in one spot before the headset reception starts to fade, which makes it inconvenient to listen to the instrument samples when there are lots of visitors at the exhibit.",2

Roasted asparagus, yes please. Patio with great people watching, perfect. A glass of wine and coconut cream pie, super.

"This review is for my 2nd visit. My first visit was a 5 , now it's. 2 and here's why. n nSo disappointed! Should have known better to stick with the ones I'm happy with. Brought 3 new clients along my wife and I and had the worst experience! It's so embarrassing when you brag about a place to your friends and ends up a slap in the face with, "" what just happened in there? "" n nBooked for 5 and was separated , that's fine. 3 boys and 2 girls. Me and the gents started first. When 2 ladies walked in, they started giggling and speaking in Chinese as we lie there comfy on their bed. n nVery rude and unprofessional! The 2 ladies talked through the whole freaken session! Really? They were so loud, the music in the background that was meant to make us relax was replaced with their giggles and loudness. n nAnd my girl.fu k! Where so I start?! First she asked me if I was Chinese ? Why? So you can talk smack? She started out very gently.and then out of no where . A vibration of a device happens to be near my head.yes! You fu cken guessed it! A cell phone! Really!?!?! Are you kidding me?!?! n nAt times she paused to reply.who does that?! n nI was this close to chew her up, she was lucky that I was patience enough to let her slide the first few minutes. The massage gotten better and then at times I felt as if she dosed off. Since they close at midnight and we booked at 11pm they must be tired and sleepy . Guess that's a tip for y'all to go early and not make the same mistake I did. n nOverall my experience with her isn't that bad. With the rude texting on the side, least she was quiet and did not join the other two to have a trio conversation. n nOf course I was curious how'd the rest felt about this experience. nOne enjoyed it, the other wanted the massage to be harder, hence, he's pretty built, so I recommend that he should have gone with a guy next time for bigger and stronger hands . His girl was punching him most of the time. n nThat's an indication of, ""my hands are too small and your either fat or too built for me to massage you "" technique. n nOne complained it was too rough should have switch the two . n nMy wife.omg! Unlucky! She had a trainee! My wife said, ""I was there for one hour and my masseuse was being schooled for an hour by another masseuse and I did not feel a thing.

"Oh man. BBQ. A touchy subject for many. A food I feel like I'd only have once a month. When the urge comes calling, this is where I'll be. n nMost important thing about Rollin' Smoke is the way they'll take care of you. These are some great people who care about the food they're making and your happiness when you walk out. With that said, I'll jump into what we had. n n The Outlaw burger. I think calling this the best burger in Vegas is grossly inaccurate. I suspect there is actually better on the menu which I'll have to try soon . The burger patty itself was huge and delicious. The toppings did not do the patty justice. Basically, a colossal pile of sliced cabbage and onion rings. Great as a side, no justice as a burger topping. But hey, that's just me. n n The pulled pork and chicken with bacon wrap. This is my favorite thing here! Soft meats, juicy, and easy to handle. I loved this. So much savory flavor! Very satisfying. The tortilla like wrap it's in might be grilled a bit as it was a bit greasy. n n The trio, with brisket, ribs, and chicken. All three meats were very well seasoned. Loved all the flavors. The brisket was lean, good marbling, but dry. The ribs were large and juicy. The chicken was also perfectly cooked and still juicy. n n Chicken a la carte. Hey, it's chicken! Good flavor and perfectly cooked, as I mentioned. n n Side of beans. So good! Not too sweet or overspiced. I'm a sucker for good BBQ beans. n n Side of mashed potatoes. These were tasty and filled with little extras like bacon and greens. A bit overspiced. n n Berry cobbler included for free with Yelp checkin at the time! . This was an unexpected delight. I expected a dessert packed full of sugar. What I got was just the right touch of sugar in a genuinely home made tasting piece of cobbler. Great crust and flavorful berries without intense sweetness. This is a good item to share with a lot of people. n nI'm definitely going to be back to try another burger but until then. this will be the only BBQ I go to when the craving strikes.",2
"Cafe Rio used to be right near my work at 48th and Ray, but they moved to Gilbert so I am pretty bummed. n nThe salads are amazing, and you should DEFINITELY give one a try.

Outstanding event. The weather was great this year.,2
"I've been nice in the past and given this place 3 stars, knowing that I might eat there again. I don't have that problem anymore. This place is disgusting. Much better sushi at the Harris Teeter next door, and I'm not even sure if the chicken in the ""habachi "" was actually chicken. n nI've been to half priced sushi on Monday's and Tuesday's that were pretty bad, but I just blamed it on old sushi. For me to come in on a Saturday lunch and get pale not torro looking tuna is just not acceptable. With the sushi lunch, you get 5 pieces of sushi and tuna rolls. The tuna in both was barely edible. 3 of the 5 pieces of fish were fishy mackerel or yellowtail. Just stuff they were trying to get rid of. The one piece of salmon I got wasn't half bad. n nMy date ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch. This wasn't chicken. It was weird, pale, and kind of gelatinous. The teriyaki sauce was mostly high fructose corn syrup. Even my dog looked at me kind of funny when we tried to feed it to her. Yes, thats where the food went. n nEven the little fried pieces of wonton with duck sauce were stale. These guys need to figure out if they are a Chinese place, a sushi place, or a Japanese place and just do one thing right. I'm kind of surprised with the rating and that they are even still in business.",1
"Maria was VERY rude to us when we walked in. No greeting, nothing. We walked straight to the bar and the bartender is MIA. Being in the restaurant business for 10 years, I'm never coming back. Horrible customer service and 8 felt like I was wasting their time.",1
"Unless you are 60 and over during the day,then this bar sucks! nGo across the street to the Rib Shop !",1

"The other day, a neighbor told me, his 15 year old dog, passed away two months after Dr. Fisher performed an emergency splenectomy. As he shared the events that led to the his dog's splenectomy, I felt so guilty for never posting a review and sharing my final experience with Dr. Fisher of Oasis Animal Hospital. n nWhen, Dr. Fisher opened Oasis Animal Hospital, we had just moved to the Anthem area from CA, and hadn't found a vet. So we began taking our pets to Oasis, since it was so close to our new house. We were never thrilled with the practice. The office always seemed a little dirty, even though it was new, and the receptionist was always rude. Dr. Fisher always appeared a little grungy with his long dirty ponytail, but he seemed nice enough and in our presence was gentle with our pets and that was what matter most. Luckily our pets were healthy so we only had to go in for annual exams. But as our pets got older, we had to go in more frequently and started to realize that Dr. Fisher and his staff were not meeting our expectations. They seemed to be more concerned with money than the welfare of the animals or people. One day, I witnessed a distraught woman come into the office. She began sobbing and pleading with the receptionist to allow her to see dead pet. Apparently it had died unexpectedly on the operating table. The receptionist refused to allow her to see her pet, until she settled her bill for the surgery. That was disgusting. On two different occasions one of my pets needed to be seen urgently, both times I was told that I couldn't be ""accommodated "", as if I was I trying to get a better table at a restaurant rather than possibly dealing with a life or death situation. I ended taking my pets to Sunridge Animal Hospital, and having to make tough decisions with strangers. But my ability to trust Dr. Fisher was irrevocably damaged, when I took both my dogs in to see Dr. Fisher after I discovered a lump on the roof of my 10 year old male dogs mouth. I brought my 12 year old female dog with me to the appointment with Dr. Fisher, because I wanted to have her weighed. At her previous appointment, Dr. Fisher had put her on a diet, and I thought she had lost enough weight. Dr. Fisher told me he was seriously concerned about how much weight my dog had lost, and felt he needed to do a panel of X rays to rule out anything serious. At that point, I had no reason not to trust his judgement so I agreed. 500 later, I was told that what I thought had been my healthy dog, now needed a life saving EMERGENCY splenectomy. And that the lump on the roof of my male dog's mouth was going to require an ""aggressive "" surgically procedure to remove it. Dr. Fisher wanted to operate on both dogs that same day. I refused because both dogs had just eaten, so neither dog could be put under anesthesia. Dr. Fisher reluctantly agreed with me that he couldn't operate, but then became adamant that I schedule both surgeries for the following morning. When I told him I felt I should get a second opinion, Dr. FIsher became irate with me and implied I was a bad owner and stressed that by delaying the surgery I was risking my female dog dying a sudden and painful death. When I left I was in tears and completely distraught. n nWhen I got home, I called our dogs breeder who helped reassure me and advised against putting either of our senior dogs through such traumatic surgeries. Later that night, she gave me the number for Dr. Taylor of Mountain Vista Animal Hospital. The next day, I picked up my dog's X rays which Dr. Fisher didn't want to release and took both dogs to Dr. Taylor for a second opinion. Thank God I did. As it turned out, there was NOTHING wrong with my 12 year old dog, and I was told that NOTHING on the X ray would have EVER made Dr. Taylor suggest to me that something might be wrong. WOW! And Dr. Taylor recommended against operating on my 10 year old dog as well, because a dog's palate is too sensitive and Dr. Taylor felt any attempt to operate would be INHUMANE. Double WOW! Obviously, we never stepped foot inside Oasis Animal Hospital again. My male dog passed away at the age of 12, without ever having a painful palate surgery. My female dog passed away at 15 without EVER having a spleen issue. Very long lives for large breed dogs. n nIf you're reading this review, and you think you love trust Dr. Fisher, my warning to you is, if you ever take your pet in and have any doubts about a treatment plan. You owe it to your pet, to get a second opinion. It could end up being the difference between life and death.",1
"Well, the soup was Ok. For a restaurant that calls itself a 'steakhouse', I expect a descent steak, cooked at least close to how it was ordered. nI ordered a NY Strip rare, which arrived med.well.

I just had to update because I've now been seeing Dr. P for almost a year, and this in itself is a miracle before I would see a dentist, get my exam x rays cleaning, and peace out. I'm still terrified of going, but the staff is just amazing and I get through every appointment 100 fine. They are so flexible with billing as well, which really helps out when you're getting a lot of work done. Dr. P is great, the staff is all great, and I am super happy I found them!",2
"One star for the food and Once Star for the service. n nI have been to the hash house a few times, but never have I experienced bad service until just recently. n nI came here with my parents and sister. Upon arriving we were told we had a 25 minute wait, which was fine. However, once we were seated we had to wait 25 minutes to order drinks, and place our order we did both at the same time . Finally after waiting another 25 30 minutes we got our food. I'm sorry but spending an hour and half to get mediocre food is just lame. n nI got a portabello burger with home fried potatoes. I love the breakfast potatoes which is why I want to come. Since I had never been for lunch I thought I would try a lunch item. It sucked. I didn't' get any sauce or cheese because of dairy.but they did not even offer any alternates.

"To make a long story short n nI stayed here for 3 nights. First 2 nights were fine, last night was the worst night i've ever spent in a hotel. There was some kind of frat party in the room next to mine and there was mayhem all night long. No human could sleep with that much noise. I felt like I was getting the torture where they don't let you sleep even though you are dead tired. n nI called the front desk 3 times. The first time, security came. The noise stopped for 5 minutes or so. The security told me ""if they are still loud please call again and we will evict them. "" The 2nd and 3rd times that I called to complain nothing happened. n nWhen I left my room at 630am there were hundreds of cigarette butts on the ground on a non smoking floor , beer bottles everywhere and a couple of passed out clowns sleeping in front of my door that I had to step over to leave. Sidenote, the cigarette smoke was coming in my room all night and it was horrible. n nAfter breakfast I came back to my room to call the front desk again and let them know about the mess in the hall. I again expressed my frustration that nothing was done to silence the frat party. The woman was really nice on the phone and apologized and said that she would send up a complimentary breakfast and give me a credit. I waited for over an hour for my breakfast. It never came. I hope that I get my credit. n nDon't stay here if you value sleep and a responsive management. n nClowns.",1
"Found this place by just driving down the road at lunch. A few cars near by so I decided to stop in. n nIt was a Wednesday at lunch time. Greeted fairly fast by someone wearing a chef outfit.

It was derived very fast, too. My colleague enjoyed his lunch, too. n nYou can get fresh fish, lobster, crab, etc as they have them there! Prices are posted on the wall no no surprises. n nThe waitress was not that sensitive to the fact we were working gents on lunch break so she was about as laid back as the senior citizens that were dining in at the same time we were.

"My experiences here have been great! Most recently I came in to replace a tire and it was done very quickly and the service was polite and friendly. They also checked on a number of other things for me for free. They didn't try to upsell me on anything, and they gave me expected time frames for the life of some of my other parts. All in all, it was quick and fairly inexpensive, as have been my previous experiences here as well.",2
"Reasonable AYCE sushi. n nAs I was searching on Yelp for All you can eat sushi, this place popped up and since I never tried this spot out I said ""Why Not.

The staff was on point with drinks and ordering sides. The sushi chef was very friendly as well. I looked at the menu and noticed that AYCE was 21.95 for dinner and 19.95 for lunch. Now that is not bad at all! n nThe sushi was delicious and they had a lot of rolls to choose from. My favorite was the SSS roll.it was amazing! We also ordered some yellow tail, octopus, surf clam, and Cajun albacore. All delicious and not overloaded with rice. They also had 1 hot sake, I'm not a sake fan but that is not a bad price at all!",2
"This place is crowded with a long wait to get seated. This would be ok if the food was worthwhile. It isn't. The food is bland and generally poorly prepared. The number of choices isn't that great and worst of all everything I had was lukewarm at best. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because we had an attentive server. n nHere's a couple of examples. The crab legs are served cold unless you carry them yourself to the fish bar to have them steamed. Guaranteed to make them watery and tasteless! I think the drawn butter is the stuff you put on movie theater popcorn. There was some sausage that was cooked to a nice medium rare. Sorry, I didn't find out how that tasted. I like Israeli style couscous the big kind . It really should be cooked so it isn't like a Grape Nut though. n nThey do have some good bread and the 10 Stella Artois was tasty. n nGo here only if you want to pay 35 a head for basically Golden Corral level food. I'm honestly flabbergasted with the people who gave it good reviews.",1
"We will never go to this racist place again. My husband along with my son waited for over 10 minutes for someone to serve us, no one ever stopped by to even greet us. They weren't even busy, I watched a few tables get sat after us and the servers didn't waste any time going to greet them and taking their drink order. One server walked by us twice and looked at us without saying a word and she wasn't busy bc she was standing around talking to other servers who were waiting for tables. I'm sure if we weren't black they would have greeted us with a smile, but we decided to get up and leave and spend our money elsewhere. I just moved to Charlotte and clearly I don't know the rules about the white and black sides of town and clearly this is for the white people!",1

Fun atmosphere with a big backyard and a run down country bar feel, diverse crowd, more laid back people. Waited forever for the next dance act but it took too long and we were tired. The drinks only seemed to kick in after I got home, when I needed them least. Still, something different than the usual sleek primpy crowd, fun!",2
"this place is a dump. and worse, it cost 180 night to stay here! nthey put us all the way in the back. in a whole different building. and made us walk through what we called chicken shit alley. nour room had 2 beds that felt like the sheets were made of sand paper. our toilet was one like in a public restroom where it didn't have a back part. our shower didn't drain so none of us could use it. nwe asked for a cot when we check in, and clearly it never came. nhonestly terrible.",1
"I wish I had looked this place up on yelp before I played here. First I checked to see if they would have any cart restrictions for the weekend I was playing. There schedule said NO RESTRICTIONS! The weekend we went to play Sept. 27, 2013 the whole golf course was CART PATH ONLY. It was the joke of the day, we didn't know what they were trying to protect. The place is a DUMP. Burnt greens, weeds on every one. Couldn't putt on a single one. NEVER AGAIN!",1
This place keeps going on the decline. Their all you can eat menu is down to a zerox copy with a very limited selection. All they do is make all the other sushi places around Vegas looked so much better.,1
"Went there last night with a co worker for the first time. We both are veggie's so both got different kinds of veggie dogs. nAs far as veggie dogs are considered, I really need them to be cooked split open on a grill for them to taste good. These were just heated up in some boiling water. So already, that just really turned me off to them before I even took a bite. The dogs were alright semi loaded with toppings, but they weren't anything special. I definitley needed two hotdogs to fill me up. For the price, I expected more. n nCustomer service there was pretty lacking. While one of the guys was pretty nice, the other guy. needed some customer service training. After browsing the menu for about 5 minutes, we started to place our orders. Hot dog server 2 gruffly said, ""Next time you guys are going to order veggie dogs, make sure you let us know in as soon as you walk in because they take awile. "" We responded we weren't in a rush, so no need to worry about the time! He responds, ""Yeah, but we like to get 'em out fast so next time let us know. "" This guy also spent a lot of time looking down at his phone, which was especially rude when he was in the middle of a coversation with another patron at the place. n nI did love the lime green interior. It's quite a small place, so don't expect to take a big group there and have room to sit inside. There are a few small tables for people to sit at. n nAll in all, I have been to much better hot dog shops.",1
"I can not say enough good things about this service. I have used them twice now and the delivery driver is always so friendly. The first time I got a second day delivery for free, they insist on not accepting tips, though I certainly would give them one. I've gotten a blend of produce, meat and household products. They have a decent selection of organic produce as well. This time around I used the same day service and the delivery was prompt and friendly as always! I had ordered some beer and since I was at work, the driver was thoughtful enough to put it in a discreet bag so that no one could tell. No one at my work would care but how very nice! I absolutely love these guys and hope the best of success for them. They have been a lifesaver during a hectic holiday season.",2
"I went to French Market Buffet at the Orleans on a Saturday for brunch. It was 15 person and totally NOT worth it. I should have gone to TGIF, which is also located in the Orleans. n nThe food was sub par. The only two items that were tasty were the ribs and the gelato for this , both of which you had to ask a server for. There are different food stations, but their themed dishes were not worthy. Customer service was great, but there was still nothing memorable about this location. n nPlease save your and try another buffet.",1
"Considering our previous experience this lunch was as unexpected as it was disappointing. n nAs mentioned before the lunch menu only offered 5 dishes to chose from , and no choice of protein. Since we didn't want beef stir fry the choices were chicken or chicken. n nThe soup was clear broth of chicken with rice. Not bad tasting mind you but tame enough for a senior assisted living facility. I'm not a fan of spring rolls but I thought the one I was served tasted simply bad. n nWe ordered medium hot Kan Dang chicken red curry, bamboo shoots, peas. nIt wasn't even remotely hot and besides there was little there, there. A few shreds of chicken and little else. Not bad, but not very good either n2 stars n nA dish of large flat rice noodles, chicken mushrooms, peppers,onions, cabbage whose name escapes me. Again no heat at all. The ingredients made for an ok dish but it was dull tasting, made me think more of reheated Chinese take out than of Thai. n nIt's hard to believe this is the same restaurant we ate at last month. As if the chef had told the help ""you'll find the lunches in the freezer, everything is labeled "" and left on vacation.",1
"I somehow only made it to Coronado Cafe once before they closed, and it was a great experience. So I was naturally excited to see the transformation into Urban Vine. Unfortunately, I wish it hadn't changed. I see and admire what the place is going for, but it seems they've tried too hard. Simple lunch foods were fancied up too much. The burger was just okay, and the chicken sandwich didn't taste like any other chicken sandwich I've had before. Boo. Both came with chips that were so heavy on the salt and vinegar that we couldn't eat them. A fresh selection of things to add to your water was fun. Lastly, the table was as crowded as the menu, and simply wasn't comfortable. Here's the thing a simple old house with a simple old menu would have the chance to be very successful here. If that happens, I'll be excited to return.",1
"Opted not to go with the house special beef noodles as my friends did, figuring I'd be getting my greasy fill soon enough at some buffet. I got the ""Sai Men noodle Aloha Style Broth "" n nSaimin I don't think any local Hawaiian would mistake this for something you'd order on the islands. No charsiu they used boiled chicken. Huge piece of fried sweet potato tempura on top not sure where that came from. And mushrooms. That being said, it was pretty good. Light flavors as I was hoping and a nice delicate broth. Noodles are definitely Chinese straight and a bit thicker than normal saimin in Hawaii. n nFriend's Homestyle Spicy Braised Beef Shank Ramen looked really good too. n nMongolian beef and Garlic Tofu Eggplant dishes were also good. Not super spicy but they do requests for that. n nSitting at the counter is also fun as you get to watch the old school cooks do their thing. n nService was great. The guy in charge of the counter customers was very attentive and our food came out quickly. n nAnother good sign was that 95 of the customers were Chinese.",2
"I'm a sucker, I've eaten here twice the food isn't actually THAT bad my chicken quesadilla was crisp, and the salsa fresh, but the service and the chaos in this place is pretty bad. I actually sat at a dirty table for fifteen minutes waiting to be acknowledged while waitresses buzzed around me. When I flagged one like, desparate to have my table cleaned and order, she said, ""this isn't my table. "" okaaaaaay. the C gate area sucks for food choices, you either have fat city specials like Pizza Gut, or this place. mmm, what about a Nathan's hot dog? that idea is free.",1
"Fun, exciting, adrenaline pumping is how I would describe The HUNT! I can't imagine a better way to experience Vegas and all of the incredible attractions it has to offer. The HUNT staff had so much energy! They made sure we didn't miss a beat. I Highly Recommend The HUNT for group events in Vegas, there were 12 of us and we had an absolute blast!",2
"Ever since Ciao Ciao on Durango closed I've been in search of a comparable clam pizza. After reading some reviews from my fellow Yelpers I decided to give this place a try. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the clam pizza. I recommend the white sauce. Also tried the standard cheese slices and they were great as well. They also have a large selection of Italian deli products to go and a full menu of sandwiches.",2
"Used to love this place. But the coffee has declined, is near awful now. .I don't understand the recent reviews saying the coffee is good it really isn't. Also, it used to be seedy in a delightful way, but is now just a drab sports bar type place. The only remaining charm comes from its function as a neighborhood social hub. n nTip n n they are relaxed enough that you can bring bagels in, and eat with your coffee. You'll make a mess, but just clean up afterwards. n n if you want to watch the game with a coffee, this might be your place.",1
"Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla! I paid 7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from 1.50 to 5.50 but are you kidding me 7.65. Then to top it off.I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect! So, after I was done throwing a temper tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know okay just kidding about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!",1
"Disappointing. I had out of town guests visiting, and we wanted some ice cream after our dinner. We were in the general area, and I had heard so many good things about Mary Coyles, that I suggested we try it out. My friends were impressed with the appearance of the place when we got there. It was about 815pm on Sunday night. The place was reasonably busy. After looking at the menues, We decided on a ""Peak "" which was listed as three flavors of ice cream with three different sauces for each scoop, and a simple sundae of Peppermint Bark Icecream with hot fudge. n nAfter waiting quite a while, our ice cream arrived. First shock the Peak came in a tumbler, not in a boat or bowl. so it was three scoops of icecream all different flavors on top of one another, with the sauces all mixed in. To make matters worse, it was melted, so more like a milkshake instead of sundae. My peppermint bark sundae was also melted and mushy. The three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes. When the waitress came around to check on us, we let her know that we were disapointed in both the presentation of the Peak, and the fact that both items were melty and runny. She offered to have them remade, but by this time, we just wanted to leave. She presented the bill with a 10 discount. Woopty doo.No visit from a manager, no offer to take care of us next time. just a ""here is your 1.25 off "". So we ended up paying something like 12 for two runny, melted dishes glasses really of ice cream.",1
"I gave TGI Friday's a good review back when it was a great value. Well, things have changed. n nMy mother is a seasoned citizen. She collects her coupons from Smith's grocery store, and loves to use them. One of the coupons is a two fer one at TGI Fridays. Her youngest son was going out of state for about six months, and she wanted us to send him off, with full belly off a comped meal. Oh my, she was in for a surprise. n nIn the past, if four adults had two coupons, two could eat free. The coupons were laid out on the table, and the waiter very polite.we can't kill the messenger advised only one coupon per table. When confronted with value versus togetherness, value won, and we sat at different tables. Seems a little silly, huh? It didn't stop there. This TGI Fridays advertises steak and lobster for 13.99 if you are there before 6 00 p.m. When me and the hungry wife both ordered that meal, the waiter swooped in with more bad news, since we were using the coupon, we would be charged the regular price for the steak and lobster! So, now it's 18.99 for two steak and lobster dinners. Well, we'd get some of that back, because we had the kid with us, and kids eat free on Tuesday night. Well, not exactly. The waiter offered the final apology, stating that the customer must chose one promotion. If the kid eats free, then the steak and lobster dinners will be charged. n nThis was quite upsetting to my mother. She loved to land upon this restaurant and abuse the freebies. n nOkay, on to the food. The steak was tiny, but it was cooked right. It had garlic butter on the top. A nice, tasty addition. The lobster tail was also tiny, but tasty. They didn't gyp on on the baked potato, it was big. There was some steamed broccoli, most of which was neglected. Maybe they should promo ""all you can eat steamed broccoli ""? The broccoli was fine. The wife had a margarita. It was still happy hour, and the waiter had no bad new for us on the discount for that, 5, and a good value. n nI'd say that we got what we paid for. This meal at full price is not worth the money. For those of you who frown upon coupons.you better bring them, and try to use them, if you are going to try to get value at this place.",1
"They do NOT take Groupons. I repeat, they Do NOT take Groupons. And they make it perfectly clear when you walk in the door. This already threw me off. n nThis place is around the corner from my house and we saw a Groupon for it so we wanted to try it out. The waitress also wanted to make it clear that they do not take Groupons. We ended up staying for their happy hour. We got a 10 inch pizza with mushrooms, green peppers, sausage and bacon. I've never had a Chicago style deep dish pizza before. I'm sorry, but never again. They went way overboard with the sauce. We also ordered some mild wings that they said were the best wings ever. I thought they were a bit spicy for mild. n nThe only upside was the beer was very reasonably priced for happy hour. Good service, but I won't be back. You guys are called Rosatis yet u don't accept Rosatis Groupons.",1
Rinaldi's never lets me down! n nI love their turkey sandwiches with honey mustard.it's delish. That's all I've ever had and all I'll ever get! ,2
"If you want to feel like you are staying at Reno instead of Las Vegas, get this hotel. The hotel rooms are dirt cheap here for the location. It is right on the strip. It is right next to the Venetian. n nThe casino portion is scary. All the drunk trash and touristy types frequent the casino floor here. The gambling area is small, like the whole hotel itself. n nThe rooms have a very low ceiling, and are connected by stairs for arthritic elderly and a slow moving elevator. You get a really decent sized room fridge. I mean, c'mon, if you're staying here, you are for sure going to be pre drinking, cheap ass. n nThe room feels isolated from the strip, with little to no view. And if you get lucky, you get a view of the pool. Which no one goes too. n nThey do have 1 Michelobs and small Margaritas. n nThere is an Outback Steakhouse indoors. There's a Denny's. There is also a 24 hour Subway and Ben Jerry's and a pizza joint. n nThe t shirts and jackets are cheap. Price and looks. n nThough I can not really say anything positive about the place, for the price, and the location, you can't argue. n nLet your ""high roller "" friends stay at the Venetian or the Wynn and waste their wages. You can save money here.",2
"SEA BASS MISO Robata styled! n nCelebrated the 20th anniversary of a friend and his wife and we ordered the tasting menu, since it was our first time in a restaurant like this, and we walked out singing the praises of the SEA BASS MISO Robata styled. n nThe SEA BASS MISO was presented on a skewer and cooked perfectly. The Miso was perfect, like nothing I have tasted and the freshness of the Sea Bass was evident. I almost passed out knowing I have not tasted seafood this good before. n nThe tasting menu was very expensive, but we were celebrating and we were given the guarentee we could send back any dish that we did not like and we did.only once though . The cost of the tasting menu was about 60 a person. n nWe were given a good sample of their seviches, sushi wraps, tempura, and desserts. The quality of the food was top notch. The service was outstanding. The food presentation was great. n nWhen I come back, I will be getting a good helping of the SEA BASS MISO Robata styled and tempura.",2
"why hello there, hole in the wall that's not really a hole in the wall, except for the food.delicious! i love the tacos durados fried tacos chicken and their rice is just like mama makes it. the photos below do not do the food justice. don't go during lunch unitl after 1pm or you'll have slow service, everything is cooked up fresh.the salsas are hot hot hot. love it!",2
"It was a busy day for them on account of the lunch hours, and they had the longest line in the food court area. They ask you what you like as you get up to the front, and I wanted a burrito however when I looked at the rice it had Cilantro on top of it, and I dislike the taste of that, so I was going to skip on that but before I can tell him that he placed it on the burrito without asking then asked what I wanted next. n nI am not one to make a scene and the workers looked pissed off as hell from dealing with tourist all day so I didn't complain and just picked some other toppings. n nI found a seat thank goodness to sit down. I tried the rice and of course hated it so I ate only partly one side of my burrito. What a waste n nWell I won't go here next time",1
"After always going to Bahia San Carlos for 20 years, we thought we should try a new place and, coincidentally, saw Check Please featuring Mariscos Playa Hermosa. My late parents were born in Mexico and I live next to the border for half my 65 years. I also traveled on business to Baja often so I feel my comments have some basis in experience with Mexican food and Mexican seafood in particular. I have to say I was disappointed. With the exception of the ceviche best in town and the guacamole the meal was poorly prepared. I had the camaron al mojo de ajo and my wife had the similar camaron y pulpo mojo de ajo. The small place was jammed though that is no excuse for the shrimp being overcooked to the point of being able to pass for shrimp jerky. The pulpo was fine. My mother always added peas to the rice but here there were also lima beans. Huh? The so called flan was more like a wet, sweet cornbread in consistency rather than custard like. When I told the server it was ""weird "", she said it was probably overcooked. Then why serve it? Wanted to like the place but it is back to Bahia for me.",1
"We had lunch here and the food was wonderful. I had the Reuben Sandwich, it was hands down the best corned beef I have ever had. nThe food service was very good also.",2
Wow! Seriously good Biria Soup. It came with a good helping of tortillas. I want to go back and try something else.,2
"Place is kind of a joke took an hour and a half to get some cold chili salsa and cold pizza. pretty much only thing to it is the whole harry potter deal, which didn't seem worth it. would've been a nice casual coffee place if cheaper and not packed with tourists which admittedly i was ",1
Restaurant is beautiful. Food can be pricey but is very good. Service was okay. I Recommend a reservation.,2
"The food here is excellent, I think the collard greens were the most outstanding item.really, really good! We both had the fried chicken and it was fresh and super crispy. n nNice environment and the servers are very lovely.",2
"I see all of the 4 and 5 star reviews and I think, I wanted it to be like this! Unfortunately, I cannot say that it was. The service started off bad and got worse. the water was. dreadful. their ice was so bad that it ruined the taste of Soda, the alcoholic drinks and Im sure anything else it came in contact with. it was so bad that when I had my friends that were with me over for drinks a few weeks later, I advised them that my ice was not from the Peppermill The quality of the food was poor and tasted funny. Our waitress was very cold and short and didnt do anything out of the norm to impress me. i am not saying that she should have, but a smile would have helped. I will not be going back to this place. for everyone else, good luck. It seems like some people have had great luck here.",1
"I was really disappointed with the service here. I went for a quick lunch on the Tuesday before Christmas and ordered a draft beer and a burger. It took forever for the beer to come, even after I managed to intercept the server to ask about it. When it finally showed up it was flat, and I went through the process again to get a bottle instead, thinking they couldn't screw that up. Meanwhile, I could see the bartender practicing his bottle flipping moves and he wasn't very good at that either. The place was nearly empty but the server was usually nowhere to be seen. When the burger finally came, it was fine I guess, but I was too pissed off to enjoy it. I had to flag down caught the manager to get my check. Then I had to get her again to charge the meal to my room they needed to use a different check for that, and no one asked me how I wanted to pay. The place was not very well run and seemed indifferent to the customers. I won't go back.",1
"Great prices and I LOVE the gas discounts! nI also love that little Gold envelope that comes every few months with free Smith's nWhen you add up the price savings in store, the gas discounts, and the quarterly rebate they are waaay cheaper than the other stores. nThe best thing is the cheapness does NOT affect the quality of goods, the cleanliness of the store, or the attitudes of the staff. nThey're always fully stocked, clean, and the staff is always super friendly and helpful. nOnly complaint why I took off a star .their bakery seems to be changing some of their recipes. nThey used to have the BEST cookies, my personal favorite being the pumpkin chocolate chip. They're not even close to what they were a year or 2 ago. Same with their fudge cake. ",2
Hands down the best Greek food in the Valley. Service is impeccible. Very clean establishment. Anytime I'm in the area I have to stop by. I've even got my friends hooked on it. Highly Recommend.,2
"So, I'm a bike rider and commute to and back from work everyday except not it the recent awful weather damn this winter! . I have been going to these guys for repairs for years after having some bad experiences with a couple of other places in the East End I may write some not so good reviews for them soon . Important to note I am a biker, but I am not apart of the biker subculture. I don't know everything there is to know about bikes and bike repairs, and I absolutely HATE the pretentiousness of some of the people who work at other bike stores. It makes me not want to take my bike in when it needs repaired because I feel like an idiot. However, I tried these guys 3 or 4 years ago, and they have been amazing to me. There are no hangups about lack bike or part aptitude, and I don't feel guilty about walking in and saying, ""It won't work "" The guys here have always been super helpful, articulate and careful not to offend my obviously sensitive self. The repairs have always been relatively cheap and I have never felt ripped off. Furthermore, I just purchased a used road bike after moving back into the country, and I took it straight to them. They altered the brake lines a bit, pumped up the tires, gave me an oral diagnostic, and didn't charge me a dime. I told them that in the future I would never take the bike anywhere else for repairs, and that I would tell all of my friends to give them their business. With this review I'm keeping up my end of the bargain. Thanks Iron City!",2
"How I love Printworks. I wish I could take this cafe with me everywhere I go. n nThe setting is pleasant and bright, the coffee is great and there's a nice eclectic selection of sandwiches. Soup is hearty, various and wonderful. The staff are always pleasant to deal with and fairly efficient. When I first discovered Printworks I was a little stressed out by the shared nature of some of the seating, but the regulars seem considerate and generally able to make it work. Depending on my mood, I usually opt for the humous or vegetarian wrap or the spicy meatball melt. There's a focus on local suppliers too, which is always good. n nPrintworks don't do anything too wild or crazily out of the ordinary. But there's still a nice variety on the menu and the quality is consistent.",2
"So I hate to say that I have had the fun task of storing crap. Moving in with the boy meant sacrificing majority of my belongings to a storage unit. I was absolutely dreading moving. n nAfter shopping online for an affordable, air conditioned storage unit that was close to home, I came across Extra Space Storage. Their website is easy to navigate, and their prices are affordable. This location is inside with air conditioning, but I know they differ throughout their several Valley locations. n nNever had a problem with service, access, or safety. I would recommend this Extra Space Storage unit to anyone.",2
"Not a very big or kept up park. Lots of dog poop left around the park and only street parking, no parking lot. Grass needs to be cut as well. The 2 times ive been here the grass has been long and lots of poop scattered about. Park definetly has potential if kept up.",1
"It's hard to judge a restaurant based on a single visit with a large group, but service was so awful at this Chompie's that there is no way I would ever make the drive to meet anyone at this location again. n nA friend of mine was in town but only had limited time to meet up, so a group of about 15 people plus three small children decided to meet for lunch. We did the smart thing and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1 30. We were seated in a ""party room "" which had a TV, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty. Three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them. The floor hadn't been swept. And, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there. n nSo now for the real problem. We were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in. We all ordered food and drinks. It became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed. It must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks. I don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pitchers of water and glasses during that time? Drinks finally arrived. Then nothing. It was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table. I'm not joking. An hour later and our meals still weren't ready. It was 2 30 in the afternoon. I was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time. Fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time. Everyone was hungry. Neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen. When our orders finally arrived at 3 00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain . The saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong. The waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3 30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out. n nThe one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other Chompie's. Which is excellent. The ambiance is modern instead of old fashion deli. But the service was a complete fail. They knew a big group was coming, if they were unable to accommodate us, they should have warned us.",1
"Bacchanal is a really good buffet in vegas. It has a good selection of food. The only thing that it was lacking was a good selection of sushi. Their shrimps for shrimp cocktail were big and very good looking. Crab legs were very meaty. They also have some reallllyyy good lamb chops. And if you're into green tea mochi, you're in luck. They also have some other flavors as well. n n1 star off for the price. I went for dinner on a weekday and it was 45 after taxes. This is not including tip. The only reason why this isn't my favorite buffet on the strip is because of the price.",2
"Since moving to Champaign from Chicago, I've really come to miss what I would call the ""greasy brown paper bag "" restaurants. A paper bag filled with a mess of fries and sandwich that are so greasy they leak right through, leaving a dark stain on the bag. n nWhen I came into JJ Fish the first time, I felt like I was back at home in Chicago. The people inside waiting for their food were talkative and friendly, the guy behind the counter was a bit of a jokester with a sly smirk and a warmth to his demeanor. The air was thick with fried chicken, fish, and grease. n nFor 2.99, I got a freshly cooked fish sandwich served up hot with cheese, tartar sauce, and a whole mess of fries. The food was very tasty, but wasn't anything terribly special outside the context. Given the price, though, and the fact that I got to have a humorous conversation with the cashier, it made it worth coming back a week later to do the same. Later, I'd like to give the chicken a shot, since it seems to be what most everyone else in there orders. They must know something I haven't yet discovered. n nA slice of local Chicago culture a hundred miles outside the city limits.",2
"Absolutely fabulous bar in the Paris hotel! Great location, right in the center of everything, great for people watching, and the best part is that they have 2 for 1 Martini's from 12 7pm on a daily basis 5 stars for me!",2

"Whoever runs this place should be fired! I was in town to play a Video Poker Tournament at Bally's. I was up playing poker until 6 00am and was up around 10 00am so I was pretty tired and too lazy to walk drive anywhere to eat. I always see a long line whenever I walk by the buffet. I just thought the food must be OK. Boy was I wrong! n nWe didn't have to wait at all since we were able to go through Diamond entrance. The cashier and host were very nice, so no complains here. Long long time ago when Paris first opened, we did dine here once. I could not recall my experience but I am sure it wasn't bad enough for me to remember it. n nThe host led us to our table and took our drink orders. She said to go ahead to the buffet and our server would get our drinks. Well, when we returned to our table after getting our food, the drinks were not there. When the waitress finally showed up, she had to ask what we wanted to drink again! After she got our drinks, we hardly saw her again. She was more interested in cleaning up tables than serving tables. Maybe she should have taken a job as a bus girl instead of a server. I had to flag her down a couple of times to get crab cracker not sure if this is what it is called and wet towelette. She never came by to check if we needed refill or anything. n nAnd the food was the worst buffet I have ever seen. The selections were very minimal. The only thing good was the omelet from the omelet station, but who can mess up on omelet! The crab legs were OK. The crepe was bleh. I also got a thin cut of what I thought was roast beef, but I am pretty sure I got lamb. I don't eat lamb and I know the smell of lamb. I couldn't tell until I sat down on the table and smelled the 'funny smell'. I couldn't even take a bite. I am really upset the lady mistaken the lamb for beef! n nI walked around trying to find something else to eat but nothing really looked appetizing. I settled for a small bowl of salad. I figured I could just get some dessert to make me happy. When I walk around the dessert 'house', the place looked deserted! There was nobody attending the dessert house! There was no cookies, no cakes, just a few pieces of pies, and a soft serve station. I was a few fruit tarts inside but I couldn't get to them! What the hell happened? This is Paris! It's supposed to have good pastries, right? n nBoth my fiance and I left in great disappointment. And I am really upset I wasted 50 from my comp credit for this sh! ty buffet! My fiance filled out the survey card, but I am sure it'd just be thrown to the trash can. n nOn my way out, I really wanted to tell all the people that were still waiting in line to 'run'. There are plenty of other places to eat buffet. Don't be lazy like me, because you'd pay for it like me and hate yourself afterwards!",1
"Worst service in Vegas. Avoid it, food took way to long, when it did came out it was exceptionally lame. n njust go somewhere else.",1
Are you kidding me? n nCRUNCHY pancakes. Horridly slow service. Terrible coffee. Reconstituted powered eggs. Extremely over priced. Will never come back here. Do yourself a favor and just get a muffin from the Starbucks on property for breakfast. n nI'd give this place zero stars if I could! It was probably the lowest point of the whole weekend.,1
"The best part about this restaurant is the ambiance and the view of the Bellagio Fountains. Luckily we were able to get a seat by the window with an amazing view and I was mesmerized by the fountains. Being my first time in Las Vegas I am glad I went, but next time I am in Vegas I doubt I will go to ETR. Not saying I won't go back ever, just wasn't as blown away by the food as I was expecting. I have mixed feelings about the staff. They were polite and attentive, but there were times I felt they were a bit snobby and not accommodating. The host at the front of the house annoyed me at the beginning we were about 5 minutes late for our reservation, our fault I realize, but they made us wait about 30 minutes. The host was not extremely helpful trying to make me feel better about this and made it worse by how much he referred to us being late. I mean yes we were late, but 5 minutes? Anyway, once we finally got our table with such an awesome view I was very happy and in a great mood. We had several questions about the wine selection which seemed to annoy our server. Otherwise, the service was fine just not the best I've had at fine dining establishments. For the price I was expecting stellar service and food. My boyfriend and I have been to some great fine dining French restaurants The French Room in Dallas being our favorite . For two people, we ended up spending just over 200. n nWith all that said, the food was very good and overall our night was very enjoyable. If I return to Las Vegas with someone who hasn't been to Vegas before, I would go back to ETR for the ambiance. If bf and I return within the next couple of years, we will go elsewhere.",2
"Fairly good gelato. Expensive, but what isn't in Vegas. It makes for a nice snack to eat while you take a break from walking and hang out in ""Piazza San Marco "" and watch all the gondolas and tourists and everything. Great place to people watch, just like the REAL Piazza San Marco.",2
"I hate writing negative commentary on local businesses, but I was really disappointed in how Terrace Cafe treated us at breakfast. n nWe are big groupon users, and I have NEVER had an institution think twice about fully honoring a purchased groupon just past its expiration date before now. There is a first for everything I suppose . this is just incredibly short sighted. The whole point of a groupon is to get someone to try something new, in hopes that they will become something of a recurring customer. I regularly hold breakfast and lunch meetings in the South Charlotte restaurant scene, and thought Terrace Cafe might be a good place for such meetings. But they have lost my business with this foolishness. Incredibly frustrating. n nThe food itself was fine, though I think the hype has more to do with the nice ambience than particularly wonderful food. I had the acclaimed red velvet waffle and found it . okay. Just okay. It was dense which makes sense for red velvet and dry. It certainly wasn't bad, but it just didn't come across as anything special among waffles. Different? Yes. Delicious? I wouldn t go nearly that far. My wife thought her eggs, biscuit and grits were done nicely. And we both enjoyed our fru fru coffees. The presentation was attractive and the service was better than the somewhat mixed comments you read about this place, probably because we went on a Tuesday. So overall it was good, but not the amazing we were hoping for. These are honest opinions on the food and experience, formed BEFORE the groupon nonsense occurred at the end of the meal. n nHonestly though . if you're rating this place specifically on food is it meaningfully better than the nearby Original Pancake House? Not based on what we tasted today. Now the setting is in a difference league entirely . but the food itself wasn't a special draw. Given the OPH's standing as an excellent place for customer service and a good place to do business breakfasts, Terrace Cafe might be well served to think a little more broad mindedly about how they treat their would be customers.",1
"I was introduced to Elmer's by a friend of mine. I swear, I am addicted to the Buttered Torillas with Sauce but I love the Special Burro as well! Great food at Great prices. GO GO GO! Gotta little hole in the wall place that have a great product!",2
I will never rent from this place again and I'm encouraging all of my family and friends to never step foot in the building! They take weeks for simple repairs. then they tell me they're coming and never came. i missed 2 full days of work for a simple repair because their handy man is so unreliable. they charge fees that were not mentioned during the signing of the lease and make you pay before you can cut your ties from these people. i would advise anyone to stay away from this place! there are plenty of other companies!,1
"Just had a terrible experience at Roy's Las Vegas on Flamingo. Entered the parking lot at my reservation time to find no open parking spaces. I pulled up to the door and asked valet where I was to park as all the lot was full except those coned off for valet. They told me unless I let them park my car I was pretty much out of luck. I pulled up to the door, went inside and asked the Managing Partner Rodney Johnson about parking. The ensuing ten minute conversation revealed that Roy's management is subservient to the contract parking valet and restaurant management cannot override the valet decision. I asked him if it made good business sense to turn away a regular customer a customer that hosted his son's 3500. wedding party at Roy's over parking. He said they were saving the twenty open spaces for those that may come later and want valet. So it is Roy's business model to save spaces for those diners you hope will come later and might want valet while turning away someone that is already here and ready to be seated. He reminded me that valet is complimentary. I told him I would not let a kid that looked like he should be home studying his Jr. High math homework drive my Corvette. nI ultimately left telling him that it just doesn't seem good business to turn away a 150 check so the valet boys MIGHT later get a 5.00 tip. Not hard to understand why the other Las Vegas location recently boarded its doors and took down the torches.",1
"My first visit was very quick, doctor got the sample of my skin and I had an appointment for the next week to remove the stitches and learn about my diagnosis, at least, that was what doctor told me. n nWhen I came back following week, I asked desk assistant, if I need to pay for my visit. She replied that I needn't because it is a continuation of my previous visit. I didn't get a call with my diagnosis before this visit, so asked the nurse about my diagnosis and what doctor thought about my condition. Doctor came in and told me that I have a rare incurable disease. His tone rather calm and unsympathetic, as if all I got was a flu. I was shocked by my diagnosis and doctor's unprofessional attitude, I expected a little more compassion. n nIn one month after last visit, I received a bill. After several calls and their promises to call me back next day which they never did, I called the billing. Very rude lady explained to me that the reason why they changed their mind and decided to bill me is because I had a ""discussion with the doctor "". I couldn't believe that being curious about my diagnosis after one week wait can cost that much, given they didn't call me with my diagnosis. I didn't receive any apologies for their inconsistency, just a threat ""Next time, if you discuss something with a doctor, you'll be charged for that. "" n nNo, no next time for Omni. That's a shame that Dr. Racette turned out to be such a heartless scam artist.",1
I would absolutely recommend this this place to anyone who is looking for fast and affordable healthcare. n nI had a kidney infection that I let go on too long because of my lack of insurance. I was in pretty rough shape one day and decided to go to the Walgreens walk in clinic. The guy at the front desk referred me here because it would be quicker and cost half as much. I am so thankful he did!. The office is clean and the staff is super friendly. Cindy Steel was incredibly welcoming and compassionate.,2
"My Honey and I went here today for a lunch date for the first time ever. The ambiance was cozy, the staff was friendly, attentive, down to earth and MOST IMPORTANTLY THE FOOD WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!

"This review refers to the Cabana Suites section of the el Cortez Hotel. my husband and I stayed here last year and we didn't expect much since it was really cheap at only 33 night. However, our rooms were rather tiny but really nice and clean. I loved their art deco style. Everything was really modern especially their bathrooms. What I liked most about staying here was their service. Their employees are really nice and helpful. If you are planning on staying in Vegas' Fremont experience this is the place to go!",2
"Lonnie is great! He knows a lot about mattresses and was very helpful. We were not in the market to buy a mattress the day we went in, he was not pushy about selling us something that day and said it was a good idea to think about it and make sure we were going to be happy as it is something we would probably have for a while. Normally I am not into being shown around by a sales person but Lonnie was really helpful and because he was really listening to what we had to say had great advice. My partner and I found a bed we really liked at a good price. n nWe went to the competition across the street and that was just awkward. That sales guy wanted to know what price he would need to get to for us to leave the store with a mattress. High pressure sales, yuck. n nWe went back to Sleep America where we bought our bed from Lonnie, it was delivered the next day and we love it.",2
"Bad store. Absolutely awful drive through. I live not too far from this location and have come to it for food over the years. Each time, over quite some time, I've been horribly disappointed by the drive up service today was no exception. The food is McD's, what more need be said except that this time the burger tasted old and the fries were stale. Its one thing to wait 15 minutes when there are only two cars ahead of you and another to get crappy food once you finally get to the window. n nI've been here enough times to say with confidence Avoid this place.",1
The Club up at Top is the Bomb! I had so much fun!,2
"This bakery is hidden in the corner of a strip mall. When I went in, there was a guy behind the counter. I was expecting the usual ""hi "" but he never opened his mouth.he just stared at me. Then, 4,5 guys came out from the back just to stand there. It was REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. Then a lady came out. I don't know, I felt like I had to greet her since she stood right in front of me so I said ""hi. "" Can you guess what she did? She just stared at me. n nIt had only been around 2 or 3 min since I went in but honestly, I just couldn't wait to get out of there. So, I purchased 5 pastries and got out. The pastries were.ok.

"Don't Bother! This place is at a gas station and very unprofessional. You go into the little side store and order. Then you have to pay in the Gas Station's convenience store, and then go back to get your order. n nGot it to go since there was no room to sit anywhere. When I got home and open the boxes, everything looked good. As I ate the burger, mI realized that it was burned to a crisp.

" 30DaysOfYelp 19 30 n nSo our taxi driver didn't even know where this place was.but it was fun trying to explain! It's located behind the Trump tower looks a bit sketchy, so we didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. Once we walked in, Mercedes greeted us explained some of the exhibits artifacts we would be seeing. She was super friendly informative. I would suggest going to this museum with an open mind sense of humour because if you're a bit on the conservative side, I don't know if you'd enjoy it. We were all a bunch of perverts though, so win for us! Vegas, baby! n nThe EHM is a non profit a large portion of the collection was donated by The Exodus Trust a trust that performs educational, scientific, literary functions relating to sexual, emotional, mental physical health. n nThe front part is an sexual studies library for students, I believe, and gift shop, and there's even a wedding area, heh. Once you get in the exhibit part, you walk through a section fashioned to look like a red light district, and then you encounter a giant penis made entirely of pennies! Pennies, penis.get it? Hahahaha! I was amused, anyway. n nInside there are artifacts such as erotic Peruvian pottery, carvings from Asia depicting sexual acts, deflowering tools some from the 6th century! , and other kinds of penis sculptures. Then there are tons of dildos, porn actress cutouts, star wars porn, articles about sexual scandal involving political leaders, clergy, teachers, etc. n nGo to the washroom! Add your own washroom graffiti! You will find it by looking for the golden shower art. n nUpstairs there are a bunch of erotic paintings.some from the middle east banned ! They are so beautiful make sure to look carefully at the decorative details, such as in the smoke the folds of their robes.there are hidden surprises! There is one painting in particular though, painted by a very well known family friendly animator artist that was very surprising! You have to go there to check it out. n nThere are also classic porn videos playing.classic like 1915, haha! Who knew? Check out the mustache of the man when he's getting a blow job, lol! Not the blow job, the mustache. Also, you know the term ""Go f yourself ""? You will see a video how that is actually possible. Yep. n nAll in all, I enjoyed it a ton, but it could use more work. I think if they had the funding made the exhibits a bit more polished, people might take it more seriously, but that's my only gripe. n n.and if you go with your significant other, cheesy as some of it is, it's like mega foreplay for later. wink Yeahhh, VEGAS!",2
I came here for lunch the other day. The atmosphere is nice and the furniture gives it a great touch. It has a very Mediterranean feel to it. n nI got Turkish coffee to drink and they make it perfectly! n nWe got the hummus to start with pita bread and it was good. I got the beef kabob with two sides. The beef itself had great flavor and was very tender. I highly recommend it to anyone that can't decide what to get. You won't be disappointed. The Omar salad was meh as were the potatoes. I wish they had better sides. n nOverall a solid place to grab a bite. The lunch prices were pretty reasonable though I can't comment on prices for dinner. n nEXCELLENT SERVICE,2
"I absolutely love the cosmopolitan hotel so I had high expectations for this club. We called a day before and got on the VIP list. Girls were free, guys still had to pay 25. When we got up there I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere! It was so cool and big! We got drinks, expensive and not good. Tasted like cheap vodka. Then we all made our way to the dance floor. n nSecurity made it hard to hang out if you wanted to take a break. The only place you could stand around and talk with people was outside. They did have heat lamps which were a plus but it was still cold. Security was strict here. n nThe dance floor was not that big at all and it was really had to move around. There is a giant screen showing like naked girls dancing, not really interested. I'm not sure how much a table would have been but I definitely suggest it. n nI'm not sure if it was because it was thanksgiving weekend but there were a lot of awkward foreign tourists there. The only thing going for this place is the atmosphere.",1
"I was lucky enough to play in an exclusive charity tournament last month at the Links Course here. The course is old with many large trees that winds through the Biltmore neighborhood. Because of it's age, the trees are large and come into play on many holes. That's what makes it fun. n nThe front 9 of the Links course is very flat, while the back 9 runs through the rolling hills and offers great views of Camelback Mtn and other area landmarks. The 15th hole is a Par 3 that has a great view from the elevated tee. nhttp www.yelp.com biz photos arizona biltmore golf courses phoenix?select RmvjTxU1tFBH1y780Zgf6g RmvjTxU1tFBH1y780Zgf6g n nThe biggest downside to this place is the age of it's facilities. The clubhouse is old and very small. So is the pro shop. The parking lot is tiny too. Because of these limitations, the post tournament activities are staged outside.which isn't too great when you've been playing in the hot sun all day.I'd rather be inside a cool, air conditioned building than out in a sweltering hot tent. n nOverall, the event and day of golf was fun and for a good cause. I think if they invested some money on course updates and new facilities, it could be a 5 Star course. For now, it gets 4 Stars from me. n nReturn Factor 90 ",2

"Had a great day here. Lots to do hiking, kayaking, zip line, etc. Trails could be marked better as could directions to the different ""gear up "" spots. n nLow review is for their customer service. Apparently it is their policy not to issue refunds of any kind. I bought an event ticket I wasn't able to use for zip lining . They told me it wasn't their policy to issue any refunds. I can understand not issuing bracelet refunds if you're unsatisfied with an event. But I hadn't even done my event and had the ticket to show. We had to leave. They told me to come back any time, my ticket is good for a year. I explained I live in California and they had no other suggestions. Point is, a blanket no refund policy doesn't work and is poor customer service. There are certainly times when a refund is appropriate. If I hadn't paid cash, I'd would've refused the credit charge. n nBummer. I would recommend waiting to buy an event ticket when you're absolutely sure you'll be doing it.",1
"Ummm.where was the actual ride? We hopped on the gondola and were whisked away for a whopping 8 mins. The songs were great, but super short. The cost was unnecessary. We understood that it is Vegas, and things are very overpriced, but that was a little ridiculous. I would not recommend this to anyone, my recommendation go download some Italian songs, and walk down the side of the river as it will be a more pleasurable experience.",1
"I wanted to come here 'coz as I understand it, unlike other 'celebrity chefs', Rick Moonen actually works in this kitchen! Was he cooking the same stuff in NYC when he got his three stars?! n nDisappointed! That all I felt after the meal. We went for dinner last night and while service was good and friendly, food was, well. just not up to par. Yes we wanted a nice casual place to have good food and to hang out with a couple of friends but I didn't expect to get very mediocre food. What's the point of serving a huge amount of food and really, the servings are huge! if it's not excellent?! Both my husband and I were not impressed at all. n nI had the steamed mussels and the mussels were very fresh but the sauce was a little on the salty side and blah. I mean, just nothing to write home about. The gumbo is HUGE! If you plan on ordering it, SHARE! Gumbo is heavy to begin with and I thought it was just silly to serve that much. Even the hungry man at our table couldn't finish his without appetizers . Yes, it's full of good seafood and sausage. but still, nothing special. I wasn't expecting to eat the best gumbo of my life but I was expecting something better then what I got. My husband got the RM roll for appetizers rice was soggy YUK! and the roll uninteresting. and everything encrusted tuna. Now this serving was small. weird they can't seem to figure out their portions, I guess. n nI will say, the garlic bread is to die for! I would have been quite happy with an order of that and a bottle of Prosecco ",1
"Talk about a bait and switch. They wouldn't honor the table prices my friend negotiated. Ended up increasing prices on us by around 500. They kept us waiting and standing around. I'm bling, but in Vegas, I'm no high roller but these business practices leave a lot to be desired. n nHoliday weekend . and the line for table service practically wrapped around the casino . funny, the regular line didn't have anyone in it. n nClub itself was okay I liked the spaciousness of it and it was entertaining to people watch. Music was a bit all over the place but at least it was a good sound system.",1

"Ate here about a week ago with a large mixed group of people. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was crazy busy. The hostess was really nice and our wait ended up being about half an hour. We got seated at a very nice table and our waitress was very friendly and prompt. The atmosphere was great, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't have a conversation but loud enough to give you some privacy. We didn't want anyone hearing us talk about Star Wars Origami anyway. n nI had the chicken dumplings soup for an appetizer and the rest of my family enjoyed salad. My soup was a large portion and very delicious, my families salad was fresh and full of goodies. The breadsticks were plentiful, fresh and hot! Our waitress was very prompt with taking care of us even though she had a lot of tables. We enjoyed Parmesan Crusted Bistecca, Steak Toscano and Stuffed Chicken Marsala for the adult entree's. Everyone raved over their food but I found my plate Steak Toscano had some overly dry roasted potato's on it. Our kids all wanted spaghetti and they lapped it up. It looked fresh and they said it tasted great which means something because two of them are very picky eaters. n nWe had a great time here, the service and food were excellent but it won't get my fifth star because of my dry potatoes. The price wasn't too bad either for my husband, son and myself our bill including tip was about 55 which considering all the food we ate was an excellent deal.",2
"Just discovered this place today. In my opinion, it won't beat Cold Stone for the actual IceCream but the service was friendly, and personable, and the place has that old soda fountain feel, Even if it doesn't have the actual fountains. n nThe Maciknaw Fudge Ice Cream in the fresh waffle cone was exactly what I wanted.",2

"I was drawn to Nails because of the great designs and gel art I saw on yelp. However, I was very dissatisfied with the service I received. n nI got a gel manicure and a regular pedicure. I originally had a teal polish before I came into the salon, but the lady did not completely take off all of the polish. On the sides of my nails, you can see teal specks next to the coral polish that I chose. My manicure was not painted close to the cuticle, so it looked like I already had a week of nail growth. Also, my gel polish chipped only after two days. I definitely don't think the gel is worth it if it doesn't even last one full week. The application of the gel polish was uneven and very thick. My pedicure was decent, but it was nothing to rave about. Not much time was taken and it was okay. The only thing I liked was the variety of polish colors. n nI guess my search for a new nail salon in Vegas will have to continue!",1
"We went for the happy hour that everyone raved about and missed it by 6 minutes. The times were not listed on the website so we were guessing. FYI, it's daily 3 5pm and 8 10pm.

I was not very pleasant with him because I was afraid of being ripped off by them. I was extremely uptight. Anthony was so patient with me even though I was being rude. Long story short, after about 45 minutes, I got a great deal! I am now a proud owner of an SUV. My purchase also included a service warranty. I am very pleased. All the guys in the office were awesome! Thanks to The Car Company, I now have transportation. Customer service in a business is hard to find in today's economy. But not at The Car Company. Keep up the great work! n nGREAT JOB GUYS n nLatosha ",2
"I have never been to Outback before but we had relieved 50 worth of gift cards to Outback for xmas thought it might be fun to end my birthday weekend with a nice dinner. My boyfriend figured there would be a wait so when we were told it would be a 20 min wait for a table we were not surprised. We decided to head to the bar to wait for our table but within in 5 min the pager for our table was lighting up. The bartender was in the middle of filling our drink order but assured us they would not give our table away. But they did. However, the hostess profusely apologized assured us we would have a table in minutes, which we did, so we weren't all that upset. When we got our table,being my 1st time, we had to order the Blooming Onion. My boyfriend jokingly said ""If it's not perfect it's going back "". But when it came it WAS perfect! Very good. We ordered our dinner my boyfriend got the sirloin lobster grilled I decided to get, from the special menu, the crab stuffed mushrooms appetizer as an entree the classic wedge salad. When dinner came I had not received the salad. I let them know within minutes it came. Unfortunately, I forgot a wedge salad traditionally does come with bacon, which I don't care for so I sent it back. Although I had not specified that I had not wanted bacon when I ordered the waitress took it back happily courteously. With in minutes I had a replacement sans bacon. Our meal was excellent the sirloin lobster was grilled to perfection. The crab stuffed mushrooms wedge salad also very good. In the middle of our meal the manager came to our table to apologize and comped part of our meal, even though we never complained. This to me shows the ultimate in customer service . Things don't always go perfect, that's just life. But a company that not only pays attention to the customer experience but proactively accommodates when things don't go perfect gets five stars in my book. We are already making plans to go back!",2
"When I got in to town I was starving so we went to zooza. The line moved slowly. Everything I wanted would take at least 15 minutes or more so I was told. Fish ' n chips, burgers don't take that long. Did they actually have a kitchen? n nAnyway, I decided on a 9 hotdog came with a dry bun. No effort put into it like toasting it or buttering it up and grilling it. Yawn. No sriracha, cholula or real relish. Just a crappy packet of no name relish. Yeah, I can be high maintenance. For 9, I have the right to be high maintenance. n nBTW, we were at the Wynn over the weekend and ZZC was not open 24 hours.",1
"Now that I work in the Water street district It was time to try new places for lunch. I ordered the wor won ton soup and it was delicious. Almost as good Golden Buddha's wor won ton soup back In the Bay Area. oh how I miss the BAY Any how the soup was tasty, not too salty and loaded with meats and vegetables. I ordered to go and it was a 10 minute wait. not long at all. Customer service is friendly. I will definitely be coming bak here for my Wor won ton soup fix. I may try something else next time!",2
