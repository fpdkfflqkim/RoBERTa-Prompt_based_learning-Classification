"It is subway, yes. But this particular subway deserves a review. Our office is within walking distance so I make it here once or twice a week. 5 dollar sandwiches, holler at your acquaintance. The staff here is very friendly and they don't forget what kind of cheese you want 5 seconds after you tell them. Greetings goodbyes and smiles every time. Best subway if not fast food restaurant in Scottsdale.",2
"After purchasing a daily deal here I did a month of yoga going about 4 or 5 times a week. The instructors are great and I felt amazing after every class. The downside is that the studio seems a little dirty and always had a stinky foot odor in the studio due to the carpet and sweat combo that goes on. Yikes. Also, I am not sure Bikram is for me because of the strictness of the practice. I desperately missed my down dogs. So as this studio is not for me it is worth a try if you are interested in hot yoga.",1
"First, my family arrived at 2 45 to check in checking time is listed as 3pm . We were told that there were no rooms available. We did not get a room until almost 5pm. This was after a long day of travel, so we did not start off our stay happy with the service. But it only got worse from there. n nThe pool, where we spent out 2 hours waiting, was nice enough, if it weren't for the fact that there were 20 30 drunk 20 something singles hitting on each other in it. Apparently the pool at this hotel is a popular local weekend hangout. Locals buy day passes and then spend the day drinking in the pool. Fun, if your part of the crowd. Not so fun if your a paying hotel guest with kids who keep getting pushed around and bumped by drunk sexed up hipsters. n nWe are a family with 2 children under 7, and the room we were assigned after a 2 hour delay, was on the second floor overlooking the pool. As I said, the pool is mostly filled with non hotel guests single hipsters who come for the day to hang out, hit on other hipsters, and to order drinks in the pool so it's not an ideal child environment. Also, it's loud, and it's open late, so we asked to have our room moved so that our kids could get to bed early that night for our 6am flight the next morning. n nThere was no offer by the front desk to help move our luggage into the new ""quieter "" room. we had to come downstairs to fetch the new room keys and turn in the old keys. The new room seemed fine nothing special small and uninviting, but there were the basics 2 beds, a tv. . We could hear some noise, but it wasn't too loud, and we assumed that the noise was from the room below us, and that it would die down by evening. So, we went to dinner. When we got back to the room we watched a movie together. After the movie, the kids went to bed. As soon as the movie stopped playing, we could still hear noise from downstairs, but it still wasn't too bad and the kids were quickly asleep after a long day of travel. n nThe problem arose when, after many hours, the noise not only did not go away, but got much, much louder. It turned out that the front desk person, who was so kind as to move us out of the loud poolside room, so that our family could get to bed early for our flight the next am, had moved us into a room directly above the very popular bar restaurant. The kids were asleep, so it was too late to call down for another room by the time we realized how the front desk person has screwed us. So, my wife and I were kept awake until well after 1am by the increasingly loud noise from the bar restaurant directly below our room. We fell asleep sometime between 1 and 2 am, and then had to wake up just after 4am to catch out flight the next morning. n nThis was the worst night either my wife or I have ever had in a hotel. We felt trapped, cheated, abused and completely disregarded as guests of this hotel. In fact, this really isn't a hotel. It's really a restaurant poolside pickup bar, which also happens to have rooms with people trying to sleep upstairs. n nI think that anyone looking for a hip, singles, pool bar would probably enjoy this place. If you're an actual traveler, or a family passing through, then by ALL means, look elsewhere. This place does not care about you or your family, and they are not catering to your needs. n nPS When I called down to ask if the hotel had rollaway beds or cots, the front desk person literally told me that she had no idea what I was talking about. Rollaway beds are an amenity found in a majority of hotels, but for this hotel to not even know what a rollaway bed or cot even is says a lot about the fact that they have no interest in catering to families. n nUPDATE To their credit, the owner of the hotel called me after I emailed my review to the hotel. He was very gracious and offered a full refund due to our poor experience. So, for the follow up of the owner, and his apology, I'm giving the hotel 2 stars instead of the original one star review I left. However, I still don't recommend this hotel to families.",1
"Amazing! Went for dinner last night for a birthday celebration and it was wonderful. It has a great mix and variety of food from France, Spain and Italy YUM! as well as a great selection of wines YUM! YUM! . Our server was fantastic! He and the entire staff were extremely attentive, friendly and personable. He brought us an amazing vanilla panna cotta with caramel that was absolutely delicious for our celebration. n nThey have a great happy hour that I have been to before and plan on going back to. This one is a MUST try if you are in the area and worth the drive if you're not. Buon Appetito!",2
"I have stayed in many Fairmonts over the years. This rates as a nice one. Top staff and nice building. It's newer as opposed to the old grande dame canadian resort legacy hotels. good restaurants, staff, gym, spa and views! Highly recommend if you end up in Pittsburgh!",2
"My brother took me here when I was out visiting. He really liked this place so we went here. I ordered the green chili and corn tamales and loved them! They had a kind of sweet and spicy taste to them. They were soft and delicious! This place is a little pricey, but very tasty and awesome service! We sat outside and there is a really nice waiter out there but I cannot remember her name. I would love to go here again the next time I visit AZ. nP.S. my brother is a crazy white boy.",2
"Love me some Arai Bakery. n nMy wife is from Japan, so we pretty much come here weekly. It has become the only place were we buy birthday cakes since my wife moved to the Phoenix area 13 years ago. Kind of pricey but ohh so good. n nThe bread they make there also can't be beat. The word on the street is that since Ichiro Suzuki started spring training in AZ that he has the bread express delivered too him weekly. As a side note you can make the absolute best grill cheese sandwich with Arai white bread. Mmmmh bread! n nCream Pan, Curry Pan, An Pan filled with anko bean paste which is an acquired taste are all really good. Arai san is truly an artisan who takes great pride in his work. Consistently delicious baked goods",2
"Late lunch 1 26 10 nTheir clam chowder is out of this world! I kid you not the best clam chowder I've ever eaten. Hubby says it's only second best 1st was his dad's homemade. Quite a compliment! However, the service was HORRIBLE. Two servers with 3 tables of customers. All the servers did was chat with each other. Never once checked on us or any other table. Two bowls of clam chower, 1 beer 17.55 no tip. nFood 5 stars nService 0 stars",2
"This place is hit and miss, but when its good its REALLY good.",2
"I must say, we are pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. We've only been twice but both times our party has been really happy with the food. We've tried broiled fish, scallops, shrimp, steak and fried fish. Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly. We think they skimp in some areas salad bar, decor to compensate for the quality entrees, work for us! Oh and the service has always been efficient and friendly.",2
"We arrived in Henderson after a day at Bryce Canyon. We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn and we quite hungry. Thanks to Yelp I spotted great reviews for this Greek Restaurant which turned out to be across the street. We came to the little restaurant that had some tables inside but chose to sit outside as it was on the cooler side inside. My 2 children ordered the large Greek salads that came with hot, toasted pita wedges. My husband and I each ordered the chicken souvlaki platter that came with small Greek salads, rice pilaf and the pita wedges. The chicken was really flavorful and my picky 17 year old proclaimed, ""that's the best chicken I've ever tasted! "" The salads were delicious and very crisp and fresh! My daughter also ordered a baklava for dessert to eat back at the hotel and it was gobbled up. she loved it and normally doesn't like nuts . We loved our meal and wish they were by our home in Phoenix. I also have to add that the woman who took our order was super friendly and cheerful. The food was quickly served nice and hot!",2
"Shockingly bad. It only cost 75 for two nights so that is the ONLY redeeming aspect of the experience. Normally in Vegas the hotel is part of the fun. This place was dirty, I mean DIRTy, run down, smelled bad, lots of different bad smells depending on the location in the hotel. The tub water backed up and didn't drain properly. If you're getting it for next to nothing and you for care at all about the quality of the hotel, then go for it. Otherwise, BEWARE",1
"As a seasonal resident of AZ, this is the very first restaurant that was so poor that I felt compelled to comment on. n nWell I thought I'd give CK another try after 2 disappointing visits. So for a late bite we arrived around 9 30 pm, the place was dead, staff talking amongst themselves, smelled great and asked to sit on the patio. The Hostess tried to sit us where it would be convenient for the server, but we chose a more intimate area and got a vibe like we might be asking for something out of the ordinary. We were coldly greeted by our server, who looked similar to every other server, young, averagely attractive, no visible outstanding qualities. Yes, I work in a seasonal food service business and hire and fire these clones daily. Anyway, this is our mediocre apathetic workforce of today. We received our wine and I noticed my wine glass was dirty or smudged. I decided to just let it go, but as I thought about it and the level of detail I require in my own business, I decided to ask for a new glass, but only once our food had arrived, fearing kitchen reprisal. The server brought our food, and I asked for the new glass, pointing out the smudge, which she immediately snatched up the glass, noted the smudge and left the table without one word. Now onto the food, well where do I begin, poor plate presentation even for a 12 veggie burger, very anemic like the server. Oh, no utensils or napkins or even an offer of water. I waited a few minutes and decided to get my own utensils, which were neatly wrapped in a napkin by the patio door. I turned the bun onto the veggie patty and it is cold and I decide I will not eat this, it is beneath me and how can someone serve something so pathetic and get away with it. When the server checked on us, I told her I wasn't happy and explained that I thought the bun should be toasted and her attitude was its not our policy to toast the bun and I should specify how I want my bun. With this I asked for a credit to my bill and she took the plate, turned and curtly walked away. Once again, no apology or attempt to rectify the complaint, only a confrontation that I the one paying her salary was some how responsible. We left with no parting adieu, never to return. We drove to their sister venue, Postino, which for the second time we had a great experience. Staff were personable, professional and uncloned. As for CK, go if you like camouflaged mediocrity, enjoy being snubbed by the people who are suppose to serve you and paying for it. I'll take mine at the S M.",1
"To have lived a life knowing that nothing was left on the table. That's what I imagine deathbed Eric saying as he looks back on a fulfilled life. Well, all that went to hell after I ate at this just awful place. n nA couple buddies and I decided to come her before heading out on the town. Considering we generally subscribe to the dives and hole in the walls with good food mindset when it comes to food, we thought a restaurant by the host of a similarly named show would work splendidly. We were so wrong. I think about those hole in the walls that have created a name for themselves based off of a passion for quality of food. When I think of the exact opposite, Guy Fieri's comes to mind. The food was largely bland and unimaginative. For as much as he has seemingly experienced, I was expecting a lot more. I can only imagine that they provide so much food so that the sure to follow food coma dismisses all potential of motivation for negative thoughts. n nFood aside, I do have to give a lot of credit to the staff. My friend's water glass broke mid drink. Literally. The bottom fell from the glass while he was drinking, and, well you can imagine what happened from that. Sheer pandemonium of course. Women were screaming. Kids were crying. Cars were burning. It was mass chaos. No not really.it was just inconvenient. The manager, whom I did not notice prior, was on it in a heartbeat. He was over to our table in what seemed like a matter of seconds apologizing. On top of that, he even managed to comp a meal, a couple beers, and give a free desert for the table. That attentiveness was impressive. n nThough the service was excellent, there isn't much that would bring me back here.",1
"Came here one evening accidentally during happy hour to satisfy a massive sushi craving and was not disappointed! I moved back to Phoenix after a year long stay in Los Angeles and after finding the best sushi restaurant ever Toshi Sushi in Silverlake , I was very wary of the sushi here. I tried Ra over in Tempe and thought it was only okay. And, not wanting to drive all the way across the valley for only decent sushi, looked for places closer to the western part of town. n nService was nothing exceptional or memorable, waitress was sweet though. I think next time we'll try sitting at the bar. We ordered quite a variety, most notably the spicy tuna rolls amaaazing , and a few specialty ones that I can't remember. Definitely good enough to come back, especially with happy hour prices! n nIt's a little bit hard to find and a little far away from me, but worth it in the end! I'd definitely recommend it.",2
"Do you know how this facility has so many 5 star reviews? n nThey have a raffle every couple of months for those parents that leave ""5 STAR "" reviews for this facility and the winner gets a free week of tuition! Very sad indeed! n nI have to say that two teachers in this facility are good with children, but the rest especially Dana Becky treat your kids very harsh, especially if you are not around. I was standing behind the wall once and heard Dana yelling very loudly at this poor 2 year old child. 5 Minutes later when his dad was picking up the same child, he was been treated like a Prince and that is definitely wrong! n nThere is little teacher student interaction at this facility. At times, I felt that the teachers were burnt out and were looking forward to Friday on a Monday morning. One of the teachers explicitly told me at 10 30 am on Monday that she can't wait for Friday and she is tired of hearing kids wining. I understand that we all have bad days, but at least keep such comments to yourself . n nMy child is no longer attending this school and I encourage you not to be deceived by the fake smiles that most the staff at La Petite Academy give you. There are at least 3 better daycares in the near vicinity. As a parent, please do your homework before enrolling your children in a daycare.",1
"Saw WuTang last month and Lauryn Hill last night. n nMy fave part of HOB is that it's small. nSucks to be downstairs like I was for Lauryn but, thankfully, it wasn't that crowded. Made it easier to walk in thru. nWatching WuTang from the top was great. We had seats, there was no one taller than me, and it wasn't crowded.",2
"I was disappointed with the great reviews from other people. n nI ordered Pho, Vietnamese Springrolls and Eggrolls. The broth for the Pho was very salty, the eggrolls were burnt and looked old as if been previously refrigerated , and the springrolls had way too much vegetables and very little noodles and a small hint of meat and shrimp. n nI was clearly disappointed. I will not go back here. n nTwo stars for friendly service and clean restaurant.",1
Don't bother coming here. The drinks are expensive and they charge you per ice cube. Yes they charge you for ice.,1
"Tourist trap! n nSuperb location and nice settings. Food is barely OK, and service is very amateur. The tartare had been ""proceed "" to finely, a long time ago. There are now good alternative around there. OK for a drink outdoors and the fried calamari is decent. Walk a block around for your meal.",1
"I've lived in Phoenix pretty much my whole life. I've had quite a few breakfast burritos, from the categories of ""I hate my life so much right now and I'm going to hate it more after this something bertos awfulness I'll eat so I can at least live through this morning, "" all the way to burritos lovingly homemade with the many fresh ingredients cut up and grilled in front of me. n nAll that said The breakfast burritos here are The Best. If I'm not out of town, I'm here at least once a weekend. Doesn't matter if it's 10am or 3pm, some day that weekend I'm devouring a breakfast burrito here. The potatoes eggs are cooked in just the right way and amount that they're guaranteed to slay any hunger or hangover you may walk in with. The ham sausage options are excellent, but my heart will forever be caught in the ages old battle waged between bacon and chorizo chorizo usually wins . The red salsa just completes the masterpiece. n nNot to mention, the managers owners are kickass. If they know you, they'll probably know if you need some water, how much salsa you need, and if you want chips without even saying it in the morning ish . And sometimes they'll sit down and chat with you over their own burrito. n nI've grabbed tacos here a few times as well, and they're also excellent. I can't imagine these guys doing anything average.",2
"First time dining at Binkley's and it was virtually perfect. Environment is comfortable, attractive, and unobtrusive. Same with service warm and available yet never over bearing. The food was completely terrific really creative and memorable every single dish was good though halibut in parchment stood out especially. I love Kai and Elements and would hurry to go back there for the great service and gorgeous setting, but, in terms of the sheer quality of the food, Binkley's is the best restaurant in Phoenix. I am only sorry that it is SO expensive 110. per person with only 2 glasses of wine for 1 of us that we won't be able to dine here more frequently. Outstanding. Do not hesitate to go to Binkley's.",2
"Pros Great and various food, attentive service, interesting decor n nCons Not much except that you're in Pittsburgh not where I live now! n nTell me if I can find a place like this in the SF Bay Area. I miss you, Zenith Tea Room! n nI have only come here for the Sunday brunch which starts at 11 am. This is one of the hidden treasures of Pittsburgh. The entire brunch is vegan and also dangerously unhealthy read tons of sugary treats . The buffet is flat rate which includes the buffet, a choice of tea drink and main dish such as vegan french toast, if that's possible it's so awesome . n nFOR TEN DOLLARS! n nThey use mismatched antiquey dishware and silverware. And even the chairs don't match! So in some way, it's like dining in an attic, but everything is tastefully selected. Of course, this place being in the Southside means it's mostly hipsters that come this way. But an incredible gem this is. It's easy to get a table for less than 4.but huge parties, expect to wait. n nI really need to come back here just for tea there. They have an incredible tea list. I personally love the darjeeling, but that's the staple for me.",2
I came here because of a sharp pain in my neck along with some tightness discomfort in my upper back. I painfully suffered through 3 weeks before coming to see Dr. Johnson. n nDr. Johnson is one of the most professional and knowledgeable doctors I've ever worked with. He was able to release some of the tightness in my back and diagnose my neck pain. I walked out feeling far better than when I walked in. This is the place to go! I had a great experience and highly recommend him!,2
"The Good So this place has excellent yogurt. Its creamy, never gritty, and the flavors are fun and forever changing. I have been going here for nearly 15 years and I'm never disappointed in the yogurt. Its wonderful! n nThe Bad This is the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. First, they only take cash. I'm someone who never carries cash so it makes it inconvenient to have to remember to bring some. Second, no longer do you see the family members working there with their friendly faces but instead are these high school teens that don't care about their job and talk about their high school drama instead of showing some courtesy to the customers. Lastly they don't have a lot of toppings to choose from and I feel they're a bit pricey so I never get them. n nFor years I refused to get yogurt anywhere else because MFY was sooo good I didn't like any other shops but alas I have ventured and found other great places that are doing a better job at creating creamy yogurt. I'll still go there every so often when I'm in the area but nowadays I seem to like other places a bit better but its still very much worth a try. n nFYI, they're not open on Sundays! I used to always forget about that!",2
The monday friday lunch special is hands down THE BEST VALUE on the strip this is coming from a Las Vegas resident who's literally been everywhere! The food is always top notch matched by immaculate presentation and service to boot! If you can get a table it's a no brainer during your stay in Vegas.,2
Not bad. I honestly don't know what else needs to be said about this place. Customer service has been great so far. Would come again occasionally.,2
"I really like this place! Nice atmosphere, pretty good service, and great food. The space is smallish about 15 tables , and you might have a wait on a weekend night, but they move quick enough. n nThe food is really good and the portions are more than enough. We've tried several pastas the carbonara is fantastic , the eggplant and the chicken parmigiana, and some seafood dishes. Always consistently tasty. I really like the red sauce flavorful and slightly sweet, which is up my alley. n nGood place for an easy, casual meal. Family friendly but also good for a date, somehow. I believe they deliver, too.",2
"Amazing food. Took a while to get our food but when we did. It was so good. I got the Baja fish, crunchy, and dorado tacos and a house margarita on the rocks. They were on point, and the margarita definitely had a kick to it. I had to order another Baja fish taco because it was so good. Everything tasted super fresh! I would definitely recommend this place. They have great food and a fun atmosphere. I will definitely be back soon.",2
"Great hotel. Probably best for business people. It's not surrounded by tourist attractions but it's conveniently located right near public transportation. nThe decor is nothing noteworthy. I liked the comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, microwave and mini fridge. I've been to hotels that charge hundreds more and didn't even have a fridge or microwave. Breakfast buffet 12 person was good. nThe only thing is, I noticed a few spots that look like housekeeping never cleans them i.e. the shower head and faucets were turning a little green and or rusty.",2
"Always a good time here. The staff is friendly and very welcoming. Never more than a 2 min wait to get a table if there's even a wait. n nFood is always on point and even better the portions are all family sized! So be careful when ordering for 2, unless like me and my girl we tend to order for 4 anyway. n n nTip leave room to try the tira mi su it's worth it!",2
AYCE sushi awesomeness! We came for lunch and yes there was a wait so be prepared. n nThe fish quality is not top notch but it is it fresh and good enough. There is a sufficient amount of rice. I like that they would add quail eggs as you request! n nThe rolls are good too but it is filling. You can request for 1 2 roll so you can try more stuffs. n nThey gave me a rose at the end of the meal because it was mother's day weekend. how sweet!,2
"Very disappointing experience. It looks like a nice cafe with a terrasse. But it was horrible. Here's why n1. We were asked to move after sitting down outside for 15 min because the hostess didn't bother to ask if we were eating or just having drinks. I don't even know why we had to move for eating, but we didn't want to be complicated so we agreed to move. n2. The waiter had no knowledge of his alcoholic menu. I ordered sangria and he said he didn't have sangria. Asked for an old fashion and he had no idea what I was talking about. Ordered a cosmopolitan and he asked if I wanted a vodka or gin martini. I was so confused over just a drink! n3. The only good part of my dinner was the appetizer. Tuna tar tar. No complaints there. Fish was fine. Nothing out of the norm, it was good. n4. We arrived at 5 ish and received our main dish at almost 630. We were unable to find our waiter several times. Appetizer dishes not cleared, my empty cosmo was only offered a refill at the end of my meal so I said no. And obviously couldn't find him for the bill and even when we did, he took so long I had to leave to get my car while my friend had to front my part for the bill. n5. Not only did my food take forever to come, it tasted horrible! It was WAY too salty my brocolini with sausage. All I did was drink water after almost ever bite because we had to leave by 7 and if I returned it, we would have to wait another 45 min probably. My friend's pork stuffed with blue cheese lacked blue cheese AND was over cooked. Was way too dry. n nThis restaurant is worth one star but i will give them their one credit, their appetizer was par. n nWill I come back? Never",1
"I had high hopes for this place. I'd heard that Barrio had won awards and was a must go place. My lady and I live close by so we decided to try it out. The wait was 45 minutes which was fine. We walked around and saw the artwork and the murals along 16th street and had a nice wait. When we were seated, we ordered drinks, the waiter mumbled a bit, and got them. This is the highlight of the meal. The beer was cold. After that, the waiter would meander by and mumble things like ""Yokay? "" and ""Howboutmore? "" before walking away, not waiting for a response. The food came, I had the Pollo Poblano, and I have never had a drier piece of chicken nor as flavorless a sauce. We get the check and.well, save yourself the money and buy a tank of gas to drive somewhere else to eat.",1
"The area is cute and the menu is good. Parking was relatively easy. The restaurant is pretty small but appeared cute and intimate. With all that said, we ordered take out, which was mediocre and waaaay overpriced for what was given. It really wasn't very good cold and mushy . Pretty disappointed.",1
"I have been craving some GOOD soulfood since moving here from California in July and after several weeks of google and yelp, Ezekiel's was high on the list of places to try out. So this past Saturday, I was finally able to go there and I ordered the Fried Chicken Lunch meal with 3 sides mac cheese, greens and sweet potatoes and needless to say, I was beyond dissapointed. The greens taste like sugar, the mac cheese was just the mac not cheesy at all and the sweet potatoes were a mush of burnt sweet potatoes with a pound of nutmeg on top. The fried chicken was ok but definitely not what I am used too. I would prefer Albertson's chicken over Ezekiel's anyday. The best part of the meal was the sprite that helped wash down the dissapointment. I should of read between the lines when I walked in and the place was empty. It's back to the drawing board for me. I think it is safe to say that AZ is definitely slacking in the food department.",1
"This is the largest D C boutique for women and men to open in the US. It is located inside beautiful Crystals within the CityCenter complex. Everything here is laid out beautifully, and it has been pretty close to heaven on earth as far as shopping is concern. Just looking at the store and the store front made of glass, showcasing the brand's traditional elements dresses, handbags illuminated by bright lights women's store or slick suits men's side , felt like I was at a museum for contemporary fashion. n nI found out about this newly opened D C location, and decided to drop in while checking out what Chinese New Year decor has been put up in Crystals and other nearby casinos. I was very impressed with the look and layout of the store, which features apparel, accessories and fine jewelry. n nQian, one of the sales associate women's was very friendly and told me about the men's store that is also soon to debut inside Crystals, and it is supposed to be even bigger! I can't wait to shop at what will top the current reigning D C women's boutique flagship store, occupying 65,000 squared feet of luxury retail space. n n UPDATE 3 4 2012 nCame here late last week, since I was early for dinner with Yelpers. I didn't intend to buy anything, but to see what suits and other items are at the men's D G store. And they do have some very nice suits. n nService is great. Very attentive. If more sales associates were helping and someone ordered pizzas, it would be like the scene from Pretty Women. n nPrice as expected is in the luxury arena, but they do have sales twice a year. Which I am looking forward to, now that I am on their contact list.",2
"I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant we were really hungry and just needed somewhere to eat that wasn't fast food or required trendy wear. But the food was really bad. I had the rosemary chicken with roasted vegetables and potatoes. The chicken was so dry and had no flavor, even the dark meat wasn't very good. The few pieces of carrots that were there were still partially raw. The service was very good though.",1
"This is a rare find in Las Vegas. Firstly some of the reviews on Yelp have the wrong Hilton Hotel. I would like to say a special thank you to the Hilton Garden Inn for looking after my special quests. Group Booking Manager Katie Sommers went out of her way to take care of our group of people who have special needs due to being handicapped. This venue is quiet, accommodating and very kind. They add a lot of extra's most hotels and casinos charge for. Coffee and tea station and fridge. The rooms for the handicapped are wonderful. It's a home away from home for those who want to escape the crazy and large casinos filled with noise, smoke and chaos. They have a fantastic banquet room with a beautiful outside garden area for parties and events etc called The Hawaiian Gardens. This hotel is only five minutes on the southside of the strip a hop skip and jump. free shuttles all day and night. This hotel is right next door to the outlet mall and restaurants. You won't get lost looking for your room, get frustrated with the typical average poor customer service nor feel that no ones cares about your needs. They are a five star venue. Thank you again to the management team Katie, Linda and Steven. Survivor's Pay it Forward and The Beyond Trauma Foundation appreciate your consideration and extra special care in taking care of our guests from around the nation.",2
"I should have known better to go to Uno anywhere other than Chicago, but it was late and I was hungry. n nService was fine.I don't know what to say.expensive, restaurant should have been MUCH cleaner considering there was only about 10 people there.",1
"This is THE SPOT for all waxing needs, ESPECIALLY Brazilian. This is like the only place in town that uses hard wax and holy guacamole does that make a difference. Not only does it remove the hair more thoroughly, its less painful and safer for the skin. I get less ingrown hairs and my skin never lifts. I have used many waxers in here, Meghan is my fave. I'm not shy and enjoy some rather risque and satiracle conversation during my wax to help keep my mind off it, and Meg doesn't skip a beat. This place is the bee's knees.",2
The best donut shop in Arizona. Hands down.,2
"I love! Love! Love! Apple Mac products, but when a cox tech came into my home accused me of killing their hard drive on their DVR and then went into my Mac laptop after this store put in a new opperating system a couple months before I thought they would support their product and not be a corporate butt kisser and side with cox. But minutes after the tech left I found the computer was left on, when I correctly logged off and turned off my computer and tried to turn the computer it would not boot up. I then took my laptop to this store. My laptop was in this stores trusted hand with their supposed geniuses and they could not even start up my laptop. Three days later I came in picked up my now dead computer and left. About a week later I went to the locally owned I store and they started up mu laptop with a disc but I was told that my hard drive was dying. With still no support from the Corperate butt kissers I called apple tech support and asked if it was possible for a cox tech to kill my computer and finally got a semi straight answer as it is possible. The moral of this review is that I will always buy Apple Mac products because of their superior technology, but will not trust their corporate minded people to go to bat for me when it comes to them standing up against other corporations and not the people that they depend on for their bread and butter. I am disabled and can not afford to pay thousands of dollars for a replacement computer. I am on the other hand going to take cox communication to court. And I have never lost in any case I have brought to court! Wish me luck. n Suzanne Ciskowski",1
"This is the Fat Tuesday at Caesar's Palace, right? n n5 stars for the drink at all Fat Tuesdays. But 2 stars for service at this particular one. There wasn't a line, it wasn't very busy. Bartender was very short with me. I asked for a peach bellini. She looked at me like an idiot for not showing her my ID first. She took a look and rudely asked if I wanted an extra shot. Yes, please. Paid, and left. n nAll other Fat Tuesdays I've been to gave me service like there wasn't a line even at Planet Hollywood where there's aaaaalways a line! Mehhh! I'll come back if I'm at Caesar's Palace, but this was the worst one I've been to.",1
Overrated and expensive with spotty service.,1
"Expect to wait for a really long time in the drive thru, especially at night.",1
Also the best experience since I have been in Phoenix.,2
We were so excited to try their burgers so we made the 30 min drive. I was shocked to find out that they were in a dirty gas station. To play it safe I ordered one before I ordered for the whole family. Took a bite and it tasted like a microwaved burger super gross. We ended up driving to in and out totally disappointed.,1
It was my first time zip lining and it was such an awesome experience. Definitely a very short ride. The waiting was a bit too long and it was very hot. Overall it was good. n nPrice 20.00 nExperience was great. nRide was about 5 seconds. nStaff was great.,2
"45 minute wait. Worth it? Absolutely not. The food took long to come out. I started off with the pork belly bun. The pork belly had nice flavor to it, thus the 2 star. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star. Pork belly was good, but the ratio of meat to veggie and bun was absurd. Tried the farm burger along with all 3 different fries. I thought the patty was a little flavorless and the overall taste did not meet my expectations of going to a world renown chef. Looks like that place needs hells kitchen!",1
"By far the worst experience at Macaroni Grill that we've ever had. For starters we had to ask for bread twice and when we finally got it, we didn't even have starter plates. Next we waited on our server multiple times, server never came by after food was served, wife's pasta noodles were undercooked and her portion size was made for a kid. We always order same thing so usually everything is pretty much the same not including this time. Last but not least, it seemed like everyone hated their lives minus hostess and weren't happy to help any customers. Also the cooks were banging stuff around which didn't help the experience. n nWe won't be back to this location!",1
"I'm around this part of the UW campus all the time, so I stop here maybe once or twice a week. The coffee is consistent and quite good their roasts come from a local co op called Just Coffee. I can't speak for the sandwiches lunch menu because I've never dined here, but I do like the pastries the usual coffee house suspects like muffins, scones, cookies. Some of the varieties are atypical blackberry scones, ginger pear muffins, and the like. n nMy favorite part the exterior wall is usually pulled back on a nice day, making everything open air. A nice place to sit in the morning to do some reading or people watch.",2
"The first time I came to SeaBlue was mid 2010, I think. My posse was up in one of our suites, waiting on the girls to get ready. I sat down and had some oysters. Then some more. And then some more. Man, those were some good oysters! n nEventually, I decided to just order dinner it was some kind of tastings menu? I remember chopped sashimi, pine nuts, vinegrette, a few other things. It was fantastic and I made a mental note to make sure I came back the next time I was in Vegas. n nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago. Back at the MGM Sig again, with a date and some friends. Back to SeaBlue, which was unfortunately no longer doing the tastings set. No big, surely the rest of their dinner menu would be of equal quality! We ordered several appetizers four different ones, as I recall. They were tiny a bite ish per appetizer, maybe 4 to a plate , and not terribly flavorful. This includes the mini lobster things. n nWhen dinner came by, I had some kind of fish stew served over rice, which was mediocre at best. My buddy Charlie had their steak and it looked okay his wife had some kind of Firecracker Lobster, and it looked pretty good? n nWhen it comes down to it, it just wasn't worth the money spent there are far better restaurants in Vegas. They did have a nice variety of oysters, so I suppose I'd recommend you chill at the bar and have some oysters and a beer, but don't bother with the meals. n nIf you want sushi sashimi I would recommend Social House, but I have not been to their new location in the Aria. It was absolutely glorious when still housed in Treasure Island.",1
Get dumpling pot stickers they are the best! Great!,2
"try their appetizer of steamed mussels and their excellent bread pudding huge portion . Their bread was mediocre. I couldn't remember what seafood pasta I ordered it was satisfactory but not a surprise. n nThe manager is very nice while the cook has a funny attitude. We went there craving for bread pudding at 5p right after they opened. As the waitress submitted our order to the chef, he said, ""we don't serve desert at 5. "" Anyway, we got our sweet tooth satisfied along with some tea for an hr. n nI give 4 stars for the atmosphere and the menu selection.",2
"Very friendly service and a great dining experience. Wr sat outside which was very nice. The pizza was probably a 3 or 4 star but the service and atmosphere makes up the difference. And a plus, they serve Coke products. And there are not too mancy choices in Verado.",2
"WARNING! YELP REVIEW IS INFLATED! n n nIf you show them your yelp review they give you 10 off your bill so I'm giving one star to offset all the fake 5s. Food quality is roughly a 2. Everything here is basically ordered a la cart which is fine but it all ends up tasting the same. Anything fried in a decent tasting batter is hard to screw up. The menu is a labyrinth of jumbled words. n nThe food quality was average and was cooked by a chef who looked so miserable I felt he was only moments away from sticking his head into the boiling pot of oil. n nWas not worth the time, money or calories. nWe ended up leaving and going elsewhere for dinner",1
"They have a great Cornish pasty for only 4. It's a very good size and is a meal in itself. n nIt's not a U.P. style pasty with rutabaga and such but has ground beef, potato, and onion. nThey also carry do breakfast pies, cheesy pasties but for me it's the ground beef. nThere's no seating however so plan accordingly. Closed Sundays too.",2
They had to take my transmission apart for a shifting issue. 1. 5 weeks later my check engine light is on and the battery won't hold a charge. Nobody is answering the phone. I don't want to buy a brand new battery if it's an engine issue. I had no other issues before I brought it in.,1
"While I have absolutely no complaints about the food, this review is for the service received. n nThe first time I received disrespectful service when I went with my best friend, I spoke to the manager about it and let it go. Now that this has happened again, I'm letting fellow Yelpers know. n nI went in with my boyfriend on a Monday around 2pm, it was not busy, yet there was no one there to greet us nor sit us down at a table. After standing there and seeing the other servers look at us, my boyfriend had to walk up to the bar and ask for help. It was only then that a guy came out from behind the bar to sit us down at a table. As he returned to the bar it took another few minutes before a girl came around to bring us two glasses of water and walk away. That was it, no greeting whatsoever! n nWhen we finally were able to order our food, the girl asked my boyfriend what kind of bread he wanted. As it was his first time there he didn't know what the options were and what the difference was between the breads. Instead of explaining it to him when he asked, the girl simply stared at him like he was stupid and asked again if he wanted chiabata or focaccia. So I had to explain it to him instead. TALK ABOUT BEING RUDE DISRESPECTFUL! n nThe rest of the time we were there, the only time we had any ""help "" from the servers was when they brought our food or refilled our water glasses. Not once did anyone say anything to us or ask if we needed anything. I wanted to ordered a drink but decided not to if they didn't even care to ask! n nNote I've never had an issue with the male staff servers but the females are excuse my language b es. They seriously need to hire female servers who are friendly and provide good customer service to EVERYONE!",1
"Amazing! n nI have been talking about getting a bikini wax for years but never did because I was too afraid that the pain would be so bad I would want to die. I had mentioned it to a co worker and she said that I should try Bliss for my first time she had mentioned that it was the least painful waxing she had ever had. Super nervous and only 5 days from my beachy honeymoon I decided that it was now or never I booked my appointment, and one more for a friend if I was going to be in pain, someone else would be too . n nIt was the week of my wedding and was out running last minute errands the morning of my appointment, I had lost track of time and realized that I was now running late. I was very worried that I was going to lose my appointment and pay for it, you leave a credit debit card when you book your appointment in case you don't show or cancel after the approved time frame, but was very relieved when the woman on the phone said she would just push it back 30 minutes. n nWe showed up at the spa, which is very easy to find, and was immediately greeted by a very friendly woman behind the front desk. She informed us that it would be just a moment before we would be taken back. 1 minute later we were escorted back to the waiting area by an even friendlier woman who asked about our service and tried to reassure us that it was the least painful waxes she has ever had. We waited anxiously before Keri called me to the room of doom where I was positive that I was going to have my skin peeled off all in the name of vanity. We stepped into the room where she informed me that I would be removing the clothing on my lower half and replacing it with a pair of sanitary underwear. Keri talked me through the whole process before starting and tried to ease my anxiety by telling me that it, again, was the least painful wax. She asked me which of the three services I had decided to get, you get your choice of how much you'd like them to take off, and I let her know that I would be getting the ""inbetweeny "". She reassured me that I had made a great choice for my first ever waxing experience and wouldn't be disappointed or want to die. n nThe whole experience from removing of clothes to putting them back on lasted all of 30 minutes and.drum roll please.was actually tolerable! The pain, I would rate a 5 7 out of 10, really wasn't that bad! Keri made it very comfortable and, dare I say it, almost pain free! The worst part of it all was the waiting and anxiety. n nI would, hands down, recommend this spa to anyone and everyone. The experience from start to finish was great.",2
"The food was really good . I'd like to say that first. I enjoyed the garlic knots very much. The sausage on the pizza was really tasty too. n nWhen we walked in there was no sign that said ""seat yourself "" as there should be. We stood there for a couple minutes feeling kind of silly. I finally walked up to the counter and told the lady we were there for dinner. She said we could seat ourselves. We quickly sat down at the only booth available when a small boy approached our table and sat down 2 cups and a plate of garlic knots, confused I asked him if we were in his seat. He turned around and walked away . Apparently they employ a 10 year old relative at this establishment . We waited about 13 minutes before we were acknowledged by a waitress who informed us we could fill our own cups from the fountain drink station. It seemed to take a long time to get our pizza. Someone did drop off a second plate of 6 garlic knots on the table while we were waiting though. When our food arrived it was explained to us that a portion of the pizza had fallen on the floor so they had to throw it away but we could start eating what she had brought to the table about three quarters of a pizza and a second would follow free of charge. We had just finished the first partial pizza when the second arrived. We were too full to eat any of it so we took it home with us. I was slightly disappointed when we reheated it the sauce had lost most of it's taste by the next day. Again, after finishing our food we waited a long time for a waitress to bring us our check. I told my husband to pay in cash because I didn't want to sit there and wait another 15 minutes for the waitress to pick up the check, another 15 minutes for her to run the credit card and return it to us. n nWe may go back because the pizza was really good but you better believe it'll be carry out only!",1
"I have been here 3 times in hopes of it being fantastic just one time. But honestly it never has. I tried 3 different steaks each time, their black tiger shrimp, their stuffed mushroom appetizer, their calamari, their goat cheese appetizer, and all were okay. Nothing to rave about. The best items out of all those listed were perhaps the calamari and the goat cheese. I have had WAY better steaks elsewhere. Not much flavor to them. For the prices I expected more. I probably won't be back. Service is great. But if you are looking for an awesome, melt in your mouth steak, this is not the place.",1
"This was our first time to an Indonesian resto and it won't be our last. Our server was helpful with describing the cuisine and making recommendations. We started with the beef and grilled fish cakes. Then on to shrimp and fish for our entrees. So yummy! We were even privileged to have the Indonesian ambassador dining there the same evening. When we return to Montreal, we'll eat there again.",2
I have been an ATNT customer for almost 9 years and have never had a problem with their customer service. except for this location. A couple days ago I came In and put my name down and waited for over 40 minutes before I was helped. I asked how many more people were in front of me and he said 4. I left after I heard that cause I don't have another hour to waste. n nThen today I went in and sat down for over 15 minutes without anyone even greeting me or putting my name down. I asked if I could putt my name down and a nice girl said there was a guy that was suppose to do it. Ok? Well I could only see 2 employees and there must have been over 25 customers in the store. All looking disgruntled and tired of waiting. Right as I was about to leave a man came up and told the girl he had waited an hour and that he was leaving disappointed. I said the same thing! Ridiculous. Being a business owner myself I can't believe this kind of thing is going on every day in there. Where is the manager? I doubt if I Renew my contract. Sorry! Ain't no body got time for that!,1
"Only had 2 dollar beers on Tuesday. ,7oz.That's what a sign said on the curb, so i was sold. MISTAKE n Found it waiting for my flowers to be made at the bud and vine which SUCKED ASS TOO n Found this place by just walking around wasting time. nBartender NOT too friendly unless your her regulars is the feeling I got, and I live here, also a bartender myself. I left myself Open for conversation also. I didn't get face down on the phone for that reason, to leave myself open for conversation or maybe she would offer me a menu? NOPE!. n Still, so she proved they don't need new faces here. Must be nice not to need my money. Ty I WILL NOT RETURN",1
"Congratulations Sushi 101. You are my first one star review. I have high standards for this category and you get to go down in my Yelp history as breaking my 1 star cherry. n nThis is the WORST sushi I have ever had. I would rather eat the stuff from Kyoto Bowl. In fact, in comparison Kyoto bowl sounds rather delicious to me at the moment, that is if you didn't turn me off from sushi altogether. n nHappy hour schmappy hour, I can't believe people pay to eat this crap. n nOn top of that the service was awful. I had a beer and finished it not half way into my time there and was never asked if I wanted another. n nAfter that I find on my bill they factored gratuity into my tip. The only time I know this to be a common practice is for groups of 6 or more. There were five of us. I think they have to build in the tip because they know they are awful and wouldn't make any money otherwise. n nCollege kids, I know you don't have much money but trust me, there are plenty of decent or even great sushi places out there that offer amazing HH deals. n nI cringe to think of how many kids will have their first sushi experience here and will never know how truly delicious and amazing sushi actually is.",1
"Well, this was my first time in Gilbert and my friend Amy took me here after we were off roading all afternoon and it was nice to pull into this chill laid back spot. n nThey have a good selection of wine beer and the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced too. I didn't get to try the carrot cake or red velvet cakes which looked delectable but heard that they both rocked so I'll have to check those out on my return visit whenever that might be.",2
"Worst front desk staff ever. I books my room in July for a conference in Oct, and only upon arrival was I told that they moved me to Fairfield Inn. HORRIBLE",1
"Pretty vast selection of fabrics, and patterns. Unfortunately, the stock of the patterns is always a hit or miss. n nThe people that work here are lazy and rude, I only give this place stars cause it's the only place in town to get good fabric.",2
"The first ""true "" hot wings I have ever eaten. The Rim Reaper is no joke and there will be consequences in the bathroom the following day!",2
"Let me just say I LOVE this salon! I went in yesterday to get my nails re done because the last job I had was horrible, and I came out AMAZED with the work. I have known Marisa the nail tech since grade school, but had not work done by her. This salon is so clean, and the staff is incredibly sweet! Marisa took her time with my nails, and they came out as the best set I have ever had, and I have been getting my nails done for well over 8 years. I received 30 off my first visit which was great! They definitely care about their clients, and the work they do! If you really want quality work done, then go here! You can have quality work for cheap! They're prices are a little higher than most places, however the work they do is well worth the cost trust me! They also have a membership package!",2
"Absolutely Horrible Experience! On July 10 my family dined here, I regret it and won't return. Their exhaust system in the kitchen broke and the entire dining room was full of exhaust smoke. It is a health hazard to breath that and it is a fire hazard also. Their women's restroom was disgusting. Garbage overflowing, no toilet paper or paper towels. I have ate here several times but won't return after this visit. I wasted 35 on a un enjoyable experience. The owner was present that night, He should have had the integrity of a business owner to close for the night.",1
"If you're looking for fresh, local meat in the area, this is this place. I had seen the place many times but did not realize all their meat comes from a Union County farm. I stopped in and got a big steak for NYE dinner, and it was delicious. The guy working maybe the owner said to put only salt and pepper on it and that was the right call. The price was reasonable for the quality of steak. They also have package deals available, similar to Omaha Steaks, but the meat is far superior here.",2
We waited much too long after we sat down you seat yourself and we watched 3 workers look up at us and watch us sit down. The food took awhile and was not that good AND there was a discrepancy on the bill. Definitely wouldn't go back. n nOh AND it was super sketchy at the front it said ring doorbell when doors are locked.,1
"I just recently stayed at the SLS Hotel for NYE 2015 and I went to the nightclub Life which is located inside the hotel to bring in the New Year the best way possible. The club was amazing and one of the best experiences I've ever had. Everyone that works at the SLS Hotel are all awesome people with great customer service! The night at the club i misplaced my clutch that had my iPhone 6, credit card, and ID.i was soooo panicked! The day after the club i used the find my iPhone app and it showed that my phone was still somewhere inside the SLS Hotel, in the vicinity of Life nightclub. So on a mission i went, straight to security to see if someone would allow me to look inside the club because nothing was turned in. The sweetest lady by the name of Dani Jackson, who is the head of security on the day shift walked us into the club as the employees were cleaning up, and low and behold we found my purse with my iPhone, credit card, and ID in it! I was on cloud nine, and if it wasn't for Dani who allowed us to go back into the club, my phone and belongings would of been a goner for good! So DANI JACKSON thank you SOOOOOOO much for all of your help and the help of the security day staff for helping me make this Vegas trip a very memorable one! I will definitely stay there again and refer all of my friends and family to this hotel as well! The SLS ROCKSSSS! Esp DANI JACKSON! ",2
"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been a patron of. If you give it any less than 5 5 stars then you hate things that America stands for! n nThe decor is awesome! The food is served out of an old airstream trailer named dutchess. It seems like everything around is collected from local thrifts. It's mainly retro and hodgepodge. There is a boxing ring you can step into and a store as well. They do different events on different nights to include swing dancing, boxing, old school workouts. n nThe food is spectacular! There is a wide range of sliders, salads and drinks. They have salads and shareable dishes to include Mac n cheese muffin bites and chicken pot pie in a mason jar. All the drinks are served out of mason jars as well. They have 16oz jars and 32oz jars if you're looking for a little more liquid courage. n nGive this place a shot! You won't be let down. They do group events and functions and can be reserved for just about anything. So cool!",2
"This concept is totally idiotic! n nAfter having a bad day, we decided to go with some familiar comfort food. n nUpon entering we knew that things were different and there was a nice young woman who was there to explain it all. I was willing to give this a try, but we found out immediately that it's no longer a buffet. n nI've never had to be given a tour with detailed instructions how to order at a restaurant before and still didn't understand. It was move like we had to trained on how to order. n nEach person gets a card with a magnetic stripe and you're expected to get it swiped at every station you go to. A swipe for your salad. A swipe for your soup. A swipe for your meat. Older people and families with lots of kids are really gonna hate this! n nThen you pay at some register that's either in the soup section or the salad section. I'm not sure which. By that point at was so annoyed and had stopped paying attention and we left. n nAdmittedly, this review is not about the food, but the complete confusion we felt immediately despite their friendly and patient staff. n nThis is horrible idea and I hope abandon this test concept soon!",1
"For having such great reviews, I was very unimpressed by this place. I'm not sure what they are going for here, possibly a fancy higher end drink and eatery thing. I was expecting a great beer selection, and on that front, they very much do have great craft beer. However, I've never seen anyone charge as much for beer as this place does. They jack the prices WAY up, so much so that even happy hour pricing doesn't really make it worth going. I ordered the happy hour tacos and they were good, but not amazing or anything. So if you have a lot of money to throw around for expensive beers and even more expensive food well then you can do so with a nice view from the balcony.",1
"It was beautifully.boring! I am a big fan of the beatles and cirque, but was sorely disappointed by the lack of acrobatics in this one. I can appreciate the high production value and it definitely has artistic merit.but i was really bored throughout and so was my sister. I'd rank my cirque experiences as 1. mystere 2. Ovo 3. Love 4. O. If you loved O, then you'll probably like Love too.",1
It's all suite with sunken living rooms. Could sleep 5 comfortably. Has everything you would need. One of the best looking lobbys. The Venetian and Palazzo pools are connected. Tons of restaurants and food court. Canyon Ranch Spa. And a great 24h Walgreens right in front. A big pro for me is that it couldn't be closer to the clubs at Wynn Encore which I enjoy. Real easy walk to Caesars and as far as Cosmo. Trust me spend the extra to stay here and you get it back in square footage. P.S. I've had a lot of success being friendly at the front de k for decent views.,2
Freezing waiting outside in line ugh,1
"Overpriced Horrible Housekeeping! n nI stayed in a suite for 5 nights, and continously had housekeeping issues that were reported and Not addressed. Housekeeping not coming until late in the afternoon, not vacuuming, leaving hair in the tub repeatedly, leaving standing water in the tub, hair in my sheets, re arranging my things, and USING MY TOLIET WITHOUT FLUSHING! nStaff offered a complimentary breakfast which I was unable to use, offered me free snacks and soda. All I wanted was adequate housekeeping service. If I hadn't prepaid I would have left on the 2nd day. I WAS NOT COMPED. After showing the Asst. Mgr. pictures I was told I would get free nights stay certificates bonus points. I had to call the Hilton customer service line TWICE and complete a survey before I heard back from the hotel, and after that I received 1 free regular room stay. nMotel 6 service at a Hilton price. Just stay somewhere else save yourself the frustration.",1
"I was on my way home and this was the last chance for milk tea before heading towards Mountains Edge. I already passed Chinatown and was too lazy to turn back. n nOrdered the milk green tea, worst milk green tea I've ever had! No green tea taste what so ever and so so sweet. YUCK! It was pre made and he basically just poured it out of a pitcher. Saw it for myself. I was so pissed at myself for picking this place.don't you hate when you do that!? I chucked the drink in the trash when I got home. Better off stopping at Starbucks for a grande latte for the price I paid for this disgusting milk green tea. n nAnyways. n nThat's what I get for being lazy and not driving back towards Chinatown for some REAL milk green tea. Oh well.lesson learned. n nYelp fail.",1
"Amazing breakfast. Old classic spot with menus in french. The potatoes were so good. They bring u coffees cafes as you sit down. Cool vibe great food. If your American and want breakfast just go with the ""deluxe "" you won't regret it.",2
I ordered the sizzling rice soup as a bowl and the server failed to tell us that if we got the combo meal it would come with soup. Then after we already ordered the soup I asked if we could cancel it and just get combos and the manager said no. Terrible customer service. I will never be back.,1
"Update from Last Review Customer Service at Valley Ho continues to astonish me. The staff is unable to own up to their shortcomings, and instead of correcting it, they blame the paying customer. n nI was planning on continuing to enjoy the bar and food from Valley Ho after having a bad night there, but after the arrogant responses from Jessie T, I plan on never coming back. n nSorry Valley Ho, we're breaking up. For good.",1
"Well, I stood at the bar for 15min with a menu in my hand wanting to order carry out but though the bartender came my way several times, once even completing a carry out order for a guy standing right next to me, I was never acknowledged. At one point, a woman who also wanted carry out who came in after me, went and sat at the bar was promptly greeted. This is where my patience ran out an I walked out. SUDDENLY, a guy who must have been a manager came out of the restaurant asking if I was there for carry out to which I responded ""I wanted to order but I'm over it now. "" He politely offered to take my order himself which I appreciated but he HAD to have seen me to know that I was leaving without being helped and after I'm halfway to the car is too late.",1
First let me say that thier chowder is pretty darn good but that is about it. Had the calimari and the shrimp scampi. Calimari was not near as good as in the past and the scampi was absolutely horrific.not worth a revisit!,1
"Good atmosphere, but food was average, and a bit . n nTry the Lobster Miso.",1
"The room was very nice, however the dynamics of this particular hotel building were off. You have to park in the garage and walk across the street to the casino. The security of the parking garage is sketchy. The cabana suites building is next to an abandoned hotel and they attempt to block the view with decals on the window. n nThe casino is a different story and lots of fun.",1
"If you are a rich bunny rabbit this is the place for you. I was not comfortable in this place. My problem, yes. Creamy tomato soup served cold Disappointed. Crackers like tree bark tasty but tough to chew. Sandwich of salad tasty but blah blah blah. We all should eat healthy. This place is expensive. I'm out. I'll make my creative salads at home and save 50.00.",1
Very tasty and yet light. I am not a dietician but for some reason I don't feel stuffed after a good breakfast in this restaurant.,2
"We had a call in order. We were told it would be ready I'm 15 mins. We arrived 20 mins later to be told that they were changing the oil for the wings and it would be 30 mins extra to complete our order. Are you kidding me!?!? If I wanted to wait at your restaurant for good I wouldn't have called it in. They deliver but only for orders over 100 and I told them I live 3 miles away and they need to deliver it to me for this complete in inconvenience . The ""manager ""said he would resolve this now and get our wings with their fresh oil. How can this happen? Oil takes a long time to heat. We then had to sit for another 12 minutes waiting on our order. To make matters worse, the wings are totally from the old oil and they didnt even give us a discount. The good may be good here normally, but this service will not be accepted. Never again!",1
Ive been here plenty of times. Service has always ben excellent! Food is usually good. This last visit my tacos came out cold. Sent them back and came out cold again. Server was very quick to fix the situation but did not seem to surprised by it. There was no manager to come over and apologize. Very disappointed in the resolution since there really wasn't one. My wife did not even eat her dish and the server didn't notice let alone offer to comp her meal as well. Lots of goofing around and major lack of customer service.,1
"Just to show that it isn't just me, as one DumbAss that sent me a message saying. This place was only open 3 months for a reason, charging way too much for Crap!",1
"Loved this place! I was recommended by a friend who said it was amazing, and I couldn't agree more. I got a brazilian done with the owner I forgot her name , and it was the least painful wax I've ever had. The wax was quick and not painful compared to other places I've been to . The location is very discreet, and it's small and cute. Everyone was very nice, which is always a plus.",2
"What a let down! I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. n nFirst and foremost, the service was some of the worst I have ever had. We waited for everything, whether it was from the bar, the kitchen, or the sushi bar. None of the waiters knew who ordered what or what was on the plate. None of them pointed out which oysters were which or which sushi was what. When asked about the timing of some things, they were snotty and unapologetic. n nWhatever we ate was mediocre. The only thing I enjoyed was the oysters, but we ate those so early in the evening that the only thing I left with was a bad taste in my mouth. n nDON'T GO HERE.",1
"On the outside which is inside the Cosmopolitan , it resembles that of a truck street vendor, but don't be fooled Here lies a 2 in 1 deal so unique. n nTo the right is the Mexican food, to the left is the Chinese food. Your choice, choose wisely. n nI decided to go with carb overload and steer towards the noodles. Dan Dan Mian they're called wheat noodles with spicy pork bits. It was incredible. When it arrived, my first thought was ""This is freakin' tiny "". I thought I could eat five of them! So yes, small portion.but wowww is it tasty. n nAlso went with the salt and air margarita, which my bartender creatively added a touch of hibiscus tequila to it. I give her props too, because she could give a Tequila lesson to anyone who could listen. The salt ""air "" was a cloud of ecstasy. Yum. n nSo yeah. a little expensive but unique dishes.",2
"So, I've been going to Pardise since it open, what, 7 yrs ago? They have one of the best managers they've ever had, now. Mason, is the best. He's always there when I come in and is the nicest and most helpful manager I've seen EVER. You can tell he's good as all the employere are nice, smiling and go out of their way to just be pleasant. It's the best feeling to go in here after a hard day at work, so nice! n n4 stars? that's Panera's fault. As they now own Paradise, no samples anmore. Health dept. my foot, that's just Panera being cheap. n nOtherwise, great work, guys you make it joy to come here!",2

Pleasantly surprised.with this little find! We went there to see a friend from out of town play for a fundraiser for a child who is ill. It's definitely something you'd find near the beach. 3 drafts.and full bar. Packed house.just North of the Vig UpTown. Definitely a casual dive and fun too!,2
"Yes, there are panoramic views of Edinburgh to be had on the third floor cafe, but if you plan to take a seat at one of the tables in either the glass enclosed espresso bar, or the cafe, do bring a bottle of disinfectant. You will need it to clean whichever dirty table you choose to sit at after you have cleared it of the dirty dishes from the previous diner, of course. Don't get me wrong. I love John Lewis. They get many things so right in their department store. I have always enjoyed gracious and attentive customer service in the shop, which is so lacking in so many other places in Edinburgh. I have been to the third floor cafe on more than a few occasions and I have never found it to be in a state of acceptable cleanliness. Nor have I ever had anything but indifferent customer service at best. Plain surly at worst. After my last visit when we, yet again, had to bus a table for ourselves and pull out a bottle of disinfectant to clean it off, I have sworn it off. I will still shop in John Lewis, but until they replace the worn out furnishings, get to grips with busing and cleaning tables in a timely fashion and move some better customer service into the cafe, I won't be popping in for refreshments. Oh, and a fresher selection of baked goods to accompany coffee would also be an improvement. Stale, tired and battered is just not acceptable. So, I would not hesitate to recommend John Lewis the department store, but don't bother with the cafe not even for the views.",1

"I've noticed that as my solidly senior parents get older their taste in food gets pickier. Due to this, every time I decide to treat them to a meal, I really have to put a ton of thought into it. I've struck out many times, but hit one out of the field with Phoenix City Grille. n nGoat cheese toasts started the show. The cheese was delicious, with the sun dried tomatoes really giving some depth n nEntrees ordered were the pot roast, pasta and an amazing porkchop special. The pot roast was exactly what I craved, dare I say needed. It took all the self control I could muster to save some for leftovers Pot roast sandwich the next day, of course . The chop was devoured in a frenzy by my normally mellow dad, while my mom eagerly sopped up the pasta sauce. n nI still tend to over think meal planning with the family, thankfully Phoenix City Grille has given me a solid option.",2
"Pure Fitness Arrowhead has literally changed my life. I joined in January of this year. I was 286 pounds, and had never had any success sticking with a diet or exercise regimen for any amount of time. That has all changed! nThe first great help on my road to success was the two free beginning consultations, where I learned how to use the different machines and how to work out. Then, the gym's owner Jose personally helped me set up a meal plan. nNext, I decided to join the Fitness Challenge which started in the middle of January. That was where I really took off. The challenge lasted two months, over which I managed to lose 50 pounds! I received help not just from my trainer, but from all the trainers. It was amazing. I ended up winning the challenge, which was one of the happiest days of my life! nPure Fitness Arrowhead offers tons of classes, many of which I take. My favorites are the PurePT training sessions, Saturday Seminars, and the monthly boot camps. nThe thing that keeps me coming in to Pure Fitness Arrowhead is the people, however. Jose knows my name and checks in on my progress. Robert never misses an opportunity to say hello. My trainer Isaac pushes me harder than I've ever been able to do alone. Cameron pulls out all of the stops when he teaches his classes. EVERYONE who is employed there is friendly and approachable. I've been to other gyms and floundered on my own, been ignored by the staff, and have been charged way too much. nFast forward to today, where I have currently lost 92 pounds. I know that I will reach my goals, and they'll be there to keep me on the right track. I would and have recommended this club to everyone most of my family has joined since I started . You can't go wrong here!",2

"Have been coming to Golden Canyon for at least 20 years. The food has always been exceptional but the service has been poor at best. Ate there again this week and the food was excellent. HOWEVER, the service was terrible! There were only 6 people eating in the restaurant but the service was very slow, the waitress disappeared after delivering our meal, and never checked to see if everything was correct or if we were happy. My husband gave explicit instructions about having his appetizers with his meal but she delivered it with my appetizers. n nThe staff were sitting around talking rather than checking on the customers and carrying on like it was a gab session. Very poor staff training. n nMy husband and I are giving it some thought as to wether or not want to return. n nWent there to give it one more try. Service was better than before but still mediocre at best. The Orange Chicken had very little sauce and couldn't be eaten over rice because it was so dry. Chicken was way overlooked. Had to ask several times for our wine water. Hubby's Lemon Chicken had very little sauce also and was dry. Probably last time there. After all these years the place has gone downhill.",1
"This was our third visit. I highly recommend the place. Yes, it is situated next to a gun shop in a very off strip location, but once you are in the door, you are captivated by the retro vibe, the good Italian food and the live music. We have always enjoyed our meals here. Worth a visit. Half price wine bottles on Sunday and Monday are a bonus.",2
I have only great things to say about 4 Seasons Cat Hospital. I have 3 Norwegian Forest Cats and my old 17 year old cat was diagnosed with CRF and heart disease last May. My old vet did very well with our dogs but seemed not to care much for cats and they were treated very roughly. nI interviewed a number of vets in Charlotte and found Dr. Moses at 4 Seasons and it is the most wonderful place for cats. My old Nellie who was so scared the first time I took her now jumps on the scales and peacefully waits for Dr. Moses. The lab techs are so gentle and sweet to all our cats but Nellie needs this so much now as she enters the end of her sweet life with us. Dr. Moses will even come to our house to help her cross the rainbow bridge when the time comes. nI would highly recommend them. nTheckla Sterrett,2
"Not a bad place for Happy Hour 3 6 pm , you can get their flatbreads for half off. nService was friendly and efficient. n nMy only wish is that that food selection for happy hour would be a bit larger. n nI know Maggiano's is known for gigantic family style portions similar in style to Bucca di Beppo. I was pleasantly surprised however to find a miniature tiramisu on their menu which was very tasty and not too rich.",2
"We headed here for dinner the other night because we had a restaurant.com gift certificate. For the food and service, it deserves 1 star. But since the space itself is nice and the happy hour deals are good, I'll bump it to 2 stars. n nWhen we arrived, there was exactly one host bartender server and he may have even been doing some cooking too. So needless to say, service was incredibly slow despite there only being two other tables of people . And to make it worse, he reminded me of a used car salesman extremely pushy about getting you to order certain dishes. The table next to us was a mom and young daughter. The mom declined dessert, but the server then proceeded to tell the little girl about the bananas foster crepes and that she must want those. It was all very uncomfortable. And the same thing happened to us with the one special of the day that he described to us. n nThe good thing here is the happy hour deals. When we went, all mojitos were 1 2 half and all seafood and meat tapas were 1 2 off. And that is a great deal. Unfortunately, the mojitos and tapas were downright awful. n nWe had a mango mojito and blood orange mojito. Neither of us could even stand to drink them. They were very obviously made with a powder mix and you could see and taste the powder. Ick, icky, ick. n nWe ordered a a variety of tapas the special of the day red peppers with capers and feta , mac 'n' cheese with bacon, tortilla a la espanola, fried dates, etc. We were both incredibly hungry, but we didn't finish any of the dishes. Not only were they disappointing, they were just plain bad. n nThe mac 'n' cheese was dried out, had little to no flavor, and practically no bacon. The tortilla espanola was very dried out and way overcooked. These are two tapas that are standard favs of mine at any tapas place, but complete failures here. n nWe literally left the food half eaten on the table and went to another restaurant in the same shopping center.",1
"I really enjoyed my brunch! We were in a decent size group with a small baby and they were great about accommodating us! Since it's a buffet it seems that table turnover is slower than a normal restaurant, but they were great about putting tables together and making it work. n nAs for reviews that mentioned food not being served hot, I did not experience that at all. Everything that should have been in chaffing dishes was, and the staff was great about keeping all the food stocked. The buffet line can be long at times, but it really just depends on when you go up. The made to order omelette was a great option, though no one at my table ordered one. n nOverall great experience, and would be five stars if only North Carolina could serve alcohol before noon!",2
"First off, I've cancelled my reservation with them out of frustration from their lies. I booked a room through their website because of their ""Best Rate Guarantee "" promise. Having gone through all the hoops they make you jump through to beat the competitor pricing by 20 , I've found that their promise is a load of crap. Despite me sending the requested evidence, apparently the time stamp on the bottom of the page when you print from a website is not a legitimate time stamp because ""it shows when you printed it, not when the deal was active "" on the competitor site. This is so BS! How else am I supposed to show a time stamp?! How else can I print out a deal from a website unless that deal was currently active!? n nWorst customer experience ever!",1
All I have to say is no. You should just cook at home because at Toby's you will practically serve your self!,1

Teri's ROTD for this place made me want to go and try some of the yummy dishes she had mentioned. I tried nSzechuan eggplant and noodles YUM AND YUM nPork dumplings in chilli sauce pretty good nvegetable pancake kind of dry but ok nD had the Szechuan chicken which was probably the least tasty dish here we asked them to limit the sugar in this dish so that may have caused the taste to be different n nThey also brought us a small bowl filled with fried flat noodles and a dipping sauce on the side after we had ordered. The place looked super clean. n nOverall pretty good! I would give the place 3.5 stars but rounding it off to 4.,2
"We stayed at this hotel for my cousin's bachelorette weekend and it was the best place to stay. The resort grounds was amazing and there was a lot of stuff to do. We had a spa day at the resort and the amenities at the spa were amazing. The mineral pool was so relaxing and we all either had a facial or a massage and we were all pleased with the service. We also did the arizona wine experience and we had such a great time learning about the different types of wines and it was a pleasure meeting Jonas. He recommended The House Brassiere restaurant in downtown Scottsdale and it was so great. He also recommend the Alto restaurant at the hotel and we had a pleasant experience. He was very good and made sure we had all our needs met. Kyle, the bartender at the Grotto was great. He kept the drinks flowing and he was a pleasure. We definitely will come back again! We cannot thank enough the staff for the great service!",2
"A friend told us about this place and I was very excited to try this Korean and Hawaiian fusion restaurant. They had a range of dishes from loco moco to bibimbap. We ordered the cold Korean noodle and their mixed BBQ platter which consists of the short ribs, meat jun and chicken breast. You can tell they take pride in their BBQ as each piece was grilled to perfection. I really enjoyed the meat jun Seasoned ribeye dipped in egg before pan frying especially with their dipping sauce. The banchan free refill that came before the meal was also delicious, well seasoned bean sprouts, kim chee and radish. The owner server was very nice to us and even gave my wife an extra cup of their specialty Korean tea to go. We also had some fresh peanuts that just finished boiling in Hawaiian sea salt. All this for 20, not a bad deal at all. We will definitely be coming back to try out more of their menu items. n ",2
"Tech support has long been known as the business for the socially inept who enjoy condescension and overcompensating. Problem is, most of us need tech support. Minor problems may be fixable by jiggling a wire or playing with Microsoft settings, but when something significant fails, the service of teckies is required. n nI went into Simple Computer Repair with several problems a computer hard drive failure that required a data back up, installation of a wireless card and installation of a new hard drive. Let me start by saying that their work on installing hardware and backing up data was excellent and problem free. And their pricing for the work seemed really cheap compared to Best Buy Geek Squad. n nSo why the two stars? Well, their customer service was horrendous. The woman working seemed irritated that I was there and didn't want to listen to what was going on with the computer. Then, when things started to go wrong with the installation, the customer service managed to get worse. n nWhen I picked up the computer and turned it on, the computer recognized that a wireless card existed, but the computer couldn't connect to the wireless network. When I called the shop to explain the installation wasn't working, they didn't want to help diagnose the problem, they only wanted me to bring the computer back. So I did. They tinkered with the software and claimed it was working. When I returned home after the problem was ""fixed, "" the computer still couldn't connect to the wireless. n nWhen I called back, I tried to talk through the issue with the woman working there in case it was just something I didn't understand so that I didn't have to go back in to the store. She didn't want to hear about it and just repeated that I should come in. I pushed and finally got to speak with the owner or manager of the shop. He was actually willing to come out to the house and solve the problem. He was so nice that I wanted to give the place 5 stars, but he didn't actually solve the problem. I still couldn't connect to wireless and had to bring in Geek Squad to configure the wireless software with the wireless router. n nBottom line the place is great for installing hardware, but if you want something fixed that involves specific software being compatible with hardware so that the computer just turns on and works when you get home , it's not the place to go. Two stars for the good work, minus three for the bad experience.",1

"My normal stylist switched salons and works a bit farther away so I came here based on the recommendation of one of my friends. I'm glad I did! n nI got a hair cut from Rachel today and everything went great. She did a wonderful job chopping off inches of damaged hair and even gave some helpful recommendations on a style. She never tried to push any products and was very easy to talk to. Even though the place was packed, she took her time to make sure I was happy about my haircut. She styled it nicely even though I just had boring errands to run afterwards. I felt fabulous toting my bottled water around Costco, walking around Fry's with my sunblock, and sipping a mocha cookie crumble frapp at Starbucks with my pinky up.

This used to be my go to spot. But today it was terrible. The rice in the loco moco was definitely old and taste rotten. I couldn't even eat it. Had to spit it out.

"Let's see it took 15 minutes just to get a cocktail menu. I don't believe we got our dinner menus for about 25 30 minutes after we asked for them. I asked the water guy if this is normal and he said ""I work at another fine dining establishment, yes we do it there. "" I've been to most of the upper end restaurants throughout the strip and never had to wait like that. Having said that Giada's is hardly ""fine dining "". Our table was in the bar area. We ordered our appetizers and thought they were ok, but nothing really to write home about. Once dinner arrived, they brought not only 1 wrong order, but 2. The waiter put it in the system incorrectly. They ended up comping both. n nThe saving grace was the dessert cart. n nPutting service aside because every now and then a restaurant will fail on service for a very similar price and views Bellagio fountains , the food at Scarpetta blows Giada's out of the water. n nI did voice my concerns to the manager via email only to receive a canned email.",1
"Wowzers I will knowingly never eat food from here again. n nI placed an order via Grubhub and awaited for the food to arrive. We were beyond starved and the moment it arrived it was time to dig in. n nI started with the salad, which was presented well and crisp. After removing a layer we ate and continued our studies. Time for more salad anyone? n nIt certainly was.until I looked down and noticed a dead FLY in the mix. Ewww, how disgusting! n nI don't remember ordering extra insects in my salad. It certainly had me wondering that if their quality control for food preparation was this horrid, which other insects could we have consumed in our bug salad. n nWe were rather grossed out by the ordeal we did not eat the pasta we ordered from them. n nI called the restaurant the next day, and they mentioned a manager would call me in a few minutes, after confirming my address and phone number. No call or acknowledgement of the problem from management. No thanks, I am unable to respect a business who operates without responsibility for their mistake and or ""mixup "". n nIf you order food from them, be careful. You might receive extra bits you did not ask for. n nI hope this is helpful for someone, I wouldn't want you to have the same experience.",1
"I wished I had better things to say. I was so excited when Dragon I opened on State St, having a range of fusion food and serving bubble teas too! Unable to contain my excitement I organized a mini dinner session with 2 other friends. n nThe first signs that something was weird was that our waitress did not take down any of our orders she merely 'remembered' them. We decided to start with the korean spicy rice cakes. But we waited forever and our appetizer did not come. One by one the main course was served, and by the time we were all done, there was still no sign of our appetizer! n nI wish I could say that the appetizer was the only eventful thing that happened. But one of my friends ordered the korean spicy tofu soup she's vegetarian . What they served her was korean spicy soup with beef. And so she spent half the time picking out the pieces of beef from the soup. Another of my friend had the Vietnamese stir fry noodles, which took more than 25 min and we had to remind the waitress, otherwise we would go hungry. They did give us a complimentary fried rice, which we did not order. My guess is that the waitress probably 'thought' we ordered it, so the kitchen made it and decided to give it to us for free. By that point we were too fed up to even ask about our missing appetizer. n nEver since that experience I haven't gone back for another shot. After sufficient time has passed for the memory to fade I might go return to give them a second chance. But right now I can't bring myself to say positive stuff about this place.",1
"Living in Las Vegas for 29 years, I was excited to try this bar tavern. My first impression was good beautiful interior, with flat screen tvs adorning the walls, and comfortable furniture. but this impression quickly changed as we were ""greeted "" by the waiter server with no smile and rude attitude when he finally took our order. Our party was quite large since we were celebrating a birthday in our group. The servers continued to act rude by the faces they made and made us feel that we were in the way of their serving line through their comments. Even though I had the urge to leave, we decided to order food and see what all the hype was about. I ordered the prime rib sliders with onion rings, and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips. We weren't impressed. My sliders were dry and his fish was overcooked. In the middle of dinner and drinking, one of our guests informed us that he was waiting outside because the ""bouncers "" wouldn't let him in since the bar was packed. WHAT? My sister proceeds to go outside to at least greet our guest along with her boyfriend, and guess what? ALL three of them could not come back in. By this time we were there for about 2 hrs which was 2 hrs too long. We decided to get everyone to leave this establishment and go to a more friendly, professional, and accommodating bar restaurant who will be in business longer than this bar will be. Never again, BAR, never again.",1
"You know, I used to really like this place. My previous review was 4 stars. They had a couple of good subs, but that quality has hit the fan in the past year. nI've made two to go orders recently and they were BOTH messed up. Each time, I ordered a salad w my sub and didn't receive it. The first time, I was reallllly craving a salad and they forgot it it was late and I was hungry, so I actually went back to Santisi's to get my food a 40 minute round trip from my neck of the woods. This second time, hungry and fed up, I was not willing to drive back to Santisi's to have them fix their mistake. So, I called to speak to a manager. nJohnny, the manager, told me that he would issue a gift certificate. I explained that this was the last time I'm going there it's a far drive and this is the second time they've messed up a simple order. The subs aren't even what they used to be. Unless you LIKE soggy bread under your meatballs, of course. I just wanted the cost of my sandwich refunded the salad comes w the sandwich to the card I used. Either ignoring my point or just not caring, he told me that I would have to drive to Santisi's to get a refund, because they needed to swipe my card and could not take the numbers over the phone. Baloney, anyone? Johnny just kept repeating policy until I got more and more frustrated with the fact that, again, it's MY responsibility to incur gas costs and take ANOTHER 40 minute drive so they could fix a mistake THEY made for a SECOND TIME! Finally, Johnny put me on hold while I was mid sentence. Really?!?! I am apalled and piiiiiissed! nI thought this situation was deplorable and maybe an owner would care to hear about their dysfunctional kitchen and worse management. WRONG! I called to ask for the GM name, was not given a name, and put on hold for over four minutes. Finally, Toni Santisi and I speak and not only does she deny Johnny put me on hold mid sentence the customer is always right, right?! but she barely lets me get out a complete sentence and talks over me the whole time to end by insulting me. She said she cannnot issue a partial refund, but she can void the entire transaction in order to have my husband and I never set foot in her dirty bar again. I'm sure she won't issue a refund because surprise! they never took our name when we ordered on the phone. Way to run your business. Besides, that was decided when I came home and you screwed my order up for the SECOND TIME IN A ROW. nNow, don't get me wrong, I will go out of my way for exceptional food I'm talking to you, Capriotti's sub shop on Mill , but I will NOT go out of my way to have so so food from a place run by monkeys.",1
"We've started coming to this place every weekend. With high quality organic ingredients and low prices, you can't beat it. Their food network specials are not the best items on the menu.

"In reviewing the food, just the food, I'd give it all 5 stars. I've been here twice and both times everything my party ordered was great.

"I'm so glad I live so close to this delicious coffee shop that I can go with friends to talk and enjoy an AMAZING cup of Nutella latte. I'm a huge fan of Nutella and when I heard they had Nutella latte here, I'm went bizarre and drove here the minute after and it was delicious! I love the live music they have in here, the bar where you can plug in your laptop, and the upstairs area with all the books and small tables. The vibe is so good, not too loud and great music. Even though the prices are a little high, it's worth it. But I do not recommend the pastries, those are way too expensive I think and I can get those in other places with the same taste and lower price.",2
"I went there to get my phone screen replaced, at first they said it would be 80 to fix it. So then i ordered my screen from online so it would be cheaper for them to fix it.

"The Herb Box has always had a great, varied menu, which includes vegetarian, gluten free and request gluten free options. The desserts are wonderful. What I had previously found lacking was the service. After an absence of a few months, I am pleased to report, that the service at the Herb Box has improved dramatically with the addition of Vera. She deftly and attentively handled our party of nine on Wednesday, Sept. 17. We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. In addition to the usual tasks of serving and refilling water glasses, etc., Vera made knowledgeable recommendations about entrees and other menu items, along with wine suggestions. Looking forward to going back and requesting a table in Vera's section.",2
They don't even deserve this star sadly. This is the worst location I've been to. They are always very slow and they make far too many mistakes on simple orders. There have been multiple incidences where they didn't even bother to mix the flavor into the slush just leaving bare crushed ice and syrup splotches. The worst! Never coming to this location again.,1
"I usually have good visits to this location but I guess going through the drive thru today was a bad choice. The person working the drive thru was cranky when I ordered and I was worried she didn't get the second drink I ordered because she talked over me to go to the window. Not sure if it was because I drove away and said out loud to my mom in the car that I wasn't too sure she got the second drink, but we got to the window and she told us the total and gave me the change without a receipt. She handed me the first drink which was a iced black tea with vanilla that I handed to my mom and the barista girl kind of stalled and waited before even handing a straw and the second drink. But it wasn't until I drove to the other side of town that my mom tasted her drink and they had added flan syrup and vanilla syrup to her tea. It was like half her drink was syrup. It's just extremely suspicious that I got no receipt and the awkward standing and stalling makes me think it was purposely done. Definitely avoiding going there.",1

Wow I walked into this place over the weekend not really knowing what to expect. n nI am so glad I walked in the place is great. n nThe decorations are amazing you really feel like you are in a pub. They even have a table that has a tap so you can sit there and serve your own drinks its pretty neat if you have a crowd who loves beer. Their food was amazing I had a burger that was cooked perfectly and tasted so good! Their selection of beer was amazing they have everything you could imagine. The service was so great I tipped double what I normally would tip. They have a great happy hour Mon through Fri till 7pm 2 for 1 drinks. If you want to have a good time try Steiner s they are AWESOME! n nUpdate I have went back twice since this review and the food was not as good. So I will not be back again since I feel as though I would waste my money.,1
"Well, I can only comment on the service. My husband and I have been wanting to try this out ever since it opened. We finally decided to go tonight a Tuesday night. When we walked in, there was a sign instructing us to seat ourselves. There were plenty of open tables, so we chose one. We sat, and sat. 10 minutes later, no one had welcomed us, or said 'be right there' in fact, no one acknowledged our existence. So we left and had dinner elsewhere. Like I said, this was a Tuesday night and there were plenty of open tables it's not like they were busy.",1
"Had the salmon BLT, which was tasty but pretty small for the price. Went with peanut butter pie for dessert. Not a huge fan of it, I make better pb pie. Overall the bill, with tip, was 25 ",1
"Reposting this to make sure Iit sticks n nDO NOT GO, AVOID THIS PLACE n nHad the 9.99 Steak and lobster nWasn't given option on potatoe, no option wether 'fresh' vegetables or salad nThe Vegetables where obviously frozen nThe lobster was way over cooked and steak was over 1 2 gristle. n nNASTY FOOD, POOR SERVICE, BAD NEIGHBORHOOD",1
"So much sugar added in the smoothies. Ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and they smothered it with buffalo sauce until it wasn't even edible. Returned it for a spinach salad which they pile up with greasy bacon. I think they are trying to be healthy but are seriously missing the mark. Service was terrible, the girl at the front looked and acted like she hated working there.",1
"This place is a waste of time. You wait in line for over an hour. Granted I understand their method of a conventional style bakery. But to that fact maybe you should include on your website, the fact not all of your desserts are ""served daily "". Very disappointed and feel that they should fix situations like this instead of the usual ""sorry "" and smile.",1
"I decided to eat at Tsunami because a group of my friends were going and I really had two choices suck it up or stay at home. I ordered an array of sushi because I was starving and quite a few rolls sounded pretty good. Boy was I wrong. Out of about six rolls, the bagel roll was the only one that I actually enjoyed. This is only because it was smothered in eel sauce which I could probably eat with a spoon, its so delicious. Each roll was either too saucy or the fish did not taste fresh. The service was also pretty crappy and the crowd was lacking, that's being nice. I would not recommend to someone I consider a friend.",1
"I had the linguine alla sorrentina. Delicious! When you get upstairs it feels like you're walking for forever to get to your table. But once you're there, it's a beautiful view of the Grand Canal below. Be prepared to hear the great and not so good gondoliers as they row by. Being closer to the ceiling you're closer to the sound bouncing off the ceiling. But the food was delicious! If you order ravioli, be prepared to only receive 6.",2
"I'll just repeat what everyone else says. what the hell are all those stairs about?!?! My girl almost took a header trying to get to the Boombox room, and she hadn't even been drinking! Damn new shoes and effing STAIRS. nRegardless, Marquee is still an absolute dream.probably an exact replica of what I had always thought a Vegas club would be. Opulent, crowded and people everywhere you turn. you're going to be claustraphobic, let's face it. Grab a drink and get over it. The screen in the main room will have you so mesmorized that you won't even notice the people around you until you inevitably have spilled drank all up in your heels. True story. Once you feel like you're about to have a seizure from the strobing lights, take a trip to the Boombox room, where you can get your thug life on, as I did. Never made it into the Library, but I suppose that just gives me a reason to go back, right? And considering how much fun I had and how I never stopped dancing, even when I was walking, I don't think I need a ""reason "" to go back. it's happening.",2
"Soo we stopped here for Sunday brunch. I hadn't heard anythinga bout the buffet at Mandalay Bay but we figured we'd give it a shot. My friend just made it clear to me that we HAD to have crab legs before leaving the lovely city. So we stopped in around 9 45am on a Sunday and pigged out! We had mimosas, eggs and bacon, and plenty of crab legs! I then continued to stuff myself with shrimp cocktail, a lilttle bit of prime rib, and other miscellaneous deliciousness! It was 23.95 for Sunday brunch. n nBy the time I got to the dessert part of the meal I was stuffed. I looked around anyway, but nothing really caught my eye. Not sure if it was because I was overly full or if it just wasn't as appealing as the rest of the stuff! It was good. And at a pretty reasonable price too!",2
"I am new to the area and heard this was a pretty good place to go. So I figured I would head there and watch some football and have some lunch. The pictures of the food look delicious and it seems they have some recognition with being the official pizza restaurant of the Cardinals and Diamondbacks. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. The TV's were all connected to a non HD Directv receiver. Is it that difficult to pay the extra 10 per month per receiver to have high definition? When I walked in the sign said please seat yourself which I hate because it typically means poor service. I gave them a chance. I sat down for over 15 minutes and not once did anyone come greet me or ask me if I had been waited on yet. Meanwhile three sets of people had come in after me and were already waited on and served their drinks. I definitely will not give this place the time of day again and I'm glad they are not an ""official "" anything for the Coyotes.",1
"I cannot pass up the opportunity to take the FTR First To Review on Chef Aaron May's latest creation. n nI stopped by for a drink during their grand opening celebration last night. While I arrived too late to sample the food, those around me said it was fabulous. n nThe place was packed but I think that is just because it was the grand opening. Located right on Main Street in Old Town, I can see this place being a perfect spot to grab a drink or a light bite after work, or as a more laid back place to go with a small group of people on a weekend night. Aaron did a fabulous job with the decor. I will return soon and update my review then. but I encourage anyone seeking a new hot spot in Old Town to go check out Mabel's On Main!",2
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. I live in a second story apartment building and have had many packages delivered by On Trac, EVERY single time, they have THROWN my packages up onto my balcony the only way to get to my balcony unless you're inside my apartment . I have contacted the company at least 3 times on the phone and at least 2 times in writing, and each time I'm told the ""manager "" of the driver will talk to them. Well apparently the driver truly only cares about a pay check. I come from the generation you EARN your money,well not this company, they just get paid to drive around and THROW people's things around that THE CUSTOMERS pay good money for! WORST delivery company EVER! n nI will definitely be seeking other methods of shipping.",1
"The poke as an ""appetizer "" is very filling. You can actually have this as your meal for only 9.95. As for the lunch special deals for about 10 is also very filling. It's really ""Big Island "" style portions where you can share one meal with two people. My boyfriend and I tasted the chicken katsu loco moco and the short ribs. These two choices are superb. n nI'd definitely would come back to this place when I head back to Las Vegas again. This is the spot to go to if you're missing the island flavors and you want to eat someplace away from the strip.",2
"Great broth ! Not many pho places can nail a savoury broth, but this place can! I've been to a couple pho restaurants in San Jose, ca and this place is comparable in flavour. A regular size bowl is hefty enough to fill your craving I'm about 225 lbs . Definitely worth returning! n n nAlso zero wait time. Just walk right in, sit down, and order!",2
"I loved the service and follow up. Great time for my guest. Everybody enjoyed themselves. One of the best idea I have ever had. The quality of the photos is excellent, the contract process is effortless and, most of all, it is so much fun!",2
"Delicious, large portions and friendly service. Always my favorite place for lunch and dinner, plus they sometimes have great specials on bowls! If you've never had sushi before, if you love it, or even tolerate it as a food option, hit up this place!",2
"I feel weird giving this place such a low review considering how many good reviews this place has received. Maybe I'm just a bit pickier than most, or it could be that there was only one item on the menu I could eat and it turned out to be a greasy mess. Unfortunately it wasn't pho either since all of their pho is beef or chicken based. n nIt was probably my mistake for expecting to find vegetarian pho, which I've had in all the pho restaurants I've been in from Texas to California. I guess Nevada is the exception, despite the wide variety of vegetarian cuisine in Vietnam thanks to a large Buddhist population. n nMy review is probably only useful for those who are vegan vegetarian. For all others you can probably safely ignore anything I have to say about the food here.",1
"My husband and I are visiting from San Diego. We saw over easy on our fav food show. We are both in the service industry and feel that great service is just as important as great food. You work hard for the money your bringing in to spend but some how for some reason it seems over easy does not have service standards. We are bummed because the food is great but bad service leaves bad taste. We got our food to go I called in for to go. The girl that answered was nice. My husband went to pick up. The hostess did say hi and welcome. She directed him to the bar to pick up our food there was a woman working behind the bar as he was walking up she looked at him grabbed a pitcher of water and began to walk around the restaurant ignoring him. after a couple minutes she walks up in knowledge is that he's there to pick up all of a sudden another man came out from the back and just handed him our food No, thank you no, is there anything else just our bill we felt they didn't want us there. he paid no words came out from the person who took his check. when we got back to our hotel about 15 minutes away we start to open up our food and realize they left out the maple syrup that they pride themselves and making it just felt like over easy didn't care we ordered the chicken fried steak the Wolfpack in the waffle sausages that were on the Food Network show we were just surprised at the lack of care that went into our to go order I think we will avoid this location and try a new one since you like the food! too bad",1
"First things first. Music. The musician will cuss. ALOT. And the music is very loud and very explicit so therefor bringing kids is a huge NO. I suggest that after 10 00 they can allow artists with explicit music. Also, you should add a list of the musicians and DJs saying what genre and if it is explicit. n nFood. The trucks were pretty incredible. I do think you should get more weather appropriate food. The soup truck was not a large hit considering it was 105 degrees outside. Another ice cream truck or cold non alcoholic drinks like tea or red bull. n n Other than that, I found all of it pretty good. nThank you.",1
"I used to frequent this location when it was Gold Bar. nI literally lived right behind the Gold Bar for a few years and the old location of the lucky dragon ' but that is another story. . I used to hang out there all times of day. n nIt seemed more ""authentic "" back then, or maybe I am getting old and reminiscing too much. It is not bad now, but it doesn't feel great either. n nEdit I have been using the drive thru more often now and DAMN they have good coffee!",2
"Like most Einstein locations, I'm unimpressed with the way the business is run. The bagels aren't bad, but they're not worth the aggravation it takes to obtain one. The line was crazy long on a Wednesday morning at 8 30am, there already was a severe shortage in options because several bagels and pastries were already sold out, and after ordering you continue to wait in line just to pay. n nThere are some pluses. This location has plenty of seating however, most of it is outside on a shared patio with Starbucks and a sandwich shop . It's a short walk from the Camelback automile, which makes it one of the best places to grab something to eat if you're getting your car serviced around breakfast or lunchtime. It's also open until 5pm which is actually pretty late for an Einstein. n nJudging by the fact that I've reviewed three Einstein locations, and given all of them just two stars, I'm guess that most of the problems come down from the corporate level. However, each location seems to always have a steady flow of customers, so why should they work to improve the massive flaws?",1
Always a Pittsburgh staple when I make it back. Southside is a good alternative to the Strip District. I spent a lot of the late 80's and 90's elbowing to get a sandwich late night there. So a little crowd on the Southside is nothing. Pastrami was a little tough today. But the taste was on point. Staff were on it. My staple is cap egg n cheese. I'll be back before I head back west.,2
"HAPPY HOUR IS THE TITS. I am new to Vegas as a resident, but not as a visitor. So when i asked my friend where is good happy hour at close to where I was driving, he said Ra Sushi at the Fashion Mall. He hit the nail on the head. Drink n food specials are amazing, and taste great. Also the wait staff is friendly as well. The price is great, me and the wifey were able to sit relax and enjoy a few drink's and have dinner in the outdoor seating area. There is also no lack in service, and quality of the food, even for happy hour specials.",2
"Only giving 1 star because my pedi was decent. The absolute worst gel mani I have ever received. 1 no manicure at all 2 didn't buff my nails so imagine how that looks with polish now 3 gel brush was hard! And still used it 4 gel was DRIED out and still used it. I even said, ""do you need a new brush? "" and she ignored me. The gel off one nail has come off after only 1 WEEK. Cuticle is a mess and gel polish is chipped on several nails. there is nothing worse than a disappointing day at the salon. Especially in Vegas.",1
"ULTRA EXPENSIVE! THE CHEAP STUFF STARTS AT SEVEN DOLLARS A DRINK! Get drunk before entering and smuggle in your alcohol! I just moved here from Connecticut and go to NYC clubs regularly. I pay 7.00 a drink there and up, but never have I paid 7.00 for a shot! SEVEN DOLLARS! HOLY CRAP! It was Paul Oakenfold spinning that night and the tour was sponsored by Jagermeister. Guess what I had for a shot? Jagermeister, so you would think there would be a special going. Nope! I guess all six of the snooty Jagermeister girls with the silicon lips need to get paid for the absolute nothing they do! n nOh, the club was plain and unimaginative. The visuals were standard, but unimaginative as well. My bro is a VJ so I am familiar. The sound was solid if not a bit like that Pioneer picture with the guy in the chair with his hair being blown back. Bring ear plugs. Tons of weed being smoked inside and tons of cigarette smokers outside like being in Europe. Obviously, you smoke because you cannot afford the drinks. n nOnly for the well paid.",1
"I love this location of Takamatsu. n nI frequented this location A LOT when I used to live in PHX. n nAs far as Korean restaurants go we all know that they aren't known for their remarkable service. This location of Takamatsu is the exception. n nKorean food here is really tasty for PHX standards, but the reason why my boyfriend and I kept coming back here aside from location was because of the service. n nEvery time we came here, the servers were very attentive and SUPER friendly. Even if they were deep in the weeds, they still managed to remain alert to our table or at least apologize if they forgot something which rarely happens at Korean restaurants . n nThey are far from cheap when it comes to their ban chan side dishes . n nThe servers here work really hard, and I know you would have a great dining experience if you decide to check this place out.",2
"4 stars for location and maybe 3 for food. Drink specials weren't amazing but not bad either. The location is what makes this place right outside Monti's in a great patio. n nWe went before a concert and had a few drinks and some apps. The positives of the food were that you could get 5 tapas but they were pretty simple. Our favorite was the braised beef and chirizo on the sweet potato chip. It was filling and tasty. The taco had braised beef but wasn't my favorite. It was really messy and just didn't taste as good. We also had the chicken lollipops which were different than i thought they would be they were grilled chicken with franks red hot on top. Now don't get me wrong, that combo can't do anyone wrong, but for a restaurant bar with that kind of rep, you would think they were the bone in wings, frenched and then presented differently. Call me whatever you want for that comment just saying. n nAnyway, we will be back here anytime we are around since we did have fun, we had great service and it is a great patio. For the money, the food wasn't the worst but i would rather go somewhere else, even if it was a bit more money.",2
"Man, was I expecting much more. n nFirst the good even with peanuts EVERYWHERE the place felt pretty clean and inviting. A shoot sends peanuts to the tables with possibly unnecessary force which makes them explode a bit when they reach your table.which I guess is pretty fun the first time around. n nNow the rest We got the Barrie Burger and the Mad Sconie Burger. The Barrie has peanut butter, bacon and cheese. I bit into it and immediately put it down and opened it to make sure it actually had peanut butter in it. Yup. It did. Weird. Nothing really stood out in terms of flavors. Pretty much tasted like a cheeseburger. The Mad Sconie burger which comes with fried pickles, bacon, better beef burger and spicy cheese bun was also tasteless and ""uninspired "". This is the award winning burger, so either this was an off night or someone hasn't tasted Old Fashioned Burgers. n nFinally our waitress was not very friendly. Kept on having conversations with other people while we were clearly waiting for the check for a while and trying to flag her down. Oh well.",1
"While the units are beautiful luxury living, during my visit as a potential buyer investor when they were first being marketed, as a sensitive, I was overcome by feelings from spirits who appeared to have passed away in this building. Now, that the units have all been sold, I hope those spirits have crossed over.",2
"Okay, now, I have officially attended all the Cirque Du Soleil shows in Las Vegas. I have to admit that Ka, Beatle's ""Love "", and Mystere are all in the bottom of the deck. n nI would rank ""O "" and ""Le Reve "" non Cirque at the very top. n nIf you are looking to shell out 100 per ticket, get bored, and find a way to fall asleep at a show, KA delivers! n nIt is the only Cirque Du Soleil that tries to tell a story. The story is easy to understand however, the acrobatics, musical score, and sword play were poorly designed and delivered. I found myself wondering when this show would end! I can not tell you how many times I looked at my watch. And, as I surveyed the audience around me, many were either sleeping or doing the same as me. n nThere were only three cool things from the show n n1. The stage. It was pretty impressive to see the mechanics and engineering of the stage. n2. I enjoyed the scene where the ship sank and you can see the passengers drown into the water. A stream of bubbles floated down from the ceiling. Pretty amazing spectacle. n3. Second scene that I enjoyed that involved ZERO acrobats were the hand signs. Basically, a couple sat behind a lantern. They used their hands to make different type of creatures that is ""shadowed "" onto a huge screen in front of the stage. One of those, ""how did they do that moment? "" n nFinally, if you decide to attend the show, I would recommend the following na. Bring a pillow, you will fall asleep nb. Unlike other Cirque Du Soleil where any seat is a good seat, I would recommend buying tickets CLOSER to the stage. If you are seated in the back row, you do not get a true sense of the amazing stage mechanics. Trust me. this is absolute. if you sit in the back, you will fall asleep faster! nc. Go to the restroom BEFORE the show. It goes straight for an hour and 45 minutes or so. n nBest of luck!",1
"No better pizza or calzone in town. Friendly staff, good combo prices, awesome awesome food.",2
"Three words can pretty much sum up our visit, Delicious meat coma. The sides were pretty tasty too!",2
"All show, no go! Great looking food, huge portions but it all tastes off. From a little off to way off. The music was very loud and we just saw Motley Crew the night before, so we like loud music just not excruciating loud rap music while one is eating breakfast. The waitress's comment when we asked that it might be turned down . ""that's just how we roll "" sure let us know that we were not their top priority. nAnd they charge to share a plate that is absolutely disgusting. Great idea, poorly executed and horribly delivered. Oh by the way . probably the most expensive breakfast on the strip.",1
"Rich. Decadent. Extravagant. Those are some pretty good adjectives to describe Fleur de Lys. The restaurant is gorgeous and is a great setting for the amazing food they serve. I made reservations through Open Table and indicated that I wanted a table in a secluded, intimate part of the restaurant to celebrate a birthday. They obliged, seating us at a 2 top behind the curtains, right next to the private 'cabana' seating. It made for a perfectly romantic setting. n nWe both ordered the 'Elegance' tasting menu with wine pairings. n n AMUSE BOUCHE n Tempura cod with potatoes and creme fraiche n nCrispy on the outside, delicate on the inside. Great way to start the meal. Since we got the wine pairing, it also came with some sparkling wine. n n FIRST COURSE n Truffled onion soup with duck ragout and black truffles n Ahi tuna tartar with fennel slaw and ginger ponzu sauce n nThe soup was rich and creamy and the duck ragout was delicious. The tuna tartar was very good but I wasn't a huge fan of the fennel slaw. It gave the dish a little bit of an earthy taste and took away from the taste of the tuna, in my opinion. But, I'm no chef so who am I to second guess Hubert's recipe. n n SECOND COURSE n Pumpkin risotto with pecans n Chorizo stuffed sea bass n nThe risotto was one of the best dishes of the night, although I'm partial to anything that's pumpkin flavored. The sea bass was very good. The cut of fish was very meaty, flaky, and delicious and the chorizo provided a little kick. The wine it was paired with a Gruner, I believe was a perfect compliment. It was the best pairing of the night. n n THIRD COURSE n Stout braised short ribs n Filet mignon with foie gras and truffles n nThe filet was cooked perfectly medium , was very tender, and not overly seasoned. I ordered the foie gras with it even though I'm not a big fan maybe the idea of force feeding a duck to make it's liver tender for my benefit is a turn off for me. Although, obviously, it didn't bother me enough to prevent me from getting it. I do have to say that the foie gras was unbelievably soft and buttery. Thank you, Mr. Duck for sacrificing your organs in order to satisfy my appetite. Your life was clearly worth the 25 extra I had to pay for your liver and the truffles. All in all, it was a very good course. The epitome of a rich, decadent dish. n nAs good as the filet was, the short ribs were even better, in my opinion. I know, I'm crazy. how could they be better than a filet w foie gras and truffles? I'm not sure, but I just enjoyed the flavor of the short ribs more than the filet. Probably because it was braised in beer. It was definitely my favorite dish. n n FOURTH COURSE n Carrot cake with pineapple sorbet n Chocolate souffl u00e9 n White chocolate ganache n nThe desserts were good, but nowhere near as good as the other courses. The carrot cake was the best of the three. The white chocolate was rich, creamy and smooth. The souffl u00e9 was my least favorite. It's meant to be light, but it was too light for my tastes and was a little bitter and not sweet enough. A decent dish but not one that I would get again. n nWe finished the meal with some petite fours. Among them was a peanut butter one that was very sweet and delicious. The others were largely forgettable. But they were complimentary, so I can't really complain. n nThe service was excellent. While our server wasn't the most personable waiter I've had, he did a good job at managing our dining experience. Water glasses were never empty, dishes were cleared quickly, and our place settings were set promptly. The food runners did an exceptional job at explaining dishes when they were brought to the table. When we placed our orders at the beginning of the meal our server said that the wine pairings would be 2oz. each. But, thankfully he was a little generous with the pour, each time giving us about 4 5 oz. per glass. n nSo, how much did this meal set me back? um. 410.60, including the tip for the two of us.",2
Bad beer. Poor service. Good location. Cool growlers for sale.,1
"OMG! n nI LOVE this place! n nAfter reading all the wonderful reviews me and my friend Traci P have been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally did the other day. n nLet me tell you there food is amazing, delicious, marvelous, wonderful.you get the point. n nWe were promptly greeted by our wonderful waitress Denise, she had asked if we had eaten here before and we said no so she explained how it work and how to order she was very informative which I loved. I ordered the personal size pesto pizza with meatballs. This by far is probably the best pizza Ive ever tasted in my life! The crust is hand tossed and whatever dough they use is scrumptious, they topped that with the delicious creamy pesto sauce and generous amount of mozzarella cheese and the out of this world meatballs! You can tell they use all fresh ingredients and good quality products. The whole pizza went together very well I couldn't stop eating I ate til I was sick that's how good this pizza was. n nEven though I was stuffed from the wonderful pizza I had to order dessert I'm not only a sucker for desserts and have the worlds biggest sweet tooth but there homemade! nI ordered a oreo cheese cake, this piece of heaven melted in my mouth it was creamy fluffy goodness. n nI live less then 5 minutes from this restaurant and cant believe Ive been missing out on this place. n nI cant wait to return here again, cant go wrong with great food and awesome service.",2
"Was here last night as it was close to our hotel and we were in town for the game. nIt was very nice inside, clean and definitely my type of atmosphere. nWe were exhausted after the game, so didn't head back out until almost 9 to grab something to eat. It was a little louder than I usually like it to be when I'm tired and out for dinner, but it was 9 pm on a Saturday night, so should definitely be expected. nOther than that, the place was great. I loved the menu, there were about 10 things I wanted to try. nBut what I did have was great, the hot buffalo wings were AWESOME. and the Macaroni and Cheese Pizza I was super curious, as this isn't generally something found on a pizza was very good as well. nBeer great and the service was very good as well. nI will definitely go back the next time I'm in town.",2
"I'm from california and recently got back a Tumi briefcase I asked them to repair ripped linings and broken zipper and while they did make the best of what was given the briefcase was extremely used old , they forgot to patch up some of the inside pockets! n nBut when calling them again, they told me that they would be more than happy to stitch it all back up again as long as I remembered to label what needed to get fixed, and then offered to pay for the shipping!",2
"It is definitely not worth the drive. The server was pleasant , but the wait for the food to be served was way too long. The food was not worth the wait either. The foie gras was a disappointment. The best part of the dining was the view of the lake beside the restaurant.",1
I ate here on the advice of a co worker. The price was decent and the good was good. A bit smokey walking into the business as you pass by the outside grills. Overall a fair meal for a fair price.,2
"I grew up and lived in and around philly til i moved here two years ago. I always wished there was a Ritas here. n nImagine my delight when I moved not two miles from where they were building a Ritas! I watched with eager anticipation as the shop came together. n nFinally, they opened. I found out first from Yelp. I was abashed to read the reviews and was nervous about trying it. n nBut tonight was the night. The test. I brought my 3 kids, 2 of whom had never tasted ritas. n nWe ordered 4 water ices. They gave my daughter a taste of the orange colored tropical flavor first for free. We also had cherry, sugar free cherry for me and lemonade. n nAll were delicious. The sugar free is a little lacking in flavor, but thats normal for the chain. n nThere were two firemen inside as we ordered, and a truckfull arrived as we were leaving. n nThe owner was present and mentioned he was from philly. So we started a conversation. He asked where i found him, and i mentioned yelp. He politely asked for a positive review. n n nNow, as a previous small biz owner myself, i have to tell you that its a common and smart biz practice to ask for reviews. All the biz books recommend it. I have had no problem asking for reviews of my business and I have no problem with other businesses asking for reviews either. If someone opens a new yelp account because they like my business, i think thats great. I would hope they would continue on yelp, but if not, that wouldnot really be in my control, just as it is not in the control of this ritas owner.Of course if there are fraudulent reviews, that would be wrong, however, I believe he was just soliciting positive reviews. The owner seemed genuinely upset about all the yelp contraversy. n nWell, he got a good review from me. No complaints. n nIn fact, My two year old dropped his water ice right off, and they replaced it with no questions asked and no charge. n nI give a five stars for quality of product and service. I wish there was more seating, all there is is a bench outside, but hey. Its a ritas. They normally dont have much in the way of seating. n nOverall 5 stars.",2
People are right about this place. Overpriced and disappointing. We paid 41 per person for the meal and it was definitely NOT worth of the money. It was about golden coral quality snow crab legs. Oh well I'm done with buffet binge eating now between MGM and wicked spoon ruined my appetites,1
Just came back from their Sunday Brunch. It was about 15 per person unless you have kids under 4 which are free. The brunch is a great way to try a lot of items in one sitting. They have an omelet station which was decent but I came for the German food. Also at the omelet station was roast beef which was just OK. They have about 30 other lunch items on the buffet. The best part by far is the dessert section which included about 10 additional items. It was not the best German I have had but I would not expect that from a buffet.

"truth be told, the only reason we dined at this place was because we mistakenly Yelp'd directions to the Firefly that was in the same shopping center that has since relocated. but thankfully, this place did not disappoint! n nwe got there around 9ish for drinks and a late dinner as we were still up in the air as far as our plans for the evening. i was initially surprised that this place wasn't as packed as most thai food spots or restaurants in Las Vegas in general . i couldn't quite place why, since the drinks were pretty good, the venue had a lot of space both at the bar and in the dining portion of the restaurant, and we were able to order and get our food drinks relatively quickly. n nSatay is a pretty trendy spot, it seems that it'd be a fun place to enjoy the night close to the Strip if you want to drink and eat on the cheap. intimate lighting, lots of bar space, cool decor, and their food is tasty and authentic, not some type of Americanized version of thai food! n n civilities.",2
"Bad news for me. I just moved within biking distance of LGO. Yeah, their food is healthy and all these vegetarian and vegan options, but. dang.

"Been here a number of times for lunch. nThe biggest plus of this place is the ambiance and spaciousness, which is in stark contrast with most of the restaurants in Oakland that are crowded, noisy, and feel a little claustrophobic. nWhile the ambience is great, the food could be better and is OVERPRICED. n nAMBIENCE nThe ambience here is outstanding. It is spacious. The ceilings are high, and there is lots of natural lighting from the large windows. The architecture on the building is great. I like the lanterns above the main entrance and large fireplace as you enter. There is also a lot of outside seating, which I presume would be great when the weather is warmer outside. It is right next to Schenley Park, with lots of green space around. I've been here a number of times with colleagues and it is a great place to talk. n nFOOD nFor lunch, you order at the front and grab a number. There are salads, sandwiches, and pizzas. I've had both the sandwiches 9 or 10 and the pizzas 11 14. nWhile the crispy taters that come with the sandwiches are very good, crisp and fresh, the sandwiches left more to be desired. If you don't mind the extra few , go for the pizza. They have a wood oven, which they use to bake the pizzas. I've had the Bianca pizza 13 the the fig name was very sweet and went well with the goat cheese and mozzarella mixed with arugula.",2

If you don't wanna walk the 6 miles like my friends and I do, take a cabby but it will be worth the trip.",2
"I enjoyed the lunch buffet at Pink Pepper on Bell Rd. in Phoenix, so I had to try this location in Mesa for the lunch buffet too. I really enjoyed my meal, from the crispy tempura veggies not Thai, I know, but darn good to the salt and pepper chicken, to the savory beef and chicken dishes especially that delightful crispy chicken in creamy sauce. And they had two tofu dishes, both good a plus for me, since not too many buffets serve tofu, which I love. The fried rice and the pad thai were just OK, and dessert was limited to cubed fresh fruit, sweet fried noodles, orange slices, and those small doughnuts found in most Asian buffets. The buffet dishes were on big portable buffet carts in a very dimly lit area of the restaurant, suggesting that perhaps the restaurant had not originally planned to offer buffet when it was being conceived. I wish that they had at least put lamps in there to light up the dishes being served. Nevertheless, I found the food to be good and the service attentive, though more businesslike than friendly. A pleasant buffet dining experience overall.",2
"We have bought Chrysler products from two dealers in Madison. n nThe first was Russ Darrow. They do some things that make buying a new car a greasy experience. Salesman is very nice but can't do anything except talk about car and offer a test drive. Then they hand you off to the numbers guy. Good luck buying a car without pinstripes or rustproofing, which they apply to EVERY car. n nMy son and I bought a car at Don Miller last week. A much more pleasant experience. The salesman handled all negotiations. The car had no tacky add ons. The finance person knew we were leasing and didn't pressure us into warranties, she did tell us about maintenance packages which we accepted, but there was no pressure. Even better they didn't campaign for a high rating on the inevitable Chrysler dealer service survey. n nIf we buy another Chrysler product it will be from this dealership.",2

Service HORRIBLE. nWe had a reservation and they made us wait for 25 min. They did not have the courtesy of apologizing for making us wait. Trust me it was not a pleasure waiting with two kids.

"I'm really sad I have to come back and udate my review. We visited Island again last Friday and had a pretty bad experience. The service was AWFUL. We went as a group of 6. all ordered AYCE. We had to wait almost 40 minutes between our first order and our second. That's really unacceptable. n nAs far as we could see, there were only 2 guys actually making the sushi. On a Friday night at 6 30? That's crazy. And that would probably explain what the hold up was. n nOur waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on. When we finally flagged down a DIFFERENT server to ask what the problem was, he acted like he couldn't care less. ""Yeah, we know we're having problems. You have 90 minutes, don't worry.

"Sushi Kame is tied for my favorite place to get sushi in Champaign. The sushi is very good. If you're going for lunch the bento boxes are hard to beat when it comes to bang for your buck! I've always been happy with the food. The service is OK, I've never had the long wait times that some others here have posted about. I guess my only complaint is that I tried the Chirashizushi once and while it was good propotions and delicious it was one of the less ornate presentations I've had. Of course for the price I couldn't really complain. So yeah if you're in the CU area and looking for sushi, this is one of the two places I would recommend!",2
"Let's be clear right up front this grade is for the Market as a whole, not the individual vendors. East End Brewing, Caffe D'Amore, Crested Duck, these are all great, vital businesses. n nBut the rest of the market is just a jumble of half baked ideas. The old space was pretty but felt unfinished, so I was hopeful when they moved to a new space.sadly, it's even worse. The space has all the charm of a garage, and little is done to give it a market feeling. Also, the selection of vendors leans too heavily on pre prepared foods and home goods. Why isn't the farmer's market at the firehouse part of this? Where are the local farmers with fresh produce? Other than picking up a growler from East End and a latte from Caffe D'Amore, why am I here? n nPeople give Cleveland a bad rap, but their West Side Market devastates this showing Hell, it gives the whole Strip District a run for its money . With all of the abundant produce and farms in this, one of the most fertile regions in the county, it's sad that our public market is so disappointing.",1
"My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out while we were in Las Vegas for the weekend. The menu looked good, so I was pretty excited about eating here. nWe had to wait a little while for a table maybe 15 20 minutes , which was no big deal. But then, it took 30 minutes for us to get coffee also, you can't just order a coffee you have to get a foofy, sugary espresso drink and over an hour for all of our food to arrive. There were only about 10 tables in the whole restaurant and at least 5 employees working, so I can't see any reason that it should take that long. When the people sitting beside us asked about their food they had received half of their food and waited 30 40 minutes for the rest, which never came , the owner gave them a condescending and long winded speech about how she ""refuses to have "" industrial kitchen equipment and that they ""should know "" that her food comes out slowly. She even argued with them when they very reasonably and politely asked her not to charge them for food they didn't receive. She also talked about how she ""refuses "" to prepare food in advance including mixing batter or cutting vegetables. While I appreciate the sentiment of all of this, it is totally impractical. I get small batch food prep, but there is absolutely no reason for a breakfast joint not to have, like, a waffle maker that can make more than 1 waffle at a time. I don't mind waiting a bit for good food, but 1 2 hours is ridiculous, especially when it doesn't even come out at the same or even close to the same time. nThe food was pretty good, but it was really expensive for the portion size. nThis is a place that is run by a woman on a high horse who has no idea how to operate a business. nI will say that, aside from the owner, the staff are very, very nice. They work hard and are very kind polite, but they are stuck working for a very poorly run business.",1

"I like trying new things. Its fun and hip. While killing some time before doing side work on a Sunday, I did a Yelp Search and poof Fate Brewing popped up. Lets review n n Fud Drink nThe food here is pretty urban and ""gastropub ish "" if you ask me. I had the Scarlet Skillet Omelet see pic which was very good. Everything mixed together very well, even if it looks like something your cat yacked up.it was very good. I ordered a bloody beer they actually name it that on the menu, score with their light ale. All their dishes look good, prices are a tad high but the quality is there. Of the crafts they brew, all but 1 was dark or very hoppy, which is why they lose a whole star. The variety simply was not there if you like anything relatively light or refreshing. n nEven the ale they gave me was a Pale Ale which, I am not a fan of. It had the traditional PA hoppy kick. It tasted good with my bloody mix in it.but still, where is the variety? The guest beers were also all very hoppy or dark, so even if I jumped over to the guest list its difficult. I know its winter, but not every winter beer HAS to be dark. I am still getting used to dark beers, so I am totally up to trying new things. but give me variety! n n Atmosphere Service nThis place has a hipster feel to it. A lot of ironic items throughout, like the tool bench drawer used to cart off used growlers or old drinks.or some of the chairs which are made out of random materials. The large stone bar top is inviting and spacious, allowing for a lot of items to be strewn across. A comparable amount of tables are inside, as well as a short but sweet patio up front. Service was good, one barkeep for the lot of us at the bar on a Sunday is OK. He was helpful and gave me a couple samples to try. Nothing overwhelming in either direction.nice guy. It definitely has an open, relaxing feel to it. Really relaxing and comforting place to head over to on a Sat Sun morning, I feel. You won't look feel like an alchy if you come in for a drink or two and get some brunch. n n The Down Low nGood solid spot to unwind, upscale in some aspects, with an emphasis on hipsterism in some areas. Come on down, its a fun place to be as you can tell that a lot of beer enthusiasts come here. They get 4 stars for fun refreshing set up, good mix on menu, well made craft beers, and an inviting atmosphere.",2

"Love this place. Rich red velvet curtains, vintage chandeliers, White leather chairs with rollers. Ambiance very high end. Simple elegance. I started my meal with the Mussel appetizer.wow.the sauce was a mixture of sherry and chorizo.the taste was the best I've had in years. I also had a Ranch Cesar salad and Steak Sandwich. The steak sandwich was delicious but there was so much gristle in the steak it was hard to eat, The waitress gave us a free desert on the house because of it, so all was fine. Hubby had the Tuna Panini with apples and grapes, His Fries were really crispy and all in all the meal was great. It was our first time having fried ice cream and it was a perfect ending to our meal. The Bathrooms were immaculate and well stocked. Our waitress was very pleasant and had alot of great suggestions. We will definitely go again soon.",2

"Everytime I come to this location I always have two slices of cheese pizza. One of the most rewarding things to consume! The pizzas are very good here. For me, the flavor of the sauce is just right and they know the exact ratio of cheese to sauce when the make their pies. I personally like reheating the cheese pizzas in the oven NO MICROWAVE because the dough gets a bit crispier. Great texture.They have other stuff on the menu but I just stick to what makes me happy. Two slices of cheese sit back, relax and eat it as fast as you can before it gets cold.",2

The veggie combo advertised a few of the items hummus, taboulli salad, falafel, and pita bread that it included and ""much more "". Well, there wasn't anything more in my veggie combo that wasn't named on the menu. Didn't like the falafel much, kinda dry. The hummus was less than ordinary. The best part was the fresh pita bread and the rolled fillo pastry that I had. I would buy some of their fresh pit bread to take home. It's a decent place to stop for a snack, I guess. Still the fact remains, I ordered takeout stuck my food in the fridge for later because I enjoy leftovers and just ended up throwing it out because it wasn't enticing me to eat it at all. So I'm still searching for a good Mediterranean RESTAURANT dining experience not a deli.",1
"Although initially let down by how few vendors there were the first time I went, I'm a believer in Vincent's market for the wood burning pizza oven. I've gone three times now. For me, there's nothing like going for a leisure run along the canal Saturday morning and hanging a right at 40th Street to get replenished at Vincent's. I think the 8 pizzas are the best pizza I've had so far in metro Phoenix, if not Arizona. There are so many choices smoked salmon, regular pepperoni, avocado. The crust is thin and just the right amount of crunchy. My favorite so far, but probably one of the most fattening, is the tarte flambe cream, bacon and fresh thyme. Licking my lips just writing that. I notice that when Vincent himself is operating the oven, he still makes time to chat and charm patrons. I also had a mini ratatouille tart which was excellent. All the vegetables were a nice texture and the crust was great, but you could taste the butter in it. You can also get grilled half chicken plate with vegetables and potatoes for 5. A great deal. However, the later you go, the drier the chicken might be. I plan to go back and try paninis, paellas and some of their other delicacies. n nThe only thing is you must possess vulture like reflexes to grab a table if you want to eat there. There are more crowds than tables and chairs. n nThe vendors that are there have some decent wares to peddle. I was excited to find a woman there who sells farm fresh eggs since the downtown farmer's market always runs out. Also, just picked up some really yummy, not overly sugary raspberry jam.

"My husband and I have had mixed feelings in the past but decided to give it another chance. We were disappointed again. We sat in the bar and ordered drinks from a very nice server. We ordered an appetizer a bruschetta with veg and shrimp that was good. We had high expectations after that. I ordered the cashew tilapia, which used to be pecan tilapia, and it was not as tasty as the pecan, but ok. My husband ordered the fish stew and was surprised when it arrived. The waitress told us it came with a lobster tail on the top. Well it wasn't a stew at all and contained a few small shrimp, a few clams, muscles a tiny cob of corn mostly potatoes and to top it off the lobster was thermidor all mushy and unappetizing. . For 28.00 into even close to a value. Because our waitress disappeared,my husband flagged down the manager. She apologized and stated that was the recipe sent by corporate! They need to rethink that dish,as it is awful. They also need to bring back pecan tilapia and forget the cashew coating not as tasty. It has such a nice atmosphere, but I can see why it is not crowded like the other restaurants we visited prior. The manager did take it off the bill, but by then our dinner was a disappointment. We eat out often and won't go there again. Come on corporate! There are so many delicious recipes, get out the cookbook!",1
"One of the gems of Ahwatukee! Hidden discreetly in an old strip mall, MWC hits you with an unexpected, fresh dose of casual classiness as soon as you enter. Comfy couches, nice lighting, great little patio overlooking a golf course, suuuper friendly and attentive staff, and a pretty good happy hour make this place awesome in my book. nWine selection exceeds my palate, and they even have an eclectic offering of microbrews for beer drinkers like myself. Haven't tried the fare, so no opinion on the food. Highly recommended if you find yourself on a date.great place to enjoy conversation and a glass of fermented grapes.",2
"So disappointing! Went to the tasting menu they had back around x mas and it was bad! The chef started the meal announcing to everyone that they had changed the menu three times before preparing it for that night, believe me it showed!

I had been in before and had some of their regular menu items, this just really assured that I will not be back.",1
"I've eaten at Big Grove only two times. The first time I went for lunch and had the eggplant sandwich and it was delicious. I sat a table and had decent service. The second time I went I met a friend and we sat at the bar. The bartender was inattentive and did not get me a water when I asked the first time. He kept walking away before I got a chance to finish ordering everything and he didn't smile once. When I finally got my food, my medium burger was almost well done, the lettuce on the burger was so soggy it dripped off my burger, and the fries were so salty that they made my stomach hurt. I couldn't finish my burger or the fries and it was extremely overpriced. I would not recommend this restaurant unless you just go for drinks or the eggplant sandwich. You will pay too much and get less than mediocre, almost inedible food.",1

"Unfortunately I had an absolute horrible experience with LifeQuest Chiropractic. First off I would like to say that the actual service was great. I was in a very bad car accident which lead me to seek treatment. I originally found a Groupon online because I was in very severe pain and needed a massage to help ease the pain. The treatment itself was with Sarah. Which, at times may be a little bit too painful for most people because of how much pressure is used but since I wasn't necessarily going in there for a ""relaxing "" massage I didn't mind. n nI then spoke to the doctor along with the patient coordinator about seeking further treatment for my back injury. After much discussion I decided to go ahead with the treatment. I was very clear that I wanted to use my medical insurance. Keep in mind the whole time they had a copy of my health care provider and well aware that I was planning on using it. Both the doctor and the patient coordinator assured me that I would be ""covered "". That being said, I took their word and proceeded with treatment. n nI was in treatment for 2.5 months and got check ins every four weeks. Meanwhile, I had asked several times of what my total bill was this far just to keep informed. They refused to tell me and said they ""only bill everything at the end. "" I should have known right then and there something was wrong. n nLong story short I was mislead and misinformed by LifeQuest and was indeed NOT covered. In fact it wasn't until after the fact they told me that they did not take my health care provider. Something they should have been up front and honest about right from the beginning. I now have a 4,600 bill with my health care provider due to the lack of communication and honesty from LifeQuest. n nAs I stated before, the actual service from the massage therapist were great. But as far as actual honesty from the doctor I will never go to LifeQuest or refer anyone to them from my experience. My treatments ended in October of last year and I am still fighting with my health care provider from the claims of LifeQuest.",1
"This Business has been my go to Sushi restaurant for some time now. It's a small quaint establishment. The food is good and and they have a great selection for everyone.even if you don't like sushi.

I had a wonderful meal here! n nyellowtail serrano so sadly I can't remember, but instead of the yellowtail, we got a different type of yellowtail that was butterier than regular yellowtail. Can a sushi expert help me out here? Anyway, it was sitting in a blood orange sauce with little serrano peppers and micro cilantro. The presentation was beautiful and the dressings were subtle, not cutting into the glorious stand alone flavor of the fish itself. n nfoie gras torchon two slices of foie gras with a nicely sized scallop, and an oyster. break it down! I would have liked to see the foie gras seared, but that's ok, that's ok, it was still a decadent heap of fatty goodness that dissolved on my tongue bite after bite. The oyster was perfectly cooked, which is to say, nearly not cooked on the inside. It was fresh and delicious, but I could lose the weird crunchy balls that had been sprinkled no the top. Nearly ruined it for me. And lastly the japanese oyster sitting in the middle off the plate was to die for. Meaty, fresh and not fish. It didn't taste horrendously like the sea. It was covered in watery, salty juices. It was just a clean, fat, oyster. n nToro and scallion roll there's not much to say. They make this everywhere because it's a classic and it works. The fish was good, the rice was good, it was a solid roll, But not if you're looking for something special. n nUni sushi Since this is synonymous with awesome, there is nothing more I can say. n nAnd the Bellagio is such a beautiful and romantic place. You really can't ask for more for a lovely, romantic, dining experience.",2
Worst place ever! Sitting here having my dinner and they shut down the hot bar which was fine but the dessert bar too? I'm still eating my dinner. Confused I keep eating and see one of the kitchen members throwing old food from inside the hot boxes right on the floor in front of us while we finish. How disgusting!,1
"I take clients to clubs for lunch when I am in Charlotte on business. I travel all over and was not expecting much in Charlotte. I had gone to one uptown club a few times and it was nice. I went to a Friday lunch special at The Men's Club from a hotel referral. It is remarkably nice inside, good staff, good music and a better menu than the hotel I was staying in. It was something I would have expected in Las Vegas, not Charlotte. I will go back every time I am in town.",2
"Its good food. great happy hour. There is 2 good servers during happy hour. but everyone else are retards people here are not so smart and don't know how to do transactions. we did a pick up order asked for double cut on our pizza. they wanted us to wait another 10 mins to double cut the pizza should of yelled at them therefore our food was cold, dominos would have been bettter. but they probably would of freaked out and quit felt bad for the cashier. she should do us all of us a favor and quit. but over all food is good people that work there are so so so so dumb. but 2 waitresses that work happy hour .",1

"This place is horrible. Took an android and an iPhone to get the screen replaced and both have problems with the touch screen. The guy that actually makes the repairs is looking to Nickel and dime you for everything including 20 dollars for screws he forgot to put back. Horrible customer service. Save yourself the hassle and stress. Go to a pro because your phone won't work right and he doesn't guarantee any service at all. His excuse for everything ""Apple is a pain in the neck, they are too smart. """,1
"Came here for some pho and spring rolls after hearing this place recommended by some co workers. Definitely will not be going back. n nDrove up and the place looked completely run down from the outside. No problems, I'm cool with that, I've certainly climbed into my fair share of the hole in the wall restaurants in San Francisco and Hong Kong. The places that look like their housing criminals but you can't help but forgive it because the food is oh so good. n nToo bad Da Vang wasn't like that. The table wasn't cleaned properly and there were what looked like dried hoi sin sauce on the table. I had to go through 3 spoons before I found one that didn't have dried food particles clinging to it and then another 5 to find a clean one for my girlfriend. That is just completely wrong. Utensils should be clean not having the last guy's lunch still clinging to it! n nI was really hoping the food was good. I told myself if the food was good I can live with it. The portion was freaking huge on the XL special pho bowl but half way through the meal I realized it was mostly noodles. The meat was less than most places and the broth was only so so in taste. n nHole in the walls are usually the best kept secrets, unfortunately Da Vang didn't have the cleanliness or the taste to keep me coming back.",1
"Dal Toro. more like Dal Terrible! We were duped by the 12.50 breakfast sign. Good marketing. n nWhen we came in they asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We opted for inside. We sat a bit and observed. All the other patrons needed things and the servers were frantically running around. We realized that every server outside had a couple tables inside, which made NO sense. Call me crazy, but why wouldn't you have a server devoted to inside tables and other servers devoted to tables outside. I know I'm a total genius. unfortunately who ever was planning did not share my genius qualities. n nIf you do arrive make sure you bring a flag because if you need ANYTHING be prepared to flag anyone and everyone down. We never got refills on their crappy coffee, had to beg for refills for water and then there was the food. n n Gagging as I think about it I wanted the veggie omelet with no mushrooms and was told the omelets were already premade. That makes no sense to combine all the veggies and pre make them. How much time are you really saving and then freshness is seriously compromised! I settled for the salmon and shrimp omelet. how bad could that be? Uh B A D ! My husband got old reliable, eggs benedict. Well both plates were disgusting. My omelet was super fishy the shrimp was obviously frozen. The potatoes that joined each of our entrees were soggy and swimming in oil. To make things worse it was cold. blah! I took a few bites and left the rest. It was inedible. My hubby's eggs benedict came with very little hollendaise sauce. The sauce was white not yell. The eggs were not runny. They were cooked all the way through and was also cold. We thought about sending the food back, but it would sitll be lousy. This place is NASTY! The food is NASTY! I will never set foot in this ""restaurant "" again! n nService Bad nFood Bad nQuality Bad nFreshness Bad nPrice Bad nDecor Corny n nSTAY AWAY! You've been warned",1
"This place is meh. I have no idea why its always full. As a previous reviewer mentioned, they did not carry a specific item I was wanting, in my instance however it was a diablito I was looking for.",1
My favorite straight up NY style pepperoni pizza in town.,2
"Drove up on a Monday afternoon. This place was so jammed with cars. The guy that came up to me with his clipboard told me that the car in front of me had already been waiting for 2o min. There is a large sign on the top of the wash with the prices. I wanted around a 20 to 25 buck wash. I have a newer car and the outside needed to be primarily clean. The guy told me he could give me another wash for 60 buck. I was like well I don't want that I want a regular car wash! No detail, no wax! Just wash it! He then told me it would be hour and a half to 2 hour wait. So I kindly told him I would be leaving. Then another guy says I will make it worth your while sticking his ballpoint pen into a chip on my window. Ugh! Don't be sticking your pens in places they don't belong. So I left. And was pissed I trusted yelp reviews and drove 15 min to this location.",1
"A museum dedicated to Mustard? Who knew.? My Wife is in love with travel oddities and the Mustard museum was right up her alley. Although I have to admit, I enjoyed myself. n n The best thing about this potpourri of Grey Poupon is you have the chance to sample any of the hundreds of mustard's sold in the store. We ended up purchasing five bottles on our way out. So not only was our visit enjoyable, we're stocked up on mustard until doomsday. It was well worth the trip.",2
This place is great. The food is cheap and the noodles are wonderful. For 7 you can get different hand cut noodle dishes. They give you the option for thick or thinner noodles which makes my heaven customizable. The staff is really friendly and fast. It's a little off the beaten path but well worth it.,2
I come here about once a year and then I remember why I don't come here more often. My car was next in line to get washed and 3 corp vans were moved in front of me. And now I wait. Will prob take 40 mins to get out of here .,1
This is the worst McDonalds I have ever been to. I have come here twice and each time they mess up my order. They can't speak English which is probably why they can't get my order right. The play place has no doors so the kids just run around everywhere. Don't go here and waste your hard earned money.,1
"Came here just for the frozen hot chocolate. The serving for two is perfect to share. The other couple we were with thought it was too sweet, but my boyfriend and I love sweets so we finished it haha. n nFrom what I saw other tables ordering, I wouldn't come here for food. It just looks like typical American diner food from Denny's. n nThe restaurant smelled like cheese which kind of grossed me out, but it was too hot to sit outside. n nKinda overpriced for a drink 14 I think , but nice to say you've tried it. Probably won't be back since there are other places on my Vegas list to check off.",1
"First time ever at Lawry's in Vegas. Small place, more intimate. Same concept, food still delicious, great service. I had a great time. If you havent been to Lawry's Vegas, its worth checking it out. Imagine walking from your Hotel on the strip to Lawry's? Too bad its far away from the strip.",2
"I happened to be in Montreal during a weekend in late August for a bachelor party and had booked this Quality Hotel for the occasion. I did not fair nearly as well as past reviewers though. I ended up paying about 160 per room through Expedia. n nCheck in was a breeze and the front desk clerk was friendly and efficient. She was also able to suggest a nearby parking garage as they were rented out and restaurants in the area. Unfortunately our rooms were on separate floor and one was on an ""upgraded "" floor but we could not see much of a difference save a few different pieces of furniture in the hallway and rooms. n nThe room itself was kept fairly clean except for a decent size stain on the carpet. The room had a flat screen TV with a fair selection of English and French channels. Also present in the room is a coffee maker. The cabinet dresser has a door to accommodate a mini fridge but alas no fridge. We were out most of the night and did not return until about 5 00 am at which time it was quiet so I can't comment on the noise isolation. The beds were OK, a bit stiff. One complaint I have is that we had the air conditioner jacked up to full and it was still pretty sticky. Free WiFi was a nice plus. n nThe location of the hotel is what makes this place. Being downtown, pretty much everything is walkable which was a big plus for us. n nOverall, I'd say we were paying for the location more than anything. The hotel itself and amenities were par or sub par in most cases.",1
Yucky yucky yuck pizza undercooked and bbq chkn looking like charcoal at least we got refunded right away big mess of food. Yikes defy will not order again.,1
"Like real fire stations this chain of sandwich shops are popping up all over Las Vegas, so this afternoon after picking up a ""friend "" from a long working night and driving by one of them we decided to give it a try. It was lunch time so the place was really packed, so packed I'm not sure they were following the maximum capacity imposed by the real firehouse, but this place was really on fire! n The outside looked really plain, but when you walk inside it's really cool it looks like a real fire station lots of red, diamond steel, firemen memorabilia all over the walls and Dalmatian color tables which creates a fun atmosphere while you enjoy your sandwich. n Sandwiches were good, nothing special that sets them apart from all the other sandwich places except that you can pick your level of fire since they carry more than fifty kinds of hot sauces, chances are they have your favorite sorry no Del Scorcho . n My friend was so impressed with the theme, she told me that she should get together a group of her colleagues and start a sandwich chain Just like the group of doctors that opened that other healthy sandwich shops and now this group of firemen opening this chain. I had to tell her and burst her bubble at the same time that maybe it wasn't a good idea to use her type of profession as a theme for a sandwich shop, I mean. what are you girls going to call it? Hooker's corner subs? n All in all firehouse is a good place to take your family and have a good time and good food. The new dial a soda machine is real cool! I just wish people would stop playing with it, Is not a toy! Is a soda machine and that's what all the people behind you want.a soda! nWill I be back? Sure! I kinda like their sandwiches .unless my friend opens her own place, then I would probably be eating hers.but for now, any sandwich shop close to my friend's corner is good enough for me.",2
"CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN People eat here! They have reasonably priced go to meals to satisfy you for lunch, a casual date or a hangover binge. Real good stuff in pretty packages. n nTHE MEAT The place is low key, and probably looks much better at night. They have a chiller stocked with sake and friendly Japanese servers. They placed a plastic kiddie bowl and spork in front of my son. Cute. But I wish more of these places served fruit juice for the little ones. We settled for the Yuzu limeade. It was good, but for my taste a little too sweet and tangy it made my jaw tingle and think of a concentrate . The salmon oshizushi was tasty, the rice may be thick but the salty cured fish and eggs balance it out. Hubby and I go gaga for any Jap sesame dressing on salad, I love the fact that their tempura sauce comes with grated radish, their half bowl udon kake was substantial and very good, and finally their Katsu Don pork on rice with egg was excellent. We were happy stuffed. n nThe few items we were not so pleased with was the Kakuni, braised pork belly the cut was surprisingly lean and just missed the mark of pork belly fatty orgasm and the Zuke Tororo, marinated tuna and grated yam instead or slices of tuna, we had a tartare next to a bed weird slimy and not very pleasant tasting tororo . Next time we'll try the other small plates, with sake and. dessert. Definitely dessert. n nI'M STILL DIGESTING. that slimy tororo. It reminded me of. coarse Elmer's glue.",2
Best dive bar. Cheap drinks. Laid back patrons and staff. No one turns to see who just walked in.,2
"I was just in Vegas with my 6 year old so I was looking for a Kid Friendly show in the evening and this seemed perfect! n nFirst off, the service was terrible! My son wanted orange juice instead of soda and you have to order that from the bar waitress not the regular server with the soda pitchers. And I literally asked our bar waitress FIVE TIMES for plain orange juice for my son. He finally got it 45 minutes into the show! By that time he was trying to choke down the super dry chicken and overcooked potatoes and a liquid beverage would have come in handy. He finally resorted to drinking some of my soda which he HATES just to have something! n nSecondly, the show also starts really slow! Lots of cheesy jokes and training the audience to yell ""Huzzah "" and gratuitous dancing wenches on the tables. This goes on for about 20 minutes. Once the knights appeared the action picked up and it was fine. n nI'm glad I got a 2 1 deal.",1

"Our favorite restaurant. Pasta and bread is homemade and excellent. Calzones and pizza are very good and reasonably priced. Love the lasagna. Staff is very friendly. not sure why anyone cares that the food is brought to you on a cart . Whenever friends and family come in from out of town, this is where I take them. Truly never heard anyone not like anything that was ordered. Highly recommend this place.",2
"Slow service. Water ordered before food, and when food showed up, and the one time the server checked in on us, showed up at the same time as the check. Briosh French toast is made on wonderbread, not Briosh.",1

At no time did they approach us while we were working out to ASK if I were training. When we said we were taking turns, the staff too an unnecessary arrogant and combative stance and blurted ""it was presumed and we would be kicked out if we did it again "". WTH, I pay your salary and you need to get the facts straight BEFORE attacking.

"The pizza here is ok. n nI seen signs of a new pizza place opening in Ahwatukee and couldn't wait to try it out. n I've been disappointed in other pizza places that opened in the area, so I was skeptical. nAnyway I ordered an 18 "" sausage pizza, waited for about 20 minutes and brought it home. The pie was a whopping 25 bucks tax. nThe pizza review, the crust was hard and chewy, the sauce was put on sparingly and had a little kick to it, it had very little cheese and just a few sprinkles of sausage, Seriously it had about 7 pieces of sausage on the whole 18 "" pie! I thought they actually made a mistake, and called to speak to a manager about it, the ""manager "" said that it was the proper amount of sausage as they weight the toppings product for every pizza. I thought that was bull, how can you sell a proper premium pizza then skimp on the toppings? n nThe Verdict Bad Jimmy Joe! nThe prices at Jimmy Joe's are too high for the poor quality and quantity of pizza you get. So Jimmy. Joe.You get Only 2 Stars n nThe next time I pay for a 25 dollar pie, It will be at Spinato's Pizzeria, not jimmy n joe's, at least at Spinato's you get what you pay for, an abundance of toppings and the quality and taste matches that of a premium pizza.",1
"Worst airport ever. I understand and am totally ok with being searched by another female as long as its a search that every women gets regardless of race. They are afraid to offend certain races. I wore a long dress and was searched but they certainly didn't search the woman wearing a head wrap and a long dress.

"So, a group of 6 girls went to dinner for my best friend's kick off dinner for her bachelorette weekend. We originally wanted to go to the buffet at Bellagio but when we got there, it was about 10 30 PM and most of the restaurants in Vegas were closing restaurants in Vegas actually close! That didn't dawn on us. . Since we were staying at Caesars, we thought of the restaurants in the hotel and thought of Mr. Flay. I called and they said if we hurried over, we may still be able to be seated. So we hustled over from the Bellagio and were seated. YAY! n nWe were all starving after all flying into Vegas and having such a late dinner. We munched on the free bread which was nothing spectacular. After reading over the menu, we made our selections one ordered the pork tenderloin, another ordered the salmon, two ordered the chicken, and one ordered the cioppino. I had a NY strip because nothing really jumped out at me. It was cooked to a perfect rare and it tasted fine but nothing very special or fancy about it. n nWe split the following sides n Corn good but very, very creamy. It might be a little rich for some people n Mashed potatoes good and creamy. n Tamale horrible. It was sweet and tangy, really funky tasting. It wasn't just me. everyone at the table agreed. n nAt the end of dinner, everyone was not impressed with their dishes. In fact, we all were disappointed and joked about being better off going to the 24 hr caf u00e9. I was so excited to finally try his restaurant after hearing so many good things and watching him on Food Network for all these years. But, epic failure. n nI would not go there again, or try Bobby Flay's cooking again either.",1
All the dishes tasted the same.,1
"This is the worst fast food franchise in town. n nThe drive through is slow. The food is inconsistent. The staff are ambivalent. n nAveraging over a minute per vehicle in the drive through isn't ""fast "". Serving burgers with mere samples of the veggies in the marketing material demonstrates poor attention to detail, if not inventory management problems. n nThey can't even consistently pack bags so that the fries stay in their containers. Why bother with the containers at all if the fries are just going to be scattered throughout the bag? n nThe franchises in Sun Prairie and De Forest remain ""east side "" options, but I'm giving up on this location. Four chances in two years, and they never got it right.",1
"I had heard the food was good and the portions were big. n nThe food was great. The portions were huge. I had the meatloaf sandwich, when it was brought out to me, I had to devise a strategy to eat it, it was so big. But eat it I did, the whole thing, although it wasn't pretty. Might not be the place to take a first date, since there is no dignified way to eat eat this sandwich. But, oh lords, was it good. Delicious meatloaf, a tasty homemade ketchup, and a fresh bun. So, so good. n nFries were not bad either, but I could only eat about three of them after polishing off the sandwich. Then I was fed for the day, maybe two days. It was so good. n nI ate at the bar, the bartender was very sweet and brought me everything I needed, including extra napkins. I gave her a good tip because, well, she had to watch me eat that thing. Place was very nice overall, cool decor with a lot of stainless steel. n nSo go there soon. But only if you are seriously hungry. You've been warned.",2

"I came to VooDoo Lounge for my cousin's wedding reception, with a party of about 30 people. Being that it was my first trip ever to Vegas, the view from the 50th floor roof deck of the Rio was astounding, with great photo ops at night with The Strip all lit up. n nAside from the view, my experience here SUCKED. Really. One of the two stars I've rated it is just for the view, because the food was nothing to write home about, and in fact, they seriously fucked up a lot of the event. n nFirst off, our reservations were at 6pm, but we weren't seated till 6 30 because they weren't ready for us. It was not a big deal, as we were able to enjoy our cocktails outside on the deck. When we finally were seated, the bride almost had an aneurism because they had spelled her last name wrong on the menu. That is serious bad form, not even getting the bride's name right on a keepsake item. The dinner was a four course meal with several items to choose from for each course. Well, somehow, the wild mushroom ravioli appetizer got replaced with buffalo wings, and they also had a spinach artichoke dip available but they didn't tell us about it. I only found out when I said I wasn't going to order a first course because I don't eat meat, and the waiter mentioned offhand that they had the dip as an option as well. n nIt took probably about 45 minutes for the first course to arrive. Unbelievable. The salad course came not too long after the appetizers, but by this point we were all getting restless. We had four children under the age of four in our party, and the kitchen managed to bring food out for them right away to keep them calm. The portions for the kids were out of control they received giant dishes of chicken fingers, french fries, and a HUGE bowl of pasta primavera kids eat vegetables? that not even a large adult would be able to finish. Oh, and a note on the salad the menu stated that the ""mojo caesar salad "" came with molten gruyere croutons.but not a crouton was to be found on any caesar salad plate. n nBy the time the entree course arrived, no one was really even hungry anymore. My cousin the groom had ordered the Ahi tuna entree.and found it so tough that he sent it back and ordered a steak instead. Everyone was underwhelmed by their entrees. By this point, the wait staff seemed to have forgotten we existed and we were all in serious need of water refills. n nDesserts came, which were fine, but nothing to write home about. Not to mention that the groom's entree arrived just before the dessert, so he was eating his steak while we ate our sweets. We were all pretty pissed at this point. n nI REALLY, REALLY hope they gave my cousin and his wife a big discount on that meal, because it was horribly botched. Nothing about it was right. It was supposed to be a two hour affair, but it ended up going at least twice as long. When we left, we saw a long ass line of people waiting to get in. Why? The view, I suppose. I highly do not recommend going to this place with a big group for a big event. I suppose it COULD be ok for a dinner with your significant other, just don't order the tuna. I wouldn't bother waiting in line to get into this place, either. I hear there are other places in Vegas with great views and better service.",1
I spoke to the manager of the Encore Beach Club today who was very kind and has taken the necessary step to make sure future guests are treated with respect and dignity!,1
"I'm giving this place a good review mainly based on service and atmosphere. We have been here twice to watch games which is what this place is perfect for. It's big enough that you don't feel bad taking up a table for a whole game and the servers are totally cool with you staying until the end of the game we continue to buy drinks after we eat, so that probably helps . n nThe decor is really nice and it's a very comfortable restaurant. My concern is that it is SO big I'm not sure if they'll be able to stay in business because besides it being a really good place to watch a game, the food is just okay. n nI've had the Orange and Brew Beef sandwich just ok and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap good I'll probably get this again . Both came with the crinkle cut fries that another reviewer wrote about probably were frozen, but I enjoyed them . My husband had the pizza just ok and the BLT just ok . So, out of the four things we've tried, we'd probably only order one of them again. Not great. n nRegarding the beer selection yeah, it's not that exciting, but I think the name ""Orange and Brew "" is more of a tribute to the Illini than it is a reference to their beer selection. n nI would love to see this place re vamp their menu to be a little more interesting and maybe not so big maybe pick a theme? I think they're going to have trouble staying in business if they don't.",2
The sushi was alright. The service I received was horrible! I came here on Sunday night and I ran into a group of people very upset due to some issues they had inside and that probably should have been my first indicator to turn around. I walked in and the hostess looked and me didn't greet me and walked off to talk to a table she then came back and still did not acknowledge us I still was too bothered and thought maybe she's just really busy. We finally sat down and had to wait 15min for someone to come over to get our drink order. Once the waiter came over we also gave our food order because we didnt want to wait another 15min and that was the 1 and only time we saw our waiter I had to ask the hostess for the bill. The customer service here is nonexistent and I will never be back. I should have gone to Yama Sushi.,1

The money is just one thing, but more importantly this guy gets it. n nI had always meant to go into Espada, but I lived closer to another shop, and sometimes Espada seemed intimidating it's in downtown Noda, etc so I never did.

Its free and you can take pictures or videos. n nMind you, people will be selling light up crap there, flowers and other people will be dressed up as god knows what in that area too.

Very poor food quality. Veal tasted like cold boxed foods. This place use to be great but no longer. Good STAFF and great view. Go for a drink but avoid the food.,1
"It's never a good sign when you wait 15 minutes for a server to come to you.

"Below average in more than one category. nMassive steak portions. As one example the prime rib I believe is 34 oz, but you can't get a smaller size. Another example is the 26 oz. ribeye. It's kind of a ""Heart Attack Grill "" methodology for the portion sizes, except the HAG has beef that is really flavorful, unlike this place! I ended up getting the 8 oz petite filet since I didn't want to gorge.cooked exactly as I asked, but nothing remarkable to write home about. nAs an appetizer, I had the French onion soup. There was some annoying sweet taste in the soup, which overwhelmed any other flavor. The cheese topping the soup was tasteless. My friend had the colossal shrimp cocktail, and it was massive.only 2 shrimp, and at least the presentation gets an A . For 27, I would expect a lot from a shrimp cocktail! nFor prices, I believe the petite filet was 52, beers were 12, horseradish sauce 5, and the French onion soup was 14.with the Total Rewards card discount. n nService was very good, but you won't feel pampered here. n nOh Caesars, why did you ever replace Neros Steakhouse with this place?",1
"This place can get pretty busy and with the location it can be a slight bit of a challenge getting in and out of here but this place services a large population in the area so I can't blame them. n nI had to write this review specifically for one guy, Tony. n nI was trying to print out some business cards the other day and the printer went haywire. Even though Tony looked extremely busy he took a whole bunch of his time trouble shooting my file, trying different methods to print it and eventually giving me a lot of credit back due to the problems with my file and the business card papers I brought in. n nAnother thing that impressed me was all the customers coming in and saying hi to him and he knew most all of them by name. Service like that will make this my go to FedEx location. Thanks for your help Tony!",2
I believe this location has closed and should be removed as a listing,1
"I'm a Philly girl who is always on the hunt for a great cheese steak! You'd be surprised how hard it is to find a great sandwich, I mean is there really some great secret in Philly? I do have to first say that Corleone's is pretty pricey for just a sandwich and a drink if there are no specials. However, they definitely have the best cheesesteak in Phoenix. My search still continues but Corleone's is number one in my book so far.",2
"Not very good food with high prices. We were 6 people and the bill was 140.00 before the tip. No alcohol. One lady in our party has most of her stomach removed and can only eat certain foods. She ordered the thai beef salad, and asked to speak to the chef who happened to be one of the owners. She questioned the lady about her not wanting the beef, but plainly cooked shrimp, and no dressing. It was embarrasing for all of us to see our friend who handles her illness bravely, being grilled by the cook. When I checked the bill after leaving the restaurant, I found that they charged an extra 4.00 for the shrimp and no beef making this dish close to 13.00. We were also charged for another 9.00 dish that we didn't order. nI called the following day and spoke to the cook owner. She remembered us. I explained their error, and asked to have my credit card credited. She said she couldn't do that because it was after the fact. After some discussion, she relented and said that I could come in and get the money. I explained that because it was 30 minutes away, I would like her to mail a check to me. Well, after 4 weeks and 2 calls, no refund. All 6 people said, never again. nP.S. I received a 10.00 refund for their error and a 25.00 gift certificate two days after posting this.",1
"Papa's BBQ makes me so happy! I keep going back for more and more. There is something just so great about the taste of each individual item I've had so far here. The ribs are great, chicken is smoky and awesome, pork shoulder is amazing, tips are so awesome! Biscuits are the best in Madison! Fresh cooked wedges! Amazingly creamy cole slaw! Ahhhh I just can't stop! n nOk everyone.go to Papa Bears! Some of the best BBQ I have ever had. I wish I could give it a solid 6 stars.",2
Bought this on a groupon and boy am I hooked! This place has good food and a great variety. I would recommend you get the larger portion as its very cost effective. Samurai Sam's.I will return!,2
"How do you go to this place and not go for the salad? Well, I did. And I'm glad I did. Lots of protein for vegetarians vegans. lentils, beans, hard boiled eggs, chick peas, nuts, tofu. you get the idea. Chopping up mixing the salad was the healthy icing on this healthy cake. I enjoyed the Boylan Vintage Soda Pop, a nice refreshing change. I also checked out the kids menu, with more then one veggie option for my veggie kid PB J, grilled cheese and a little salad . Beware, it does get jammed packed so stay away from peak hours. I will, for sure, be back.",2
"Fast, Friendly, and honest nI highly recommend Rx Garage Door. The man that fixed our garage was knowledgable, very thorough, and upfront about the cost and job to be done. He even adjusted our 2nd garage door at no extra cost. nI was able to pay with my credit card and got a copy of the invoice emailed to me promptly. A company!",2
"I will never stay there again. n nI went to Vegas for one of my birthdays. It was my first trip to Vegas, I drove from LA and was rather tired. I booked a room beforehand, and wanted a nice one, so I have paid online for the upgrade to a Strip View room. n nWhat a disappointment it was for me when I have seen that the ""Strip view "" was a view of that part of Strip where nothing was built it was a few years back . The room itself was OK, just a hotel room. n nWhen I went down to talk to a receptionist that I really wanted a Strip view with some view, not empty roads, and not a partial Strip view , and it was my birthday, the receptionist looked at me like I had a disease or something and said nothing. Really, he did not say anything, not I apologize, not an even attempt to make me feel better. So, I was stuck in this room with an ugly view of a desert having paid for it a higher price. n nCould I talk to a manager? Yes, perhaps, but this is the last thing you wanna do when you are in town for two days and want to have fun celebrating your birthday. It already sucked to be there all by myself. And New York New York did not help. n nI guess it might be selective treatment regular mortal people who don't rent penthouses don't count. n nI was very unhappy about the hotel staff behavior.",1
"If you like delicious food, then more delicious food packed into convenient burrito packaging, you love Jamburritos. The blackened catfish burrito and all the catfish is ridiculously great. 2 grown adults can easily fatface on a single burrito. K Sadillas are fantastic as well.

"WHAT A JOKE! probably one of the worst burgers I have ever had! do yourself a favor go across the street to A.J's Fine Foods and get a real grilled burger from Rick the BBQ chef at the outdoor grille! the burger was dry from Burger Fi! I am not a stranger to real 100 beef, my family was born and raised here in AZ and we OWN a Black Angus Registered Cattle Ranch, we raise pure natural grass fed beef and sell it at Farmers Markets across the valley. I called in an order and told the girl to go ahead and put it in she said OK and it would be ready in 10 15 min. WRONG! nmy wife was stopping by to pick it up and waited to the point she went across the Street to AJ's and picked up her salad and came back to get my sorry excuse for a burger and soggy fries, she still waited 15 minutes. VERY EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED also shocked at the price for a burger fries and a kids cup sized drink. 15.09 INSANE! i could have gone to the KEG and got Prime Rib sliders for 13.00 and saved a few bucks.",1
"Not impressed.I was in Scottsdale for a few days on business and decided to get a relaxing pedicure in my free time. After reading the reviews I decided to try Pro Nails by Julie. When I called to make an appt I specifically asked for Julie since she is the one mentioned in most of the reviews. The place is clean and they do have a nice selection of colors. I sat down in the chair and was given a bottle of water which is a nice touch but when it came to the cuticle clipping and filing it was awful. She hardly clipped my cuticles at all and she filed my toenails crooked and they were all different lengths! This is Julie, the owner? I live in Southern CA and you can go to any nail shop and get a better job for a much better price. I paid 33 for basically a polish change and a little lotion on my legs and the massage that other Yelpers reviewed about being so good? ummm not so much.I really wish Bliss wasnt booked solid I would have gladly paid an extra 20 for a good job.",1
"My friend from work tried this place first, and recommended it to me because they have low prices, large drinks, good food, and everything tasted delicious! n nSo. n nToday was the first time I visited this place, and they were really nice to me, so I decided to make a yelp account and write a review for them.

"Quite ""meh. "" The service was good, but the food was decidedly average. My Cuban sandwich was just missing something. I don't know if it needed more pickle, more cheese, or better bread, but it was just bland. I finished my lunch, but I won't be making a special effort to come back.",1
"The Pakistani food is great. has that great home cooked taste to it.we tried the daal, gosht karahi, chicken pulao, chaana puri and veggie thali. it was amazing the service is great and food is well priced. Definitely made my last day in ARizona a happy one",2

"Adam took me to ""a different point of view "" to celebrate my birthday. Super nice. Beautiful view. n nWe get there and there are about 3 weddings going on. Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. ""Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby "" That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored. n nWe were lead to our table which was not a window view as Adam requested . We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit. n nAfter a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom. n nWe were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good. n nAfter dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied ""we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. "". n nThey knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten. n nTook 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check. n nHorrible experience for such a special occasion.",1
the worst of the self serve fro yo places I've been to. nOver half of the yogurt machines were empty. nthe topping selection was tiny compared to other places. nThere was not a clean table to be found. nThe girl behind the counter looked bored out of her mind. n nWe won't be returning here.,1
"The ""everyone in the group must order at least one drink "" rule is ridiculous. I was with a group of 4 friends just finished dinner and 2 of us wanted bubble tea so we went in and sat down. Me and someone ordered bubble tea. 2 of my friends asked if they can have hot water. The waitress downright said ""NO ""and then proceeded to give us attitude the whole time. we then decided to just get our drinks to go, we paid and that waitress slammed our money down in the back counter and walked away while we were still sitting in our seat a considerable amount of distance away. The actual bubble tea was not bad wouldn't be surprised if they had spat in it . but either way, because of the deliberate rudeness of the staff I would skip this place.",1
"The two stars for Verde is for its food. I'd give it three stars for its drinks. This is my second time eating at Verde and the food just doesn't hold up. Tonight I ordered two appetizers for my meal. The Mexican chicken wings and the fried brussel sprouts. I had to send back the brussel sprouts because they were burnt and tasted as such. I replaced this dish with the fingerling potatoes which came out overdone. The flavors didn't mesh at all. I don't know what happened to the caramelized onion puree, but what stood prominent were the chewy potatoes with a very saturated smokey taste of chorizo. n nI'm such a fan of chicken wings and was really looking forward to these because I also love chimichurri. I was also disappointed with this dish. The wings were overdone and very dry and were dipped in tasteless chimichurri sauce. You eat with your eyes first. The inattentive presentation of both dishes also dampened my dining experience. n nThe dining room is nice and the noise level was average and didn't interfere with normal conversation. I definitely will not come back for food. I was tempted to order the tacos, but when I took a peek at the tacos brought to the table next to me, they looked really small and not worth the price. I'll only come back for a cocktail.",1
I went into Freddies After my workout at LVAC because I saw a sign that said they had new internet prices well I can tell you that their prices are not internet prices they are quite higher their selection is poor compared to the other stores in town and their prices are higher .Overall I was not very impressed at all .I will not be coming Back!,1
"This place used to be one of my favorites! But guess what? I was one of the lucky ones who got food poisoning. Obviously, I will never go back to this place or their sister restaurants, the way I felt for a week is not worth the risk. I was there with a friend and we had their sparkling sangria, rib eye steak with fries, stuffed dates, apple and manchego salad and mussels with chorizo. Their service was great and their food taste as their usual, but unfortunately one day later I ended up getting salmonella. I was at a volunteer event when my symptoms started, I actually had to leave the place and go home because I could not even walk straight. The diarrhea started when I got home and then the abdominal cramping came, it was as if I were a girl in my period. Gals, I know what you go through and I feel ya! I wish I could recommend this place, but my advice is EAT THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!",1
"By far one of the best places to get a burger in the Burgh area. I've tried four of the six patties on the custom patties section, with different combinations of toppings buns rubs and cannot find a thing wrong with anything. Get a burger with fries or decide to opt out of the fries and get a mix of potato chips made from russet and sweat potatoes. One cannot describe what can be said of the shakes, who knew that ice cream mixed with such a combination as smores could bring back memories of a childhood campfire? The atmosphere of this location is great, especially in the summertime when you can sit anywhere in the restaurant and feel the breeze coming in from outside. The staff is amazing and right on point. If you show up at a busy time, instead of getting one of those annoying coaster like devises that could be used as a weapon, they can text you when your table is ready. All in all, it's worth the trip.",2
"First time here and I have to say I enjoyed everything it was soooo amazing! I had about five of their tapas all very good, simbal wings full of flavor not too spicy, salmon carpaccio light fresh and delicious, lamb lollipops soooo unexplainably good. I don't know what more I can say everything blew my mind nothing close to what I was expecting!",2
"Went here to have my nails done. First of all, I can't tell if they even grasp what I want because they can't speak very good English, and mostly respond with ""yeah, yeah,yeah "". Next I come here and I'm the only customer. I get the one named hy who obviously has poor artistic skills. I wouldn't have this guy pain the side of my house! I ended up with a nail polish job that looked like a 4 yr old did it when they were drunk. I complained to the guy while he was doing it, and his solution was to add more coats of polish! My nails ended up looking like I dipped my fingers in pink hot wax. I told three employees i hated it but got nowhere. Finally I paid and hy had the gall to ask if I wanted to add a tip. I walked out, but just couldn't accept the shoddy work and went back in. Henry got attitude and abruptly told me to sit down and wait my turn now 8 people waiting to have them fixed. Totally disappointed, spent almost 3 hours on that should have only taken an hour at the most! I'm irritated with oriental attitude!",1
"I visited Cafe El Dorado because I didn't want to wait for the ridiculously long line at the infamous L'Avenue across the road. As I've never heard of this brunch place before, I didn't have any expectations going in. n nI had brunch at Cafe El Dorado, and the quality of the food itself was average. The portions were decent for the standard brunch prices. n nThe service was a disappointment. It took at least 20 minutes just to get the order down, and the food time a very long time to show up. The waiters and waitresses weren't particularly friendly either, but at the same time they didn't do anything terribly bad. n nI wouldn't visit here again, since there are better places just down the road just walk along Ave Du Mont Royal and you'll find something .",1
"I highly recommend Venue at the Grove for your wedding ceremony and reception! Not only are they professional, but they are also responsive! They will work with you throughout the entire wedding planning process. The owners are an amazing couple and have hired the right people to help manage their business. Their current coordinator Taylor is absolutely amazing. She went above and beyond on our wedding day to help ensure things went smoothly. We were married on September 27th during a severe monsoon thunderstorm. Taylor, the set up crew, and even Edward one of the owners , worked so hard to help set up our outdoor wedding yes it was outside during a thunderstorm rain and all! Thank you again Venue at the Grove. We truly appreciate all of your hard work to help make our wedding day special and functional! lol",2
"Customer Service FAIL I called ahead EXPLICITLY to request 2 queen bed. When I arrived, I was told that was not possible with no more availability, and I should've called ahead. n nRenovation FAIL The bathroom that we had has no tub, but an open Euro Gym style shower area, which is fine. Only if that area is not built higher than the rest of the bathroom floor. Every time we shower, we get an instant flood in the bathroom.",1
"Good fast friendly service ,food was better than most airport food and a bar with top shelf liquor not the normal overpriced rail drinks and much better than a sports bar nobody needs buffalo wings before getting on a plane!",2
This is one of the best thrift stores around. It's really clean and organized. All the racks a SIZED and and sectioned into categories. nI like that all the prices are consistent and everything is in pretty good condition. Nothing I have ever found was over priced. It is what it is. nMy best find was a pink Betsy Johnson coat for 6.00! nIt's almost like shopping at a dept store it's so nice and tidy. n nMy only compliant is that the fitting rooms can be kind of stinky.,2
"Wow, how disappointing and sort of sad. I live on the opposite side of town, so have not visited here often, but it sure has emptied out. nI had some shopping to do, but this plaza has been hit hard by the economy because a lot of the store fronts were empty. The stores that I do normally have luck in were not very large and I would be able to get more selection at Town Square. Except for having an excuse to eat at Settebello delicious as always , I can't see bothering to visit again.",1
"Serviceable ""upscale "" chain seafood spot, with both traditional dishes and sushi. Yes, it's expensive, but it's one of the few spots open late downtown. The sashimi was pleasant, and it's hard to screw up oysters and seafood pasta. Our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations. n nThe service is on par with your local crap on the wall chain restaurant, so don't expect too much.",1
"It's been a very long time since I was as pleasantly surprised with a dinner as I was with Savor. When we left Arkansas for Virginia, we stopped in Charlotte for a few days to visit with our families. One night while we were home, my in laws took us out to dinner. They suggested Savor. I had never heard of it, but a quick glance at their menu online had my interest piqued. n nThe restaurant is small, and it didn't help that half of the dining area was occupied with a rehearsal dinner. Luckily there was one table available. Once we were seated, our adorable waiter took drink orders. He was seriously adorable. Pretty eyes, pretty smile, nice arms in his tight black shirt. n n ahem n nAnyways. They had a nice selection of local beers, which is apparently the hot thing these days. I'm not a beer drinker, so I ordered a cocktail, the 'Southern Special Tea'. It was a concoction of Firefly Sweet Tea Vodka, Southern Comfort, iced tea and freshly squeezed lemonade. It was absolutely delicious and the southern girl in me appreciates anything served out of a mason jar. n nTheir menu was small, but impressive. It was difficult to choose a dish. Graham and his mom both ordered the meatloaf. My father in law ordered one of their specials a rib eye and I finally decided on the Cowboy Pork Chop over Country Ham Succotash Risotto. n nOh. My. God. This was absolutely phenomenal. The pork chop was tender and had amazing flavor, and the risotto was probably the best risotto I have ever, ever had. The flavor was phenomenal and I wanted about ten more plates of it to take home with me. The risotto is DEFINITELY something I'm going to have to recreate at home! n nThe meatloaf that Graham and his mom ordered was just as fantastic. The portions were huge! The meatloaf was grilled and served with a tangy pepper relish and served with horseradish mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. Everything on that plate was delicious. The potatoes just had the hint of horseradish, and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. They still had a bite to them, and were well seasoned. But the meatloaf. oh man. Probably the best meatloaf I've ever had. It was so moist and flavorful. n nWe were stuffed after finishing our meals, but having stared at their dessert menu all night made ordering something sweet a definite. Graham and I decided to split an order of the butterscotch bread pudding. n nI've never been a huge fan of bread pudding, but this was epic. The portion for this, like the rest of our food, was huge but I'm not embarrassed to say that we finished it all. The texture of this was amazing, and the flavors all worked so well together. We were generous and let the rest of our party have a bite, and they were equally impressed. n nThis was a fantastic dinner, at a great, hidden spot in Charlotte. The West Side has never really been known for fine dining, but I'm happy to see that's starting to change. Our experience at Savor was wonderful. The food was amazing, the service was fantastic, and the portion sizes for the amount of money we spent was just awesome. I mean, that massive plate of meatloaf and sides that Graham ordered was 11.50! Crazytown!",2
"Great ice cream. I had the candy corn on a waffle cone and it was delicious. It was only one scoop but they were very generous with their amount. It almost felt like two scoops. I went with a friend and he got three scoops and couldn't finish it haha. So I absolutely love that they're generous with their servings unlike most ice cream shops. n nHowever, they do have a limited amount of flavors I think there were around 12 instead of the usual 24. The prices are also the same as they would be at coldstone or other ice cream places, so their generous portions are wonderful and worth the price. n nThey also don't have a lot of seating unfortunately. They had literally four chairs outside. Luckily it wasn't busy when we were there so we grabbed the last two. They need a bigger shop!",2
"I thought this was pretty dope. I wasn't sure what to expect initially. I did score some discount tickets at the half price thing at the Coca Cola place. I am not a big museum kind of guy but the exhibit was the most interactive museum I have ever been to. You really know how these guys lived at the time. They have all kinds of stuff you can look at, cars, clothes, and other personal stuff that these mobsters owned. One of my biggest gripes was that you can't take photos. I was kind of irked about it, but I eventually got over it. You should check it out.",2
"I am waaaay too old for O'Sheas. nWe wound up here on Saturday night. Started out at Nine Fine Irishmen, in New York New York, and of course my husband befriended a group of youngsters from Wisconsin. Having already consumed two Seven and Sevens and 2 or 3 Magners on an empty stomach, I was not in a position to give an opinion. I gamely followed the group to the other end of the Strip. nDirty? Yeah, but I like dive bars. Problem is, this has more of a frat boy feel to it. My old man happens to be a beer pong champ, so he was in heaven. I don't gamble I know, lame , so I spent the next 5 hours drinking while he ruled the bp table. nMost of the night was a blur. Found out later that I had texted him about someone grabbing my crotch. I have no recollection of that perhaps it was the leprechaun that I read about in other reviews? I do recall telling a hippie how lame high fiving is, and sexually harassing a young Irish lad who made the mistake of flirting with me. nWas dragged back to our hotel room at 2 30, where I draped myself over the white house and refunded all of my drinks. An appropriate ending for a skanky evening. nWhy 2 stars instead of 1? I can appreciate the low prices and the novelty of beer pong in a casino.",1
"I really adore this place mostly for their lunch special, and their guac is a particular favorite of mine since it's how my mom always makes it nTheir portions are always large so you really get your money's worth. Sometimes the food can be a little bland, but I feel like that's more a failing on my part for not putting the right salsa on whatever I'm getting. n nTheir sweet green salsa and mango salsa are particular favorites of mine, and I'm happy to keep going back to a local business.",2
"If your like me, you've lost 20 in a very short amount of time in one of the casinos only to walk out frustrated and mad asking yourself ""What did I get out of that "". However I have walked into PHOF and played the same game for a few hours on 50 cents! n nArcades are a lost form because of home video game systems, well it's hard to keep up with the rising costs of this new technology and having to have all the accessories and what not. Pinball is simple and the best part is, if you are really good, you only get a ""Game Over "" when you drain the ball, not when you beat the game. n nThey also have more than just pinball, my friends and I play this game where you use two lifts to guide a ball into a lighted hole without going into one of the dark holes. They also have bubble boys hockey and a few video games Tetris, Mario, Pac Man, etc. n nAnother plus is all the profits are donated to charity, in the past few years they have written close to 1 million to the salvation army. Another highlight is the 25 cent popcorn machine and a soda vending machine which has almost everything Coke Pepsi products with all the special flavors . n nI think this is a great cheap date spot and you can get a lot more entertainment here than you would on a video poker machine!",2
"I've been trying to explore Summerlin now as it is my new territory while I'm at work. Since I haven't had Vietnamese in awhile, I decided to try this little place since it's around the corner from my job. n nI usually get the cold rice vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and an egg roll pretty straightforward and really, really hard to botch. n nWell, it was pretty much botched. n nThe only reason this place gets any kind of stars is their grilled pork is to DIE for. Now why would I only give it two stars? You get about two pieces for your ENTIRE bowl. And not like, LARGE pieces normal sized bowl pieces. Everything else is mediocre vermicelli, some carrots and bean sprouts, and an OBNOXIOUS amount of lettuce. n nStill hoping for the best, I tried the egg roll. Last time I checked, egg rolls shouldn't be rubbery. How does that happen? I really don't know. n nFish sauce was not on par, it tasted like it was old. In fact, everything but the pork tasted old. and I got this around lunchtime. Eck. n nVery tiny inside and I had to ask 3 times to get some hoisin sauce. I tried getting sriracha as well but I guess there was a communication snafu. The lady was friendly. n nStill shopping around for a good Vietnamese place in Summerlin.",1
LOOOOVE this place! The sauces are absolutely amazing also. the food is awesome! deffintly coming back!,2
I love this place. Atmosphere and their ridiculously pricey drinks. food is great and it is a fun place to come with friends and grab drinks and be social.,2
"Warning number one let me start this review by saying beware all those from the East side this is not the same as Kabuki in Tempe. n nOur experience at Kabuki was disappointing to me, especially after I chose the restaurant based on Yelp reviews. n nSeating was prompt and pleasant for our party of five. It was an early meal, and the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. Our waiter had his hands full, and, to his credit, we were a table of 3 sushi amateurs and 2 sushi snobs all vying for his attention. Despite this bonus credit, he was very ""first day on the job. "" n nWe ordered a few apps, including the gyoza and misos. The gyoza was well received and the misos were standard issue. n nNext on to the courses, the timing of which was horrible. We made it very clear to the waiter that two of us would be having sushi as our main, and the rest would be having entrees. Unfortunately, this was completely disregarded resulting in a gap so large that the person with the first entree served was nearly finished when the last entree arrived. Not sure if this was a wait staff or kitchen issue, either way it was problematic and a HUGE peeve of mine. n nIn the midst of all this the specialty rolls we ordered, the Hawaiian and the Caterpillar, were served along with the eel, salmon roe and tuna rolls. The straight sushi was very good the tuna was fresh, the roe not fishy. The eel was a bit drier than what I would prefer, but the flavor was spot on not cloyingly sweet or over sauced. n nUnfortunately, the specialty rolls were so vile I actually had to be ""that "" person and send them back. It was a shame, as they looked stunning and were very generous portions. But . this brings us to warning number two Crabmeat on their menu actually means Krab meat as in the imitation stuff, and not just in the California roll where we all expect it and I can avoid it . It seems to make an appearance in ALL of their specialty rolls complete with mayo. Yuck. n nNow, I realize every place has their own spin, but frankly I found the whole thing to be appalling I've never seen a Caterpillar roll that includes Krab. And the Hawaiian just made sense to have real crab, given the other ingredients. n nThe hostess or manager, not sure who she was but nonetheless lending a hand, was very gracious in accommodating a prompt removal of these sushi abortions and supplying additional tuna and spicy tuna rolls which were both VERY good . I give major points to them for handling the situation well. n nWhile I was very disappointed with my experience, it wasn't all bad. Had we not had the service issues, I likely would not have sent the sushi back, but by that point I was already getting a bit on edge. So, I won't trash the place, because god knows there aren't enough independents on that side of town, and the items done well particularly the spicy tuna and teriyaki were very good. So my advice if you're not of the Krab loving persuasion stick to the basics, and you'll do alright.",1
"If I could give 5 I'd. The most horrible place I've ever been. Ordered food and waited for an hour and no sign of drinks or food. Eventually, left the place late at night hungry after waiting for an hour!",1
"I decided to try this place on a quick pit stop while running errands before heading to work, and did so based on what some others here said. The burgers are good, however when the cook slapped mine on the flattop before moving it to the grill I wasn't really impressed. Lost a point with that one, dude, really. n nFries as a side were good, but they do something particular to their gravy which leaves an aftertaste . a little overpowering and kills other flavors. n nOverall good eats, good prices, but a cut below Miteras' burger and fries.",2
"Handicap Accessible CONCERNS. n nWe booked 2 rooms, 1 being handicap accessible. nCONS n1. Room was in the middle of a long hallway corridor. n2. Room fair walking distance from the parking lot n3. A C quit working in the at Midnight, service personnel arrived at 2AM, was able to get fan working but was not until 3AM. n4. Addressed issues with staff at checkout and refused eye contact said they'd look into with ""no apology "" n nPRO n1. Shower was a walk in n nBoth rooms were nice set ups modern appointments. The 2nd room booked was fine. However my biggest concern is anyone with handicap issues is vulnerable and with the hotel not addressing maintenance issues timely, makes me rethink for next time. Plus the hotel is not the best appointed for Handicap accessibility. My rooms were for family who had 'walking issues' with canes, definitely a too long of walk for them.",1
"After midnight on a wednesday, a rare miracle occurred and my boyfriend agreed to indulge my noodle soup craving! After we shared a lackluster pho experience in Seattle, he's always resisted any mention of brothy noodles. n nUpon arriving, the restaurant had several occupied tables. My order was promptly handled and I was offered a complimentary hot tea while I waited. The tea was steaming when it came out, but had the tiny residuals of ice floating in it a considerate touch since I wouldn't be staying long enough for the tea to cool in the glass on it's own. I enjoyed the tea, it was flavorful, very refreshing and a nice precursor to the meal. I ordered the 10 for myself and the 12 for the boy. My meal came with gelatinous chunks of meat, shredded tripe, brisket and rare steak as well as chopped green onion and raw onion. I really enjoyed the textural variety that the different meats contributed to the meal the shredded tripe was something I found surprisingly pleasing. The only negative is that the gelatinous pieces were so rich, I doubt I'd be able to have this same dish too often. His had a lot of shredded brisket and some rare steak, as well as the green and raw onion. The noodles and toppings came in a container to themselves, with the broth and additional raw vegetables in separate packages. The vegetables were a huge portion tons of bean sprouts, lots of fresh herbs basil and others that I didn't recognize and chopped jalapeno and lime quarters. There were also several containers of sauce. It was all wrapped up well and stayed hot during the cross town drive home. I appreciated that the steak was pretty much raw when I got it, so that we could pour the hot broth over it and let it cook in the soup. The meat is more tender that way. The broth had a nice spice level without being obnoxious, was just salty enough and worked really well with a fresh squeeze of lime on top. n nIn fact, the broth was flavorful enough that J finished most of his which is exceedingly rare to see. Early into the bowl he said that he'd be willing to have their pho again, so I am VERY happy! More noodle soups for me! Pho so 1 has converted a pho phobe. And the generous portion of vegetables and different herbs makes it feel virtuous enough to have instead of burritos, so I can justify eating here again soon. The hours are perfect for me as I often work pretty late. I chose this place because they aren't open 24 hours I just can't help but think maybe their chefs are happier or something. n nTheir iced coffee with condensed milk is strong and has a unique taste to it. It reminded me of custard with a strong coffee punch. When I recieved my order, the server laughed and asked if I was going to be partying all night. The cup had a lot of ice and the actual amount of coffee ended up being rather small, but that's probably a good thing considering the time of night I was having it. n nYay, Pho So 1, you are 1 Pho sho!",2
Great italian food! The antipasto is a perfect starter and the linguine with clams is delicious! Favorite local spot.,2
"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Even when crowded, the wait is never too long. The food is really good and the wait staff are always very attentive and food arrives promptly. We feel that it can be a little pricey, so not a real bargain, but consistently good.",2
"As a US Air guy with status I was expecting a lot more from this airport after not having visited for eight years. It's not a dump but compared to the other US Air hub, Charlotte, it's a dump. n nThe food is meh, the terminal layout is meh. n nIt's easy to get to from downtown and Scottsdale which is a plus. n nThe rental car facility requires a bus transfer but it's pretty quick. n nMaybe there's magic in terminals one and two but three and four are horribly average with minimal places to plug in electronics and the bathrooms are straight from 1981. bleh",1
"We had 3 ruby players cards for our family of 5 adults and my son and for my son they wouldn't do the discount of 5. We told the cashier and she wouldn't do it. The service was average. n nThe food was good but not excellent. I liked the shrimp, crab, and other foods but their fruit was unripe. n nThe price was reasonable for its food which I liked. Each adult is 21.99. kids older than 8 are full price ",1
Boris was great and fixed my refrigerator defroster problem. He was very professional. The parts came in very fast within 4 days. I am very pleased with the company.,2
"We can't stop in to Southwest Gardener without discovering something completely new and enticing so naturally we couldn't wait to check out their new location. What's not to like? There seems to be oodles more room for even more delightfully artistic goodies.some for the garden and some for the home. Our house has been touched by a number of handcrafted pieces we found at this unique and special store. Then when we need the most perfect gift, one of the two women owners, Amy or Lynn, are always right there with the perfect suggestions and wrapping. Finally.when they have a sale we watch for them THEY HAVE A GREAT SALE! That's when we really stock up on gift items. This is such a cool place that we make a point to take our out of town guests on a field trip to Southwest Gardener. Now that they are in the Newton with Changing Hands Bookstore another fave of ours and Southern Rail absolutely yummy we couldn't be happier!",2
This is now me and my boyfriends place for breakfast. I'm a little confused with some of the negative posts on here as we thought it was seriously the best breakfast we have ever had! We walked in and the place was so cute! Our waiter was super nice. There was such a good variety of food and had things that were different than all the other breakfast places so we couldn't decide what to get so we ordered a ton of stuff and shared it all lol. The caramelized banana pecan French toast was delish!,2
"So, I literally just reviewed 5th and Wine, the Scottsdale place owned by the same proprietors that own this wine bar bistro in Chandler, which makes me a feel a bit repetitive since the menus are pretty much identical, but I'll give you the Cliff Notes version of the food and drink review and then move on to what's unique about this place. n nFood n Bruschetta toppings are really solid but bread is a bit soft n Vegetable salad is really fresh but could use better lettuce n Tuna panini was really good and quite large for the price n nDrink n Bloody Mary Martini with jalapeno vodka and fresh mozzarella garnish is where it's at n The glass of Albarino 5 during happy hour was really crisp and good n nWhat makes the Living Room different is that it's much more of a swanky loungey feel, while the 5th and Wine spot feels a bit more cafe like. Also, the outdoor area of the Living Room is super comfortable, with big couches to lounge on, a sweet fireplace, and a lovely breeze if you're lucky enough to be there in March, like I was! . Our server was also decidedly less formal than the one at 5th and Wine but still very on top of it. n nI would definitely not drive back to South Chandler to go to this place, but I would certainly do so if I lived closer.",2
Food was not tasty. Either too salty or too sweet. Soup was not good. Here for a birthday party which was ruined due to server dropping calamari on the birthday girls and guests. Service was terribly slow. Desert was ok but selection was not. Would not come again.,1
"We used a Groupon and ordered the 1 4 rack of beef ribs and a pulled pork sammie with potato salad. I have to say this was one of the best meals we have ever had! Great service, great BBQ sauce we'll be back!",2
"Terrible service, no class, could not handle our party of 20 people. They never brought people's food out, messed up orders, and did zero accommodations for their mess ups. Worst Hooters I've ever been to in 10 years!",1
"It's rare that I take the time to write a review but my experience here was so bad I felt compelled to alert anyone who is considering dining here. n nMy husband and I had a night out and were looking forward to good food and conversation we had spotted this seafood restaurant and thought we would give it a try. We went in and immediately it was clear that we just seated ourselves. Then a friendly waiter came by and took our drink order. However, it was at least 15 minutes until the drinks returned. n nLooking over the menu, we quickly realized that it was more expensive than anticipated most dishes running between 15.00 30.00 nBut we rationalized that it's worth paying the difference for quality seafood. So, we placed our orders. n nWhen the food came out and we glimpsed the plates immediately we were concerned. The presentation was awful and the portions small. My meal consisted of overcooked Talipia, with a small, sad pile of potatoes and coleslaw. I don't consider myself much of a cook but I can tell you that I've made far better fish and potatoes at home. My husband took one bite of his shrimp and pushed the plate away. His shrrimp, also overcooked, was completely unappealing and repulsive. n nWe discussed the situation and both decided the last thing we wanted to do was spend roughly 70.00 on a horrible meal. We agreed that we'd had far better at Red Lobster. The price rivaled one of my favorite seafood restaurants The Chart House where I can guarantee you, you won't be disappointed . n nWe flagged the waiter and asked him to remove the meals from our ticket and that we'd go elsewhere for dinner. Something my husband and I had never, ever done before. n The one good thing I can say, is that both the waiter and the Manager who came by were very apologetic and accomodating. They were the one bright spot in a truly awful experience.",1
"If you are going to Hash House A Go Go, I would definitely recommend going to this location. The overall decor dining experience is much nicer. n nAs for the food, better come hungry because the portion sizes are huge! Everyone raves about the sage chicken waffles, as they should because it is phenomenal. I usually get the waffles with glazed bananas pecans on top and it is one of the most delicious breakfast meals I've had to date. Also, their drinks are just as tasty. I'm a big fan of Bloody Mary's and the BLT Bloody Mary doesn't disappoint. Hot chocolate is great too! n nOverall, I would say if you are looking for a hearty, delicious breakfast Hash House is a great place to go.",2
"Prices are amazing, pastries all look good. The one I had was amazing, it was a spinache cheese pastry. Service is a lil off. But not bad. I will be coming back",2
"I noticed this place getting good reviews on Yelp and decided to try them out yesterday for lunch. n nI had the Long Trail which is roast beef on sourdough with a bunch of other stuff in it. The sandwich was huge and tasted great. Next time I think I'll ask them to toast the bread which, for me, would make it better. n nThey have a nice patio outside in front which is great now that the weather is getting nice. n nAll their sandwiches look good and I'll be back to try a few more.",2
"Call me crazy, but I'm OVER buffets. We came here because Golden Gate is gross and this was the next closest thing. n nI got the Famous meatloaf hash something or other. It was really good. A lot of food! My fiance though. He got the chicken and waffels. Not only was it beautiful when it came out it was just so decorated. It was possibly the best tasting thing I've ever had. It's more than enough food for 2 people. I cant recommend it enough.",2
"Good times, good people, great food, good beers.",2
"great service. very good unusual food. the food has origins from Japanese street food. nthe tofu steak with Japanese mint pineapple, praline was excellent. Liked the house made pickled root veggies. many other choices that looked good.good veggie restaurant nthe dessert we has was the dougnuts made with added tofu, rolled in rosemary sugar, top with sweet potato nsauce. .",2
"I spend entire paychecks here. Is this bad? nI find myself here very rarely, only because I know how grab happy I get here. nHOW CAN I RESIST, though? Their produce is amazing, and a great value considering the quality. Oh, and their bottled juices teas, ugh. love. n nTheir customer service is on point every single time and I just love how you get everything you need in one swift stop, without scouring hundreds of aisles like you do in, say, Walmart? n nAlso, I can't help but brag to all my family in Hawaii about how close this location is to me. Ha ha ha. n nThis is where I stop first before taking a trip back to the islands. Bringing a shipping box full of Trader Joe's to Hawaii is like. Santa Clause and his bag of goodies.",2
"For me Sundays are the hardest nights to decide where to go after 2 days of debauchery. It's a dilemma really, you want to party hard cause its the last night in Sin City, but you also want to keep it low key due to the check out at 11a the next day and trip back home. Upon recommendation from a promoter friend of my mine, we decided to go to Lavo. So we visited the Club just this past Sunday as a sort of final hurrah after a crazy weekend. So here's a what I took from my visit n n1 Alcohol and Stairs don't mix. Whoever decided to put sooo many stairs between the entrance to the upper level club wasn't thinking of what kind of issues drunk people would have going down those few flights of steps. I wasn't even drunk and I slipped and fell down a flight of steps I could only imagine how funny my tumble musta looked what more with someone drunk off their ass. n n2 The club is really small, I know its Restaurant first, then club second, but this place was really tiny. n n3 DJ Vice was killin it Sun Night. Probably had the best music playlist out of all the clubs we went to over the weekend. n n4 The girls got free open bar wrist bands 'til midnight. Coupled with the complementary drink coupons I got for us guys, we pretty much drank for free all night. n nOverall I found Lavo to be a great club to head to for either a night where everyone isn't trying to party to hard, or a spot to head to after a partying somewhere else. I finally found my Sunday destination next time I'm in Vegas",2
"A special someone was kind enough to treat me to dinner at this fine establishment one night. I can say with confidence that this restaurant is in my top 3 among Pittsburgh area restaurants that I have been to. First off, the overall decor and layout of this place is unique. From the open kitchen to the lavish bar both of which flank communal tables, this place is definitely not run of the mill. We were lucky enough to be seated upstairs where the overall environment is a bit more chill. One thing that I can't seem to get over is the fact that there are no printed menus the food options are listed on chalkboards! Even more, I'm told that the menu changes periodically to reflect the crops that are in harvest during any given point in the season. Very hippie in my mind, but cool nonetheless. n nAs soon as we sat down we were greeted by a friendly server who told us the specials of the day, albeit in a manner that was quite elaborate and gave me this sort of ""wow this place is fancy "" kind of vibe. We started of our meal with specialty cocktails which were both fantastic. For our entree I had the vegetable pasta, and she had the salmon. Both of which were wonderfully decorative in their appearance and quite exquisite in their taste. We finished out meal with this chocolate mousse cooked with pie crust sounds so weird, but it tasted fantastic. n nThe meal was definitely pricey, but very much worth it. This is a unique place that everyone should try at least once. Highly recommended.",2
"If you want to get out of the city and go to a bar from a small town, here it is. I like it right near the capitol.",2
"pros food is great, generous portions, unique cucumber ranch dressing. ncons very long wait, TERRIBLE service. I have been here twice and service was bad both times I came. We sat there for 15 minutes before our server came by to greet us. Bad attitude, food takes forever, the only thing that came back fast was the check in the end. Never again.",1
"My friend and I recently visited a friend in Scottsdale and we all scored Groupon tix for the DBG for 9 which makes it WELL worth it. n nWe really had a nice time walking around and chatting and enjoying the scenery. I've got a weakness for flower photos, so I was digging on the Wildflower path the most. There was a butterfly exhibit, but from previous experience I feel strongly that they are gigantic insects with pretty wings, so I stayed away. We did see smaller butterflies along the paths, though, as well as hummingbirds. n nBummed that the website lists the Chihuly exhibit on the main page, yet it ended in 2009. Luckily, I saw most of it when it was in Boston last year, but it turns out there are a few pieces near the entrance. n nIt was a beautiful day in a beautiful place. If you're in the area, I highly recommend it!",2
"I have never had the urge to eat here but my friends didn't want to wait in line for food, so we ended up here because they had no wait. It is good as a bar environment, if you want a bustling atmosphere where you can cheer for your favorite sports team, watch some people attempt to ride the mechanical bull, get drunk and eat a bit of appetizers. Don't come here if you are looking forward to a super appetizing meal. It is essentially just bar food that is served. I ate the Chili Cheese Taters and the PBR Burger. The food is heavy and there is nothing special about it. Most of our stomachs felt unsettled after eating here. Additionally, our waitress was grumpy and didn't do much to ensure we were having a good experience. I would rather eat elsewhere but if I were into sports I would probably go back for drinks during a game.",1
" ""Yelp fail! "" Everyone at my table n nUnfortunately, my family's experience at Casa Don Juan was not the greatest. While the free chips, salsa and bean dip were great it's kind hard to screw that up , the food we paid for was not very good. n nI ordered an a la carte Al Pastor Taco and the Pork and Red Sauce Tamale. The taco was, truly, the worst taco I've ever had. EVER. My mother, who also ordered the same taco, spat it out and pushed the plate away. The flavor and texture of the meat was all off. Rubbery would be a good adjective Tacos El Gordo, this is not. n nMy tamale was dry, dry, dry and the advertised ""red sauce "" was barely noticeable. There was really no flavor to the pork and, overall, was a really bland dish. Definitely would not order this again. n nI'm probably going to give the Casa a second chance. I enjoyed the ambiance and the service was friendly. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things.",1
Mediocre pizza.,1
"I would like to say that I emailed my concerns to the owner 2 3 weeks ago without a response AND I posted on the ""reviews "" section on their FB. Finally I received a comment on FB saying someone would be back to be soon, tomorrow at the latest. That was a week ago so here I am. I feel I've given them ample time and they are choosing not to address the issues and they have deleted our concerns from their FB page. n nFirst, I will say that their bulbs have always been good and we get a quality tan. That is the only positive thing I can say about the Surprise location. Their location on Bell and 63rd I think is the complete opposite, very clean and a very friendly staff. n nMy husband and I have been tanning here for 3 or 4 years at the Surprise location. In April of this year we noticed that things were going downhill. The overall cleanliness is poor, there is shelving ripped off the walls and not replace, clothes hooks ripped off the walls, some beds have music, some don't, etc. Most recently bed one was down for a month. We were told that someone used the wrong tanning lotion and they were waiting on a cleaner.for a month? Meanwhile we are forced to wait for a bed and if bed one was working, that would be lessened. n nObviously the owner doesn't care, that is clear with his lack of attention to these issues and it is a shame. n nTanners beware, the Surprise location is the ugly red headed step child. You will pay all the money at Celebrity, which is fine, but you will not receive high end service or accommodations.",1
"We got the avocado and lobster dip entree. It cost 10 bucks and I kid you not we only got 15 little chips and the whole thing was so salty we couldn't even get through it all. The baby back ribs tasted OK and the fries were awesome but after about 30 minutes we both had upset stomachs. Needless to say the whole experience was a letdown it was my first time there and a waste of 50 dollars which is way to expensive for a casual dinner, in my eyes . However, the servers were very nice and hospitable, so that's a plus.",1
"I honestly don't see where the complaints for this place are coming from. Just randomly stopped by on my way home and though we had to wait a few seconds to get seated by the hostess, she was very friendly. Our waitress came to us right away, dressed in a tank top and cowboy boots, was too friendly. There were a few tables seated and she was the only waitress on the floor. But she made sure every table was attended to and was polite in every way. Our meals came out, which we thoroughly enjoyed, asked for a side of jalepenos which she happily brought out for us free of charge. It's sad to see these harsh reviews on here. I'm glad I gave it a chance and stopped by!",2

"The food here is awesome! This Location is convenient off of US 60. I eat here often when seeing a movie next door at AMC Mesa Grand 24. I wanted to give this location 5 stars, but could not because I have not always had good service. The service quality depends on when you eat at this location. Usually the service is fast friendly, but if you come here when the high school kids are working, service usually is ok at best, if even that good. Overall very good except for a couple of times of rude service from the teenagers. I reported the rude teenagers to the manager on another visit and he said he would look into the situation. Service lately has been excellent.",2
I was not impressed with this restaurant. The food was average.and not very fresh. You could tell it was all frozen and processed. I'd rather spend my money on a dozen other restaurants that serve the same food but at a much higher quality.,1
"Talk about disappointed. We came here for a family trip a few years back, when the hotel was fairly new and it was just a bad experience. I came back here with some friends again about two years ago and nothing had improved. n nPositives The location, it's walking distance to all the main hotels on the strip, The lobby is really pretty you really feel like you might be in a nice area of Paris. Their buffet is great. Large selection of food and everything is delicious. n nNegatives The rooms, both times I went were broken down. The lamp shades were broken, the room felt kind dirty and stuffy. Even though the lobby is very pretty there is VERY little to do at the hotel. Not very many shops or restaurants in the lobby to keep you entertained. Most of the hotels in Vegas has so much to offer that you don't even feel like leaving where you're staying, but Paris hotel isn't quit like that.",1
"Stayed here twice, both for bachelorette parties. Def a girly, fun hotel. Decor is lovely and rooms are nice. The cool thing about this hotel is that they have balconies, I am not a smoker but my gfs who smoked loved this feature. nOnly annoying this is the long walks from the room to the main floor, so easy to get lost too.",2
Most amazing salon EVER! They fit me in on short notice and did an amazing job! I have been trying to dye my hair lighter it's originally a really dark brown and every time it came out orange. After saving numerous Pinterest and Instagram pics of my ideal color I headed to my appointment. Only thing. I didn't have to show the hairstylist! I explained what I wanted and she made it even better than I could ever imagine! I highly recommend seeing Samantha! She did an amazing job with my dark hair and I will be going back!,2
"I really dig this place. nThey have great drink specials during the day. The bartenders are all super chill. Every time a fire truck drives by with its sirens blaring, you get a 1 you call it. Also, with ""Fire Drills on Demand "" every time you order a meal, you are entitled to a 1 you call it. This is new, and when I asked about it the bartender had no idea what I was talking about. He reassured me that one dollar you call its only occurred when a flashing fire truck drove by, and I had to pull the flyer up for Fire Drills on Demand on my phone from longwongstempe.com to show him. He gave me my one dollar you call it after that, and apologized, saying the owners didn't keep the staff up to date. So, you may need to present proof about this little awesome deal if the bartenders are still not adequately informed. nAnyways, this place definitely has a fun atmosphere and local bands play on weekend nights. They also have open mic night on a certain night of the week. Actually, every time I have visited Long Wong's at night there has been someone on stage playing. nThe food is alright. It's more fast food quality than restaurant quality. The burgers are small and sort of disappointing. The onion rings are whatever. I have yet to try the pizza, but it looks pretty good. However, the wings are DELICIOUS and totally worth the trip to Long Wong's. Inferno is the absolute best flavor, and is actually really spicy. I'd like to point out that there is a pretty significant difference between the flavors of Spicy or Hot, whatever its called and Inferno. The inferno are much, much hotter and thus more delicious while the Spicy are a bit more on the average side as far as hotness goes. nOverall, a cool little place with awesome personality worth checking out. And try the wings.",2
"This course is fine to play, however we have experienced two issues that need mentioning. n nFirst, one of our foursome recently had his first ever hole in one here at Silverado. After the round, we mentioned the feat in the pro shop and you could have heard a pin drop. No fanfare whatsoever. Other courses generally offer to take the information down for publicity purposes or at least offer hearty congrats but not here. n nSecond, I recently attempted to make a reservation using a 2 rounds of golf certificate I had won at a local golf tournament. The head pro answered my call to the course, and advised me that the course was closed for two weeks for overseeding. My certificate expired in one week, so I asked if he could honor it right after the course reopened. You guessed the answer . . . . . . . ""No. "" n nSo it will be a long thime before my shadow again graces this particular course.",1

"This place is really good! I have been there twice and have enjoyed the food both times. The first time I got a cheeseburger. it was greasy, but in the best possible way. Tonight I got a hot dog. It was good, not the best I have ever had, but good. The relish was tasty and had that good green color like chicago relish. The hotdog was much better than the ones I've had at another hot dog place down the street.no names, but man that place was bad. The people who work there are always friendly and the food comes out quickly. n nOverall this is a good place, I recommend it for anyone wanting a burger or hotdog in tempe.",2
"I'm glad something was built on the old landfill, but seriously, THIS is what we got?! If it was like San Tan Village I would be thrilled. Instead, we get an abomination of a strip mall, with a parking lot that I'm convinced was designed by a drunk 6 year old, and some of the worst big box stores in history. Who, besides my grandmother, shops at JCPennys and Ross? nThere are simply not enough good reasons stores to go here. It's the worst of suburbia plopped down in a prominent location off the 202 and 101. nI don't like being only negative, so I will say that sometimes they have live music in ""The district "" and I've seen some good local bands.",1
"This used to be one of my go to places when I came to Vegas. I had been eating crepes here as far back as 2003. n nI would have definitely given 5 Stars. Unfortunately they changed their menu within the last year or two. Last time I was here was 05 2013 They no longer have the Fruits de Mer savoury seafood,mozzarella mushroom crepe w bechamel sauce . It has been replaced with a subpar shrimp scampi crepe. They also replaced their pear walnut almond Chantilly cream crepe with a pear hazlenut maple syrup golden raisin crepe. Also subpar.the flavors just don't go together as well as the former. The raisins are very overpowering. Not to mention the size of the crepes has shrank significantly as well, while the price has increased. I guess the consolation is that it is still entertaining to watch the crepe being made. n nThere used to always be a super long line, no matter what time of day. Last couple times I came during lunch 11 2ish , and there was only me and one or two other people. I sadly will probably never come back.unless they bring back the Fruits de Mer! That was the best crepe I have ever eaten! n nAlways the optimist, I will pass by next time and glance at the menu, fingers crossed hoping that they bring back the old menu.",1
"Yet another great experience at Jalapeno Inferno today. Came in around 4 30, right before the Sunday dinner rush. Service was great, our waitress was friendly and attentive. We were promptly served delicious flour tortilla chips which are dangerously good. Tonight I ordered the blood orange margarita which was tart and delicious. n nI had a sampler platter tonight which included a corn tamale, mini fundido's, a green chile quesadilla and queso w spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious. I ate way too much because it was oh so good! My fiance had the queso skillet chicken which was amazing as usual. The ambiance is also really nice here and it was a beautiful day to have the patio open with a nice breeze. n nOverall I am very impressed with Jalapeno Inferno. I will be back to try more! n n Going to try the lobster taco's on the next visit ",2
"We ordered the calamari appetizer and the field greens salad. The calamari was ok and it was nice to have two different dipping sauces. The field greens salad was good. I ordered the gnocci and my fiance ordered the linguini in clam sauce. The gnocci was ok, it was very buttery. The linguini pasta was cooked well but the sauce was gross. Like cat food gross. It did not look or taste homemade at all. Very disappointing and as you can tell by the picture there was a lot left. This is odd because my fiance is a garbage disposal. Everyone who knows him knows this, but he did not finish this plate. n nThe worst? I woke up at midnight very nauseous and threw up. n nThanks Il Posto.",1
"Stopped in for a quick bite at the bar before a poker tournament and was impressed with the food and presentation. All I had was a Spanish meat sandwich, but the flavors were outstanding, particularly in the side shot of fruit gazpacho. n nI would love to return for a larger meal.",2
"I give Cooperstown a five star based on their pricing alone. I ate lunch with 2 kids and our bill was 30 with tip. The food is nothing fancy just delicious and refreshing on a hot day. The girls said their chicken fingers and mac and cheese was good and I really enjoyed the Ty Cobb Salad. Also, love the giant glasses of iced tea. n nThe service was attentive and quick for being so busy. Neat place to go overall.",2
"Monty's is one of the many mind boggling Food Fight restaurants that is a Madison favorite despite serving mediocre food. n nI've eaten one good dish here the TNT BLT tempeh and tomato . And the chocolate shake is good if you need to consume an extraordinary number of calories on any given day. n nThe last time I went, I did so because a friend told me the restaurant is attempting to make a switch to more sustainability conscious, organic food. I ordered chili that was pretty much inedible. On another night, my boyfriend ordered a soup that was, again, inedible. n nI can imagine that people like to come here because the restaurant resembles an old school diner and has booths, which are fun for kids to sit in. But the food quality is generally average to poor. The brunch I've had is tasteless and limited, and you are not getting fresh eggs unless you order them over easy. n nThe only reason I give Monty's two stars is because its pies are great. And once in a while, I can stomach a TNT BLT because someone I'm with persuades me to give Monty's one . . . more . . . try.",1
"Reading the reviews below, I was a bit surprised. I have gone to this same GC for my latest 2 instruments.an acoustic Yamaha guitar and a Fender bass, and in both instances, the help I was given was tremendous. Both guys I spoke to were musicians, and both were willing to answer any question this relatively new guitar player had. They guaranteed that their prices would beat anything out there, including on line. In fact, they have a computer hooked up there that you can search on to see if someone offers lower prices. And as a full time salesman myself, I really valued 2 parts of my experience 1 both guys sold me guitars that were LESS expensive than the one I thought I wanted when I walked in and 2 they both called me a week after the purchase to see if I was happy with my purchase. BOTH guys were enthusiastic when talking to me. I absolutely love going to GC. Yes, there are times when someone will be in there testing a guitar out, and they might actually be good! That doesn't scare me off.it inspires me to get better. Man, it's a music store! And I wouldn't consider myself a young kid.I'm 50 and I dig this place. they aren't asking me to write this review.I just know that it's not often when review sites get anything but negative experiences recapped. Not saying the people below are wrong to express themselves.I'm just saying that it wasn't my experience and this location rocks.",2
"First time visiting Wok Box tonight with my husband and We were initially excited to try out this new restaurant rather than going to our usual chipotle. I visited their website and was pleased they had some gluten free items since I was recently diagnosed with a wheat allergy. When we first arrived at the counter they were very friendly and polite girl at the register helped us understand the menu and she pointed out some wheat free options for me. When my husband and I finally ordered, I got the large pad tai and he a large beef dish. Since I've only been gluten free for two weeks, I guess I was not specific enough with my order and about three minutes after I ordered I realized I should check with those cooking behind the counter to ensure my meal was being prepped gluten free. When I asked the woman behind the counter lady with long black straight hair in ponytail working around 6pm she quickly snapped at me and asked if I had specifically ordered my meal gluten free and then said that they had already made my meal so they would have to make another one for me. Her tone and reaction caught me by surprise and I said that I thought I did order my meal gluten free, but not wanting to get the sweet cashier girl in trouble for keying my order incorrectly, I didn't make a big deal out of it. When my meal was finally ready, she handed it to me and rudely stated, ""next time make sure to ordered it gluten free, we had already made your meal and we had to make another one! "" Again shocked by her tone, I just stood there, my husband actually came over to defend me but by then I was just done. Horrible, highly rude service. Also, when she remade my meal she gave me the small lunch portion when I paid for the large. She was so rude I'm almost certain she did that on purpose because she was angry about remaking my meal. nOn a side note, food was bland. Going forward, we'll still with Chipotle.",1
"Knowing what I know, I should Know better. It has been a while since I have been to a restaurant like this. Logan's Roadhouse, Roadhouse Grill and Texas Roadhouse are all one in the same. There actually is some kind of extended founding member split apart and competed with one another type relationship. Anyway we went for lunch and I remembered pretty quickly ""Oh yeah I do not like these places "". Ribs were actually DRY. Yes Dry. They were tender just DRY. Baked potato was old. The texture was dry as if it was a re heated potato.maybe it wasn't but it tasted and appeared as if it was. Ribs were not heated through. I know thy just grill them to finish them to order but they needed another few minutes on the grill. Caesar dressing tasted like ranch dressing. All in all.yeah yeah yeah the schtick of peanuts on the floor and meh food. If you think it is so great I am sure Olive garden and Red Lobster also appreciate your business. That does not make any of them good !",1
"I have a favorite tapa place back home, nBut good food might actually beat that place. Everything we had was delicious and the service was great. You can't make reservations and it fills up fast, but the food is worth the wait.",2
"This is a modern interpretation of a Brazilian steak house, and it succeeds in most respects, especially the competent food. However, there are rough edges. The drinks are expensive and hardly generous. The service, even when the restaurant was less than half full, was a little too slow. And one of our party had the bad luck to order a steak medium rare and get it very well done indeed. When he sent it back, it took them over 20 minutes to bring him another entirely too long for such a dish. The waiter's response was ""it's not my fault. "" However, it was comped and we all got free dessert, which is at least part of a proper response. Probably worth going to, if you have a 2 for 1 coupon.",2
"I used to work downtown and went to Frida for lunch all the time. I thought it was great! Note the past tense. My friends and I including 2 toddlers and a baby arrived around noon for lunch. We sat on the patio outside and had the place to ourselves. Our server wasn't very friendly. I asked her where the tostadas were on the menu and she said the menu was new. I was really sad I LOVED THEM! but ordered enchiladas and a taco for my son. I also ordered guacamole and was very disappointed. It's creamy texture makes me think it wasn't homemade which I find to be unacceptable at a Mexican restaurant. The waitress never refilled our chips. The salsa was watered down I don't remember it being that bad . I asked for sour cream for my enchiladas which never came. The waitress came back to ask if I had received it and I said no. She asked if I still wanted it and I said yes. I needed something to wash down the dry enchilada. I am not sure if she charged me or not. I was also surprised by the prices a root beer was 4 and I was charged extra for ground beef in my enchiladas! I ordered a steak taco for my son and the meat looked inedible. n nI must disclose the fact that we weren't the quietest customers. Dining with 2 toddlers is tricky so I got my son a bag of popcorn and he proceeded to pour a lot on the ground I am very sorry for this . Later, the patio started to get really crowded and my son and my friend's son were getting loud so we asked for our check. I took my son away so he wouldn't disrupt anyone else and waited for my friends to join me. About 15 minutes my friends came to find me saying they had to look for the waitress to run her credit card. You would think she would want such loud customers to leave as soon as possible!",1
Very authentic?! There was even a faint resentment towards people without exact change and those who did not speak French.,1
"Wouldn't give me a cup of water with my meal, bad customer service. Not enjoyable experience here at all.",1
"Came here for a concert which was pretty cool. But the pool was kind of depressingly small and uninviting overall. The hot tub is a hole in the ground, and the drinks were pretty expensive. n nPerhaps it's just a small pool for a relatively small casino, but considering a lot of it looks new, it was just unimpressive overall.",1
"I have been a Jamba juice customer for years! Recently I've been coming to this location because they do half off smoothies before 10am. The owner has decided to flip flop on this policy that has earned them my business. I will not be coming back, I would much rather pay full price elsewhere!",1
"When we were making last minute plans to take my cousins to Vegas, I prayed and I hoped that we could find an affordable room at the Wynn vegan paradise! , but with the cheapest clocking in at 900 night SOB , it just wasn't going to happen this time. So we booked at the Mandalay, knowing there'd at least be the best pool in the world to soothe the pain of not being at the Wynn. What I didn't know was that there'd also be Slice of Vegas to make me SO SO happy! n nIt's a casual Italian eatery, and coming from the suburbs of Philly, I felt right at home. Nothing fancy, not too much hoopla, just standard American Italian fare that fills your belly with a warm light and maybe acid reflux that you'll carry with you for the rest of the day. This, my friends, is comfort food. n nWhat sets Slice of Vegas apart from the pizza joints of my youth is their amazing vegan menu! Not even kidding you, it has everything you could possibly ever want at a place like this. Pizza, pasta, salads really? you're eating a salad? , appetizers, sandwiches, DESSERTS.oh lordy, they thought of everything. They left no stone unturned. n nI was lured by the meatball sandwich, and went high to hog heaven with the first bite. A great roll they even call it a hoagie roll, like my people back east! , a rich balanced sauce, the perfect amount of daiya mozzarella, and gardein meatballs, which are probably my favorite outside of homemade. It came with sweet potato fries, and our darling waitress said the magic words, ""Would you like a side of ranch with that? "" WOULD I?! Gimme gimme gimme. n nSam was perfectly content with his spaghetti and spicy marinara, and would've come back for it every meal if I'd let him. We stuffed ourselves silly and had no room for dessert, which was the saddest thing. I even tried to come back later after a night of dancing, but they were long closed. Alas, I can add this place to my repertoire of super vegan friendly restaurants in Vegas, and I'm very happy that I don't absolutely have to go to the Wynn to be well fed to the point of bursting .",2
"I drive by this place everyday on the way to work and it always smells so delicious when I drive by in the afternoon, but I think the catch is that any caveman can throw a slab of meat on a hot surface and our inner carnivore will growl a quick yummmmm and then move on. I wish I would have taken the move on advice in this case. n nI suggested we order lunch from this place for work and we passed the menu around in amazement at all of the option that we had and the ordering began. Once lunch was picked up and brought back we all quickly dug in and then we all quickly stopped digging in. There was a mix of things ordered, Chicken Wraps, 3 piece plates, and sides like mac and cheese and ceaser salads. n nI am not overly picky but I will say the chicken in my wrap was EXTREMELY dry and there was absolutely no flavor to the entire wrap. The coworker to my right stopped eating his plain chicken and cheese wrap after he pulled 4 bones out of it and to top it off, one of my other co workers could not stand to eat his mac and cheese because it was so runny. n nI apologize now to all of you Nevada Chicken lovers that may be reading this but this place was absolutely horrible and I think we will be going back to ordering El Pollo Loco as sad as that is.",1
"Oh. my. lord. n nWent to Savor Scottsdale's Notorious P.I.G. event at Digestif and can't even put into words how great everything was. All the credit does not go to Payton Curry, as each course was from a different chef and a different part of the same pig, but WOW. Chef Curry was certainly the entertainment for the evening, with personality that just doesn't quit. And having him gush to our table about his Easter Sunday menu, beginning with carrot soup, ending with carrot cake, and everything rabbit in the middle, I will certainly be visiting Digestif more often. We've also seen him at the farmer's market, picking out the freshest produce he can find. it's not just a schpeel, this guy is serious about utilizing local ingredients. n nAnyway, back to the pig. Every course was made to perfection, half of which I had never heard of before. and paired perfectly by Todd Bostock with Dos Cabezas wines. I could go on for pages, but suffice it to say that you all should support your local chefs and watch out for more great events from Savor Scottsdale, a non profit organization working to put Scottsdale on the map as a culinary destination. n nProps to Chef James Porter of Tapino, Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Chef Brandon Crouser of Atlas Bistro, and Chef Tracy Dempsey of Cowboy Ciao, et al.

"I'm not a fan of indoor malls. but Caesar's makes it easier with the high ceilings and clouds sky painted above you. You can find anything and everything here mostly high end stores .

"Great tasting Mexican food on the cheap! Better tasting than many of the sit down Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. It's a small little place with a dine in or drive through option. Many delicious items to choose from.my favorites are the steak and cheese quesadilla, cheese enchiladas, frijoles, and their awesome salsa!",2
Friendly staff. Food is awesome. Drinks for happy hour great. Always a place to make you feel at home.,2
"Perhaps not the worst eatery in the galaxy but this place reminds me of Death. Cornerstones appear to be below average, oversalted Italian and slow, sometimes indifferent service. Old folks abound, perhaps reassured by the gimmicky old tyme nostalgia, with the trolley, fake tiffany lamps, etc. Instead, it transports me to the 1970s, to sprawling east coast chains off the turnpike I'd get dragged to as a kid with waits, bland food, very young staff going thru the motions, and crap on the walls to distract from the underlying mediocrity. n nIt's not horrible, and will appeal to that handful of Americans actually older than me, but I've little interest recapturing the sleepy era this factory is shooting for.",1
"If i could give this place a 0, I would! n nLong story short, money was stolen from our room and the hotel claims they can't do anything about it. So what's the point of staying at a high end place when they can't even protect their rooms?!?! n nShadyness under all the fancy crystals in the building.and i've read and heard this happens often. n nI'll stick to Wynn, thank you.",1
"The food was awful! nI know this is no place for vegetarians, but this is beyond ridiculous. We went there for the 1st time for a quick bite, and ordered nVegetable dumplings, coconut fried rice and Singapore style thin noodles. n nThe coconut fried rice was rice in brown sauce, with sheredded coconut on top. And it tasted horrible. n nThe noodles are by the the worst. n nI don't understand how his place has survived for 5 long years.",1

"This place is a total scam. We reserved a car for 7 days for 187. We were then charged over 700 for the car rental, luckily I noticed this on my credit card the next day, so I returned the car immediately and was only charged 253 for 2 days. Then my credit card company called and told me my credit card number was stolen. Since I had only used the at Fox as it was a new card , I knew exactly who stole the number. So we went back to Fox with the police the next day. I will NEVER use them EVER again. Word of warning, don't let this happen to you.",1
"Came here to submit my CCW paperwork and get fingerprinted. At first, I thought my experience was going to be on par with waiting in line at the DMV the horror, the horror , but I was gladly mistaken. n nI just got a number and sat for a bunch of time. Although, at first I thought that I was getting skipped, but it turns out that they rotate their sets of numbers three times. n nThe lady at the counter was very nice and friendly, processed my paperwork, had me fill out a section that I forgot about but didn't give me any attitude about it , collected my cashiers check, then sent me on my way to get fingerprinted and photo taken in another area. n nThat wait was all of about 5 minutes for both fingerprinting AND getting my picture taken. n nAll in all, I went on a Friday afternoon, a few hours before closing, and ended up giving up about 45 minutes out of my day. n nHonestly, I'd hate to see them when they're really busy. Thanks guys and gals. Keep up the good work.",2
"Had the custom meal and tried the chicken, asparagus and quinoa with the pine nut pesto. For all the pesto lovers the sauce was delicious! I also tried the watermelon and strawberry cocktail which was also great. Best part is that you can customize based on what you like. All in all great healthy place to try.",2
"The food at Big Burrito isn't that bad but they have a lot of work to do. I cannot think of a reason to visit this establishment over the other Mexican fast food joints. n nI ordered the enchilada and burrito combo with carnitas. The pork was diced as opposed to shredded and it was not very tasty. To their credit, though, the portions were fair and I did not leave hungry. n nThe folks do a good job of keeping the place clean which is not the norm at other places I've been to. n nIf you're already in the area and in need of nourishment, Big Burrito is not a bad option. Just don't expect anything special. It's edible.",1
"I was eating my wicked , as I seen the manager ask everyone how there food was doing . I was resting my feet on a chair and he told me , that I couldn't have my feet on the chair . Then he asked me if I could eat my food at the tables outside , so a family of 4 could eat there meal. Cause I was eating at a table that sat 4. So I moved outside too finish eating my meal . After 5 mins my milk shake had melted . It's 1pm and like 105 degrees outside. So my milkshake, is melted so I pored it out in the trash and walked in too fill it up with juice . The manager approaches me again , he tells me I have too pay for the juice in my cup . So he takes my cup dumps it out and tells me too stand in line to purchase a new one . By the time I get back outside to finish my food I see that my sandwich is on the floor and there's birds picking at it .So I just left without finishing .",1

Horrible customer service at the Arrowhead location! Every time I go into this place it takes far too long and employees are rude. There is no organization and I have witnessed customers being helped completely out of order.leaving others to wait longer. Seriously they need to get their act together and hire some employees that have an IQ above mental retardation. Don't take your business here!,1
"I was a little bummed to see a chain restaurant open in the neighborhood, but figured I'd give it a chance. That was a mistake. Went with a large party. Everyone's food, and I mean everyone's was over sauced. Not one person finished their meal. Most barely made a dent. We ALL agreed is was just not good. So sad. Something locally owned would have been a much better addition to the neighborhood.",1

"The wonderful views of Edinburgh from the Castle come from it being built on a hill as a defensive fortification to fend off hostile armies from below and one is reminded of that by the cannons still pointed at the city below. Edinburgh Castle dominates the city landscape and it's a good if pricey visit. At the top of the Royal Mile, you pass by the inevitable William Wallace dressed guy ala Mel Gibson with his face painted like a crazed football fan, then through a large open space where the Military Tattoo takes place just before you get to the Castle. Statues of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace at the entrance give little hint to the treasures literally inside. n nAfter paying for admission tickets, we enter to see the Scottish Crown Jewels, cannons, Mons Meg, the small chapel, war museums, and majestic views of Edinburgh below. Like the British Crown Jewels on display in the Tower of London, viewing has a time limit. There was a Scottish bagpiper playing that day in front of the War Museum, providing yet another photo op thank goodness for digital cameras with photos cards with memory for many pix. You need at least 3 4 hours to go through the Castle but it being up on a hill, be prepared for blustery winds when you're outside so a windproof jacket and comfortable walking shoes are advisable. All in all, a good way to spend 1 2 day surrounded by history and working up an appetite.",2
I love this space! It totally differentiates itself from all other Vegas venues through it's intimate layout which offers a more enjoyable experience. You truly get to feel the bands and ambiance through great acoustics. n nI've had the pleasure of catching bands like Leche de Tigre to Street Drum Corps. I love the variety in their lineups and totally recommend catching a show here.,2
"Great service very reasonable prices. The food was amazing. One thing I did not understand, they do not give you an itemized receipt you have to ask for it. They can charge whatever desire. The cocktails were amazing. We took our servers suggestion and ordered the bar mans special, the cocktail was very good. When I checked in on Yelp it gave a 30 off on the cocktails for locals, but surely the manager accommodated us with the 30 off on all the cocktails we had. I can say they were very nice and tasty.",2
"This Tempe outpost of Buffalo Wild Wings is their 700th store. Just about 3 blocks from the Rural University train station, it's a very convienent location to access via transit. They do offer complimentary surface parking which is something that cannot be said for downtown Tempe locations. n nThe atmosphere is exactly the same as every other BWW. Over the top TV visual stimulation, bright white lights that would blind you if you looked into them, and a ridiculous amount of people in the restaurant at all times. I asked for one of the TVs to be tuned to the Diamondbacks game, and after trying to find it for 15 minutes, they put it on a small TV because the big one was carrying a U of A v. Iowa football game. Look, not only is this game a 4 days old replay, but you're in ASU territory so please put the LIVE broadcast of the HOME team on the big television. They refused. About 5 minutes later, another bar patron asked that same TV showing football to be changed to Cubs v. Giants, and there was no hesitation on their part to get this done. I was a little befuddled. n nThe food is shy of average. When I go to a place that specializes in buffalo wings, give me some decent buffalo wings. These things are tiny, overcooked, balls of grease. I tried the garlic parmesan, spicy garlic, medium, and asian zing sauces. The garlic parmesan was kind of gross, the asian zing was identical to the bottle of Mae Ploy sweet and spicy glaze I have in my refrigerator. The other two were fine sauces, but the meat portions and quality were crap. n nOn my visit, they had just opened two days prior so I'll cut them slack on the mishaps, which were plentiful, on the bartender servers part. I won't however, write a review without mentioning the behavior of the managerial staff. Is this amateur hour? The TWO MANAGERS got out a book of ID cards which supposedly had every ID in the country with pictures and ways to tell if it's fake. Every out of state ID they saw, they referenced the book. What I have to ask is if they are managers of a big time chain restaurant, shouldn't they have seen an ID or two in their day? Don't they have a history of working in bars restaurants? Shouldn't they have carded people in the past? I then watched them brushing their teeth behind the bar. Lost my damn appetite. The employees aren't being trained quickly because the management team is a bunch of buffoons. n nFYI, if you recently turned 21 and have a vertical ID, don't go here because they won't take it. Someone needs to tell them they are by a college campus. I watched at least a dozen people be turned down for drinks because of the vertical ID.",1
"One chilly Sunday AM that we happen to be on the Eastside of town, we dec'd that we wanted to have breakfast and try something new. My husband wanted to go to Ellis Island, always a safe choice and unfortunately, would've probably been better off going there. n nSo to start, it's downtown. Parking can be difficult, the crazies roam around deal with it, they're about to pass out to sleep lol. It was about 9 00am so there was a little bit of a wait, 20 mins for us. n nSERVICE We were greeted by someone who we thought was our sever, turns out she only brought out drinks, ok. Server finally made his way over to our table and he was a borderline D. We were greeted with a very bland ""Ready to order or do you need more time? "", took out order and we rarely saw him after that. Everyone else other than our server was attentive and very nice. n nSHRIMP GRITS Lacked the flavor that I was looking for. Lola's has their version of Shrimp Grits that blows this one out of the water. The shrimp was way overcooked, practically rubbery. Grits is flavorless so you have to add things to it to give it some taste and it usually mellows out a dish and takes on the flavor of the sauce that the shrimp is cooked in. Unfortunately, the grits muted the flavor of the shrimp rendering it to be practically bland and an all around disappointment. n nCHICKEN FRIED STEAK Tasted like it was a few days past its use by date, husband was so disappointed in it. n nPASSION FRUIT ICED TEA The best part of my meal. WTF. n nAMBIANCE Hipster and beyond. This is something that reminds me of what you'd find out in SF or SoCal. Menu's presented on clipboards, urban chic decor, great idea and if we went by ambiance alone, then this place would be 5 stars! Too bad, so sad it's not.",1

"Maybe the best frites I've had, even better than the ones in Belgium. Absolutely to die for. The sliders were awesome. The oysters were good, but had chunks of shell in them which very much disrupted the dish. Maybe it's just me, but having to reach in your mouth to pull out chunks of shell in a nice restaurant seems awkward at best. n nOther than that, it was very good though. And the ""Liquid Nitrogen Frozen Cocktails "" are worth trying once just for the floor show, but the cocktail was excellent too.",2
"I am excited to have OBBC in the neighborhood. It has quickly overtaken The Malt House as my neighborhood spot for a pint no knock on The Malt House .

The Strong Ale and Commuter Kolsch have been personal favorites and I look forward to more selections as the season changes. n nThe guest tap selection is stellar and very reasonably priced. The snacks are delicious. I would eat a never ending bowl of the hot pretzels, which may or may not be supermarket frozen pretzels, they are delicious.",2
We were very disappointed in our lunch. It's a very tiny place and not comfortable. They try to act like a high end restaurant but look like a tiny fast food place. My chicken salad sandwich was just okay with the bread sagging and not able to hold up the ingredients. My husband's portabello mushroom sandwich was terrible. The mushroom was oil soaked and not edible. They are way over priced for what they serve. The popover you get is good and if you like that kind of butter the strawberry butter is flavorful. We won't be back and won't recommend it.,1
"Excellent food, very nice staff and beautiful live music. Very clean with a warm, cozy atmosphere. If this place were closer to my house, it would be my destination every time we go out to eat.",2
"Here into my second week living in Charlotte I'm glad I made it out to Reedy Creek Park albeit on a chilly otherwise bleak winter day. The park is quite large and seems to have a decent mixture of nature trails and athletic related areas. We went straight to the Nature Center and looked at the interesting displays. Was welcomed by the people at the counter which was a positive sign hard to believe some people with jobs like this could have a sour attitude. The trails are interesting and well laid out, however even with a map and following the obvious lay of the land and lots of outdoor experience I still couldn't make out part of the trail to loop around the lake. Bikes are prohibited in most areas it appears, which on a busy day I guess makes a lot of sense, although on an empty day like today it seems like a bike would have been a lot of fun. As a nature preserve this seems to a pretty good park. If you wanted to come in and out of here via non motorized transport it would be far from ideal however. Glad Charlotte has some decent green space.",2
"I was keen to try the clock caf u00e9 because it looks so warm and funky from the outside. I did not make it past the menu in the window. It promises the sort of pizza pasta stuff that screams Reheated factory food served daily. Have a look at the photo of breakfast on this page. Do you really want something like that put in front of you? n nA place that looks so good should serve great food which does not have to be expensive. Fresh local produce cooked on site with a Scottish emphasis. In winter I want to see a menu with split pea soup, with ham hock in it for carnivores. French onion soup with garlic croutons Scottish garlic of course which is glorious right now. Slow cooked lamb shank with potato and swede. Root vegetable and bean curry. Lots of kale of course. Stuffed cabbage leaves. nI cry when I think of how fantastic this place could be.",1
"As other reviews have mentioned, the space is very crowded. There is barely room to stand inside of the door to wait. The women that work in the salon have to eat their lunch sitting on a milk crate in the back and there is no space.so the crate is in front of the bathroom door and you can barely get inside. n nI've found they do a fine job at pedicures, but do not go here for a gel shilack manicure. They polish starts lifting after two or three days. I've been maybe five times and every single time this happens. I won't be back for a manicure, despite their close proximity to my house walking distance . n nThey also tell you they ""prefer cash "" when you try to pay with your card. I find this odd for a business of this size, especially when they see you are paying with a card. Whatever the reason, it made me feel uncomfortable.",1
"I have been a member of this gym since it opened. I used to really like this gym, but am seriously considering switching to the new LVAC opening on Decatur and the 215. Every summer the A C breaks down. Lately, the Cardio Theatre treadmills have been out of commission and the gym itself has been way too hot. I'm surprised they actually have the stair masters fixed correctly. They are often also out of paper towels and disinfectant spray. The ladies' restroom stalls can be very messy on Sunday's too. While before I would recommend this gym to anyone in the North Las Vegas area, I cannot say the same now.",1
12 went for dinner. Service was great. Steaks were all very undercooked and horribly bland. Tasteless and chewy. Some sent theirs back and they came back dry. Have been there many times over the years and enjoyed it tremendously each time. This steak dinner was one of the worst dinners I've ever had. Won't be back.,1
"Have dined many times at this restaurant and been very satisfied. However I ate a bowl of chili that made me very sick. I called the diner to talk to the manager and told him about the chili. He did not even apologize and rudely said ""I will look into it "" and hung up. Not good customer service.",1
"Meh. Yeah, that was a pretty good pizza. Amazingly thin crust with the perfect amount of sauce and cheese. However, the outer rim of my pizza was pretty badly burnt and tasted awful. And the salami on the Sonny Boy is INCREDIBLY salty yes, I know it's salami.but geez . I'd advise you to customize your own pizza when you finally get a seat and not go with the suggested combos. But enough about the food. n nAn hour and twenty minutes to get a seat by myself at the bar? On a Tuesday night? No way that was worth it. I suppose it's considerate of them to have a wine bar next door that patrons can wait in, but it just made me pay more money for appetizers and beer to pass the long wait. I'll admit the focaccia appetizer I got was scrumptious.but no deal breaker, by any means. n nSo, bottom line, if you have absolutely nothing to do with your evening, come here with a group of friends. You might get some comfortable seating in the wine house as you wait for who knows how long and enjoy your pies over cheerful conversation when the blue moon finally passes and you score some seats. But I'm sure you have better things to do.",1
"This review is based on the BREAKFAST service. n nI understand breakfast probably isnt their specialty, but they advertise the steak and egg special, and brazilian coffee . I was in the area and needed something quick. n nUnderstaffed, slow. 15minutes for breakfast coffee ? n nHostess was considerate , kitchen staff were nice when delivering meal. However the waitstaff had poor attitudes and were non caring. Orderen a Bacon and egg breakfast. They forgot the bacon? Really? n nhad to re order bacon from the kitchen , it took ten minutes for 2 strips of bacon n nbetter service at Dennys for Bfast",1
Our Valentines Day plans fell through so we ended up here. We were seated and we sat there for about 10 minutes until a waitress came up and said she would take care of us because she didn't know who our waiter was. We ordered the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer and my wife ordered the shrimp scampi and I ordered a sirloin. The place wasn't very busy at all. We waited about 20 minutes for our appetizer. Then about 10 minutes after that our waitress came up and said they were out of sirloin. So instead I ordered the build your own burger. Everything was good except the shrimp scampi. It tasted like regular noodles and wasn't worth the 14 we paid for it. The waitress was really nice she did give us our appetizer for free. But the very slow service didn't make up for it. I don't think we'll be back.,1
"The food wasn't bad per se. It's just the whole feel of the restaurant and the limited options of the set lunch menu, which when they appeared were quite underwhelming, contrasted with all the other Thai places I've tried in Edinburgh, made me really think that Yes, I have experienced better thanks for that prompt Yelp! n nThe set lunch menu was u00a38.95. There were only two starter options a chicken tom yum soup or veggie spring rolls . These two options are very.meh. Like VERY meh. Soup or spring rolls? What if you want just some good ol' fashioned meat. I couldn't help but compare it to the lunch deal I'd had at Dusit, on Thistle Street, which had 4 starter options all of which were much more exciting, and had chicken, beef, prawn tempura three ways or a vegetable option that wasn't pastry coated. n nThe main options also left a lot to be desired. And when they arrived the portions were small. My beef salad wasn't badly cooked, I ate it and enjoyed it for what it was. But I would have equally enjoyed, or maybe even moreso, a u00a33 sandwich from Marks Spencers. n nWhen you go for a lunch out at a restaurant mid week, it is something of a special occasion. And the lunch here was very forgettable. One of my dining partners told me she had heard rumours of exciting food on their a la carte menu, like beef spaghetti ? And normally if I don't enjoy a lunch I will give the restaurant one more chance and go back to try the evening meal. But I also didn't really gel with the feel of the restaurant. As the same dining partner commented, it felt like a hotel lobby. All cold steel metals, hard edges and lacking in any ambiance. Bizarre music on the stereo. n nAlthough the staff were really lovely. Very attentive, smiling, eager, and trying very hard to please. It's just a shame that the food was limited in option, quite forgettable when it arrived and the ambiance did not tempt me back in any way.",1
"Always clean, bright enough to hurt your retinas and well stocked. This location is always busy and it seems as though the throngs of customers cant follow the designated flow of the Yogurtland path to happiness and a cluster always ensues. n nGreat selection of ever changing flavors I'm partial to the tart and more than ample choices for toppings. Complimentary tasting cups are available as is refreshing, fruit infused water. n nWish there was additional seating, better parking and a dimmer for the lighting.",2
"Prime location, Prime Price but pretty much everything else is tragically bad. n nThe place is run down and super old, pretty sure all the living areas are left over from the 70's except for the flatscreen upgrade lol . The room is spartan, there is absolutely no frils included in the room, you get 2 chairs, 2 lamps, tv, a table 2 beds, sheet brown blanket, pillows, soap and towels. Everything else is bare, i'm surprised they even have the Gideons Bible in the drawer. n nwalking in from the the self park, it looks like a your entering coming from the future and they're excavacting this hotel relic. Theres power equipment everywhere in the corridor leading to the empty shop arcade and the casino. Theres men in hardhats and safety vests working and hotel guests are moving between them trying to get to their cars. there's construction dust and paint everywhere as well. This is going on 24 7. n nThey should've just closed the entire building and renovted it at once instead of leaving it open and renovating it with people inside, its making it a terrible customer experience. n nIf your room has a good view of the strip, don't expect to sleep before 3 because downstairs theres Carnval Court and outdoor club and they are banging music which you will feel through the glass balcony door. I wasn't there to party sadly, so this bothered me. But wouldn't be an issue if I was there to party. n nAnyway, this hotel was not good for me. But ""the quad "" as th, e name suggests would be perfect for college kids in Vegas, the name even sounds like something at a university. Its cheap and old and dirty but if you're a college age kid on a budget this is the perfect place because all of it doesn't matter because tyou're there to just get ripped and you probably won't be in your room all that often. But if you are and you break shit or mess shit up they probably won't even notice, so you won't get hit on your credit card later. Also bonus cheap gaming tables downstais so thats ok. n nTL DR if you thought you were getting a good deal on hotels.com.only if you're college age and all you wanna do is rage. If you're anybody else you should probably look elsewhere.",1
"You know how every one claims ""their "" Starbucks. Well, this one is ""mine. "" Parking is not the greatest, but the service is always on point.

"Once upon a time, a party of 12 of us descended upon Mickey Mooch to celebrate the birthday of one of our fair maidens. Based on the restaurant's d u00e9cor and lavish entrance, I was surprised to open my menu and found that the pricing on items were pretty reasonable, considering. I had expected entrees to be higher priced. However, we soon found that ""lower "" prices come with many consequences. n nDrinks After 30 minutes of being seated, some were still waiting for their beverages. When they finally received their bottles of beer, they were ""as is. "" No glass. What kind of ""upscale "" restaurant serves beer without a glass? We weren't sitting at the bar we were in the dining room. One of the beers was a Blue Moon brought in its bottle. Don't the bartenders know that Blue Moon is always traditionally served with an orange slice? It's like serving a lime with a Corona. Someone else ordered a martini. It was sloshed around as it was set down in front of him. He had to wipe up the spillage by himself. n nBread Bread was served but it was cold like it was taken out of a freezer and not fully thawed . They asked to have the half frozen bread taken away and replaced with ""warm "" bread at least twice it never came during the entire two and a half hours we were there. n nSalads We asked if we could get something besides a regular garden salad. Our server advised a Caesar salad or Wedge in its place. We were never told that there was a significant upcharge to getting a slightly different salad. 2.95 for the Caesar, 3.95 for the Wedge.the same cost if you ordered them separately. When this was brought to the attention of our server at the end of the meal, he brushed it off. I'm guessing it happens a lot at the restaurant. The salads arrived we had to ask for silverware for the 2nd time . Several minutes passed and I finally got up and swiped them off an empty table. Minutes after we had started using the newly acquired silverware and eating our salads, the server finally returned.with ONE set of silverware. I guess we were supposed to share? n nEntrees Our entrees arrived halfway through the salads. After delving into the entrees, several people had puzzled looks on their faces. Some had ordered their steaks medium rare or medium. They came out with raw meat in the middle. And not just a small portion it was golfball sized. Medium rare means pink with some reddish tones not raw. Worse, one person ordered pork. It, too, had a golfball sized red raw center. Trichinosis, anyone? At this point, we called over a manager. When the raw pork was displayed to her, she tried to tell us that it was ""fat. "" Red fat? In the middle of a pork cut? Being served the raw pork is one thing. Passing it off as acceptable by a manager is poor crisis management. All of the undercooked meats were taken away to ""re cook "" or replace. The steaks were returned within a few minutes the pork wasn't. With the plates that were taken away for the steaks were the side items that everyone had ordered. These were not returned on the plates and had to be ""re ordered "" by us specifically requesting them from the server and or manager. One friend ordered drawn butter with his salmon. It didn't come until he was halfway through the salmon, about 15 minutes later. n nHalfway through my meal, I finished my glass of wine and ordered another glass. It didn't come until I was through with my entr u00e9e and the plate had been cleared. Great timing.and I'm not a fast eater. After everyone finished eating and plates were cleared, the ""new "" pork finally arrived. n nBill Did I mention the Wedge salad that was on my bill after everything we went through and it was brought to the attention of the server that we were never advised about the upcharge? After all our problems, getting the bill with all the additions was like a kick in the head after being punched in the stomach for a couple of hours. n nSummary I'm just telling you the story from my side of the table. I don't even know everything that went on at the other side of the 12 person table. I only gathered stories here and there. It wasn't just one error. It was one after another. It wasn't just one person at the table. It was practically everyone who had a problem. When the numerous errors were brought to their attention, the errors were not handled in an appropriate manner by the waitstaff or the management team. The biggest problem of the night was that nobody seemed to care whether we had a poor experience or not. The kicker was that afterwards I wrote a 3 page letter to Mickey Mooch corporate.and got no response. They apparently didn't care either. So I guess they won't care if I take my money elsewhere. n nThe End. Happily Never After.",1

"Normally I'd dock one star for being a bit overpriced, but I actually think Za's deserves all five. Everything I've ever had in my 4 years in Champaign was delicious. Dessert, pizza, pasta, buffalo chicken salad, I could pretty much name everything on the menu and not have one bad thing to say. Love the ambiance here too especially the upstairs! Great for pick up or even a nice dinner when you don't want to spring for a more formal sit down place.",2

"Holy crap, out of all restaurant I picked this place. n nFood the Mongolian rice was hard and the veges was not cooked at all. Orange chicken was so nasty, it should be called bell pepper chicken not orange. n nSerivce let's say the girl was not very responsive. But I do give 2 stars for the manager being so polite and letting us know how everything worked. n nOverall I probably would not be returning.",1
"The shoes we bought broke within minutes of wearing. We tried to return them the same day and were told the manager would come and discuss the issue with us in about an hour. After two and a half hours of waiting the manager called the attendant and said we were not to get an exchange or refund under any terms because the shoes were worn too much. nDespite returning within hours and not even having walked to dinner in them, the shoes lacked durability and the store refused to even meet us half way.",1
"Visited Moe's for the first time in about a year for their birthday promo Free Burrito w purchase of a large drink , and I have to say I was let down relative to my relatively mild expectations. n nOn a positive side, Moe's definitely has their lunch process nailed down to an efficient machine. They pump people quick enough through the line that there's often a bottleneck and a battlefield at the open salsa station and drink stand. n nRelative to the food, as many others have referenced, Moe's offers your typical Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. style build your own Mexican bar. Being similarly priced to those options, the quality of Moe's ingredients simply doesn't compare and can best be described as bland at best. n nThe ""free "" chips with every meal I hate these type of sales gimmicks are honestly outgunned by your standard grocery store Tostidos fare. I haven't tried the queso, so that may act as a saving grace. n nWith an abundance of great establishments downtown to grab lunch, Moe's just doesn't make a meaningful price benefit argument.",1
The hotel room was very outdated and the location is not so central since you cannot wait to get out of your room to feel civilized. The gambling is set up very well but it is not a hotel I would recommend if you want to have any romance to your stay. This hotel is perfect for those who just want to throw their bags down and go!,1
"The lunch special actually runs all day long, which is fantastic. For two rolls, plus miso and a ginger salad, 10.95 cannot be beat. n nHowever, the rolls at full price I'm not sure when you would get charged that wouldn't at all be worth it. They are of decent quality, but happen to be very small. n nLastly, the impression that I'll have on my mind when considering this place in the future will be of the service. Our waitress did not visit our table at all after serving our meal, which means drinks weren't refilled, plates weren't cleared, and the check was not brought to us. She even stood over us as we filled out the tip on our bill! n nGo for the lunch special, and expect nothing more.",1
"What is it about this place that I absolutely love? It's smack near the sportsbook. And any cafe or restaurant near or adjacent to a sportbook is good eating at Vegas. Is it the simple burgers or the chicken strips that keep me coming back? Or is it just the convenience and lack of crowds? n nOn the second floor of Imperial Palace, right next to the race and sportsbook is the Burger Palace. It's a simple, cafeteria eating place with quite a large menu of burgers, fries, chicken, salads and other fried items that are not really helpful for you. n nI like the fact that it seems a little old school Vegas in there. It sometimes feels like a local joint that's in the middle of the Strip. I love that I don't see club scene gals or douchy guys in there. No Ed Hardy shirts, no Axe fragrants, no prostitute looking women nothing annoying. n nSo if you're not in the mood for the long lines for buffets or over priced restaurants, give Burger Palace a try if you want simple comfort food to fill you up. It's cheap so you can save your money for the slots. A high recommendation.",2
"I hate to write mean reviews, but I really did receive the worst haircut of my life no hyperbole from this place, one that really can't be fixed now until I wait for it to grow out. I walked in with long hair and normal looking bangs that all needed significant trimming. The stylist said he would need to take a couple of inches off of the length due to damage. I said that was fine. I did not ask for any other style changes. I somehow walked out with bangs that take up most of the front part of my head, much like a small child's haircut to serve the purpose of keeping hair out of the child's face . He also took almost five inches off the length, instead of the ""couple "" promised. I feel like my haircut looks like a cross between a bowl cut, a female mullet, and the futuristic look of Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction. I'm pretty open minded to different haircuts, but this one is truly awful, and it's too short now for me to even pull it back easily to try to make it look better. n nI'm going to a place in Shadyside today to see if they can maybe do extensions to remedy the mullet look, or implement some kind of other cut to make it look a little better. It's a shame, because this place is downtown and so convenient to my workplace, but I certainly will not risk it again. n n ",1

"Went back even with all the choices in Vegas cause we had such a great experience the first time.

Really ? nThey took too long to make and slowed up the kitchen . Really ? nFirst don't tell someone clearly disappointment about a menu item they're a day late and charge me more if u can't make a profit . Also missing was taco sampler. nWhen food arrived my husband tacos looked like steak not chicken, we told waitress and she gave some speech about changing the marinade. nAfter another bite and further inspection they were clearly steak. nShe did not return to table until I have finished my meal to check back. She was over seated and obviously stressed out. nShe took the food , never offered to replace with correct food or anything.

"We waited a little bit to eat at this place so they could work out the kinks. We went on a Saturday night at 6p where it was pretty dead except for a few tables. Service was so slow and the food was way overpriced. Owner manager didn't even acknowledge staff kitchen was struggling, nor checked in with patrons to see if meals were okay once they arrived. It took about 30 mins just for apps. Our food was pretty good once it did finally come out but the overall experience and first impression was a disappointment. If you want authentic Korean BBQ this is not the place no hot pots or table side cooking . It's nice to have something unique in NoDa but I don't think this place is it.",1
"The food at Nandos is phenomenal. The portions and the size of the plate will fill you up guaranteed. I've only discovered this place a few months ago, but out of any Mexican restaurant I have visited, Nandos easily takes the number one spot of my favorite place to eat. Also, the service they provide is excellent. I have never had to call my waiter or waitress over to ask for a refill, and my requests for extra hot sauce was fulfilled the minute it was requested. n nThe prices are high when compared to the other Mexican restaurants I have visited, but if you come from 11 AM to 4 PM you can order the lunch specials, which I recommend big time.

Do not stay in the courtyard rooms whatever you do! I booked through a 3rd party website which did not describe these rooms accurately. They are in a detached building. The check in person was rude that I would only take a 1st floor room after finding out there is NO ELEVATOR for courtyard rooms. The room lacked good air conditioning desert must . I have seen larger showers in an RV. The sheet on the bed does not cover the mattress which is not hygienic. The maids don't leave the room doors open when cleaning the rooms. This is the first hotel I've seen allow this. Reading some of the other reviews people have had issues with items being stolen. The courtyard entrance is not secure only adding to the risks. It is always open and accessible from the street. n nThe Oyster Bar here is terrible. The Oyster Bar at Texas Station is top notch. If you find yourself staying here save yourself the wait and disappointment. Go to the Oyster Bar at Texas Station.,1
"It's hard being an associate at the Tanger Outlets because there is nothing to eat here but Subway. Subway these days is such a rip off. I got 3 slices of meat in my sandwich and I couldn't even taste it! The lettuce looks very old, all white and brown so I end up with spinach. The tomatoes are a weird light pink color. None of their vegetables ever look fresh. I asked for green bell peppers and I got 5 of the smallest slices ever. Worst sandwich I have ever had and it's sad that this is the only option for food. I highly recommend saving your money and never go there again",1
"Im out with my friend Sara and we have visited a few places prior in the evening looking for the best hangouts close to the light rail stops. We had drive this night and we parked across the street from Matadors and in front of Hanny's, a department store turned restaurant. Sara was already in the car when I turned around and peered into the window of the hip new lounge. There was no sign in the front and I had to ask the bartender what the name of the place was. A clean contemporary lounge with stainless steel and concrete mixed in with black leather that extrudes and odor reminiscent of its old department store days. I notice one of my favorite beverages on the back of the menu and order it without hesitation. This will be my fifth of the night, a Brazilian caipirinha, Sara orders a dry Chianti and a bar plate, prosciutto with fresh Parmesan and melon Ironic since she is a vegetarian. The music is a good mix of high energy, house and electronica with a little pop. The DJ was spinning and watching over the bar through an opening above the door like a war prisoner in his inaccessible cage. The bartender throws me a bone about the downstairs lounge that is open and draws a crowd for late night activities. Walking to the bathrooms upstairs was an adventure. On the way to the stairs is an opening with a glass floor that is about twenty feet above glass that reflects the glass twenty feet above my head and everything between. I'm drinking a very difficult drink to perfect, the mojito. With the caipirinha falling ever so slight on its mark in sugar department, I am giving the bartender another opportunity. And it's right on the money with the mojito. Sara is eager to get to the other 3 stops left in our night but its hard to leave the growing Sunday crowd and shiny objects that fill this new wonderland. We go upstairs and take our picture in the lighted mirrors before we leave. The bill was 36 bucks.",2

I'm not sure why. but I like this cafe over the one at the palazzo. It stay open 24 7 and the one in the palazzo close at 2am. The food is really good here and the price is decent. You know how food in Vegas is totally overpriced.My gfs and I came here plenty of times on our last trip bc it was convenient. I LOVE the ahi. we ordered this a couple times we were there. The buffalo wings is different and veryy gooood after a late night drunken partying. welll it was good overall. The crab cakes is VERY good . you have to try it! I really like the shaken beef. I was iffy at first because its a asian dish and this is an american place. but it was actually very good with a little twist. THey have such a big menu. which is always a plus! You can get anything from your regular american food to asian cuisine ,2

"Just had to commend BlackFinn and their staff for the quick and friendly and festive service during the DNC. While we didn't eat a meal here, we did have a couple of refreshing beverages during all the pre speech activities on Thursday. Needless to say, it was busy, but not overly packed inside the bar. While we stood at one of the hightop tables, a couple gentlemenly employees brought us over 2 stools! Impressive!

"Good drinks, good food. n nWhether its the pulled pork sandwich for which they have no problem giving extra sides of bbq sauce , the steak salad or tender short ribs, I have a seriously hard time not reordering the same things over and over. Every visit here I've tried something different and have yet to be disappointed. n nBTW, the housemade chips are light and crispy and go great with a dark and stormy or moscow mule. n nAside from the food, the service has always been accommodating. On one visit, we had barely 30 minutes to eat and drink in order to make a flight. Everything was rushed to our table asap despite the restaurant being full and as they were ready. We were in and out with time to spare. n nI can't wait for my next visit and to try something new.",2
"Would give a 4.5 if possible because there's always room for improvement. nBUT these dumplings were AMAZING! nVery flavourful, and a good selection. The menu is in 3 languages. Good service. nThe chili oil is a must try. They make it in store, with some on the counter you can buy to take home. n I got the steamed tofu and mixed veg dumplings nA in my books",2
"Who goes here?! At the ripe age of 21, this was my first ever club experience don't balk, I'm American . The horror! Who gave all those fifteen year old girls stripper heels and let them in the doors? There are much MUCH better places to go if you want to pay an unnecessarily high cover and watch people flop around on a dance floor.",1
Best sushi in all of Scottsdale!,2
"This place makes me angry. I've been here every month for the past five months.actually, it may be six. I've lost count. Anywho, I did buy my tires here along with the warranty. Every month my low tire indicator light comes on. Sometimes they try to convince me it has only to do with the weather, but assure me they will check everything out. Needless to say, every time they find something wrong with the SAME tire and proceed to ""fix "" it. And each month they PROMISE that it's fixed and I will NOT be in next month. Today I absolutely had it and told them I wanted a new tire and I got one the only reason they do not get one star . n nFor the most part, everybody here is friendly. Once I did wear a race shirt that says, ""Strip at Night "" on it it's referring to a marathon on the Las Vegas strip, which takes place at night and two workers at the register were snickering while one said, ""I like your shirt "". Felt like I was in high school again. Whatever, just fix my damn tire. n nI live within walking distance so I always drop my car off and ask them to call me when they are finished. Most of the time they don't call. n nNow for my absolute favorite story! Today I received a call about ten minutes after I dropped it off. The guy said my car would not start. I told him that you have to step on the brake and then push the start button. He snidely commented that he already did that ""AT LEAST 50 TIMES "". I thought he or his coworkers would know that so I understood if he felt slightly insulted. I told him I would come by later that afternoon with a friend who knew more about cars than me. n nI went to pick up my car, got inside, put the key in the ignition, put my foot on the brake, and pushed ""START "". Ummm it started right up. I saw the guy who was helping me earlier and I told him it started. He looked shocked and asked me how I did it. PERHAPS there was something that prevented it from starting four hours earlier.but I haven't ever had any problems with my car not starting and I think it was user error. n nI've gone to Discount Tire locations in the past and not had this problem. I will be moving on to another location after this! I'm sure they are just as relieved to hear that as I am saying it.",1
"I love chinese food. I LOVE bars. I was really excited to try this place today. First, let me compliment the staff. VERY NICE PEOPLE. GREAT SERVICE. n nSadly, The food blows. Blows may be strong. Its just beyond average. This place is like Panda Express but with a cool bar. n nI don't think you can call this place Gourmet Chinese.",1
I like this place a lot. The staff here are very friendly and make you feel comfortable. Not a lot of speaking to each other in another language so you can't understand what they're saying. nThey always do a good job too.,2
"While searching for an authentic French flavored Montreal dinner, my daughter and I arrived in a somewhat deserted Vieux Port section of town, hoping for a restaurant with lots of ambiance, for which Montreal is renown. Not sure why the area was so empty at 5 15pm perhaps it was due to the rather cold temperature, but I would think Montrealers are accustomed to that. We wandered along the quaint Rue St. Paul, with its fabled cobble street, and stumbled upon this cozy, corner restaurant, Marche de la Villette. The posted menu and pricing appealed to our appetite and budget, so we went inside, only to learn the kitchen was closed and that we could only order sandwiches. That was a little disappointing because I was really in the mood for the advertised crepes, but apparently they close at 6pm and needed all that time to clean up one can only imagine what they do in there to require all that time . n nSo, on account of being numb with cold, we ended up ordering the hot Toulouse sausage sandwich, which was served in wrapped red and white checkered paper, in a basket. Not fancy but still adequate enough for our taste. What the Marche lacks in pretense it more than made up for in ambiance. It's a very cozy dining experience. The tables are mostly tables for 2 yet are somewhat crowded together. They play nice French music, presumably from the Alpine region near Germany, as the music sounded almost a mesh of the two countries' varying folk styles. More importantly, the food was delicious. The sandwich was served on a fresh baguette with flavorful sauces, lettuce, and tomato it also includes pickles, though I asked for mine to be omitted . Our water was served in plastic cups. So, again, nothing fancy, but it was fine. We will definitely try to come back the next time in the city so that we can sample their crepes. n nAs for the service we received, it was very good. Our food only took a few minutes to prepare. French is their primary language, but both employees who helped us spoke some English and were friendly. Also, the overall pricing was moderate most dishes were between 7 14 . So, all in all, a thumbs up experience.",2
"I made a special trip to go to the Havana Cafe to buy food for my mother who was just put into hospice care. Imagine my surprise when I arrived at 3 30pm and was told that I could not order off the lunch menu because the kitchen was switching to dinner service. I pointed out that the front door has a sign stating lunch is served until 4pm. The hostess got the manager who refused to allow me to order off the lunch menu. I suggested they change their lunch hour to end at 3 30 instead of 4pm so this wouldn't happen to anyone else. As far as the food, I am Hispanic, and my food makes this food taste like fast food. I only went there for convenience. What a huge disappointment!",1
"I have heard that this place is really good. I thought we'd give it a try. We ordered a pizza, some wings and a few salads. You normally don't think salads will be good from a place like this but they were tasty as well! I will be ordering again. Seems like the workers love their job as well. Even the guys in the back!",2
"Okay so here's your review from a Chicagoan in town. I really wanted to like this place. Great name, great music playing and whoever designed the decor deserves a bonus. This place looks and sounds great. If I worked nearby this would be my local option for drinking. Staff are also pros and nice. Now let's get to the food. No joke, fire the chef. Not that the food is bad but it's just nothing specia i.e. bland. It sounds interesting but when it comes out you're like "" eh thats it? "" this place needs food that's WOW! to match the rest of the package. Also you need to up the craft brew count. For the record I had the rock shrimp appetizer aka plain ole fried shrimp. And the beef rib stew bland with very little meat and putting a fried egg on top didn't do much for the flavor either. Honestly the cornbread was the best part. Get a new chef and revamp the menu. Oh and they need a list of their hard liqour cause there's lots of bottles but only the bar manager knew what kind of scotch they had.",1
"How have I never been here?!?! This was the best meal I have had in and around charlotte in forever! All night long I just kept thinking ""wow! That was delicious!

Just because some random mexican place has a duck pond doesn't mean you should waste your time and money there.This place is way below average and I live in AZ but it's so gross and unsanitary at this resteraunt that I wouldn't waste your time and money here.,1
"Had great reviews and a coupon, so I tried Cu still. I went in on a Friday night around 7. Every table had a party seated. n nI order the baked and grilled wings, a scorpion burger with waffle fries, and a bacon avocado tomato grilled cheese sandwich with garlic fries. n nThe wings came charred black. After one wing I sent them back they were all crispy black. The waiter offered to have them redone correctly but that carcinogenic burnt taste in my mouth lingered for a long time an I was done with wings. n nBurger was a home made patty. Not medium but juicy. Small patty, there was plenty of just bun and lettuce bites to my burger. n nGrilled cheese came cold with some of the cheese not even melted. Not much bacon, especially for 8 , and I guess it was my mistake for thinking a mushy avocado would be good on grilled cheese. Completely missed the mark. n nGarlic fries were bleh. Not good. The waffle fries on the other hand were awesome. n nI really wanted to like this place. I had good service from my waiter Nick. Nice atmosphere with big booths. Maybe I'll give this place one more chance in a few months on a time when it's empty to get the mushroom burger and Phoenix sandwich which looked good, but not likely.",1
"Terribly terribly disappointing. WAY WAY WAY over priced. 62 yes sixty two dollars for myself and 3 small children to get in! The staff at the front did face painting clearly stating they took tips. Uh I'm going to pay you to paint a tiny pumpkin on my child's face that took you all of 10 seconds? Wow I'm clearly in the wrong line of work the guy even had the nerve to tell me there were places I could get money and he'd be here all day! No thank you! Oh admission also did NOT include train ride, or picking pumpkins and food started at 8 and sno cones were 5? A lot of it was run down dirty and very out of date signs broken, not well kept . for 62 we rode a roller coaster, swings, an airplane toddler ride, a trampoline and got lost in the corn maze. There were absolutely no signs in the maze to help families with small children we made our own path finally and ended up on a dirt road. I left with no pumpkins and very disappointed children. While my review will not stop anyone from going to Schnepf I will not return or support it as a small business, neither will I recommend it as a must see place . Save your money!",1
"After 2 3 chances, this restaurant has earned its one star. I think this has got to have one of the slowest service I've ever encountered! Forgetting little requests, not one refill, taking forever for the bill just plain checking up on the table. Do they have staff meetings while they're open? In addition, the food is not fresh tasting or appealing. Their spinach artichoke dip frozen dinner from Smith's is better. Makes me wonder how they keep their location in the Orleans?",1
"I'm glad many of you had decent experiences with Your Nail Gal Pam, and while I can give her credit for doing a fine shellac manicure or two, I am not one of her fans. Too bad, because she clearly knows her nail stuff. n nPeople stuff, not so much. I was dumb enough to go to Pam five times. What a grouchy technician her attitude made me feel terrible. n nLike Pam, I am a plus sized girl. She grimaced and complained when I got onto her pedicure throne, and got upset when I asked about having a gel pedicure. Frankly, the way her salon was set up made it a tight fit for her when doing my pedicure.but somehow that was my fault. n nDespite my being on time, neat and clean, always tipping well, and taking good care of my nails between visits, Pam never seemed happy to see me. n nMy last straw was when she cursed at me for not relaxing my leg muscles during a massage. Um, goodbye. I have no time, money or patience for being treated like the woman who ruined her life.",1
"We celebrated my husbands 50th birthday at Orange Sky this past weekend. We were impressed, our guests were impressed and the party was a huge success! n nWe pre ordered our wine and hor d'oeuvres and had a private server. The restaurant allowed us to decorate our area in advance and we even had a small private balcony. The bar and dance floor were just steps away and the band was a lot of fun. Between eating perfectly spiced crab cakes and tuna tartar we packed the dance floor. n nWe have enjoyed dinner here in the past but this was the first event we experienced here. I can tell you it won't be the last. Thank you to our wonderful server, the Chef, the Bartender and Cameo our planner. Your attention to detail and our satisfaction was evident.",2
The course I s in good shape . The greens look slow but are running around a 9 . The pace of plat was right at 4 hours but could have been 10 minutes faster.the cart girls were coming around every three holes. Drinks are a little on the expensive side . There is water available on the front and before the 10 th hole.there are numerous beautiful homes on the course. The sand traps did have rocks . The course is reasonably priced for the summer,2
Love this place! Employees are so friendly! Place is clean food is good. Love the pasta salad!,2
"I love this Lowe's, it is super organized and really clean and nice. I usually come to get flowers and plants for my yard. Yesterday, I needed a faucet. While I was there, I decided to check on carpet, my twins have been a little rough on the carpet in the living area and I wanted something that I can put for the next couple of years, until they grow up. They ride these ex rollers around, so I need something durable. Chris was very helpful, I was about to get a berber and he steered me clear from it. His suggestions made so much sense. I was so happy we were able to talk to him.",2
"Stayed here for a week as a perk of my job. n nHad a small spread of gourmet food buffet style food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the whole week. n nI loved their orzo salad and their incredible breakfasts. Eating breakfast outside on the patio is recommended. n nThe grounds are beautiful and overrun by adorable hares. They were everywhere! I also had the pleasure of spotting a couple turtles hanging out. n nHotel was very accommodating when I asked for my office chair to be replaced. They also brought in plenty of drinks and candy when I let them know I had a sweet tooth. n nI still miss the quiet walk to breakfast across the sweeping grounds as the sun was rising. Very peaceful way to start the day. n nIt's more than comfortable here.",2
"Have been here a few times over the past three years. It was never remarkable, in either way. I would say it was on par with Manzella's. Friendly staff, decent food, but not amazing. n n BUT n nWe had a gc and went to use it, not realizing the ownership had changed. BIG Improvement. The new owner claims that the recipes have not changed, but when I questioned this he said the only thing that they changed is that they have started using higher quality ingredients. n nOur table ordered Chicken Parm, Tortellini with Salsa Rosa mix of Marinara and Alfredo , Meat Lasagna, Italian Beef Sandwich, Chicken Marsala, Beef Ravioli, Clam Chowder, and Salads. The clam chowder was delicious much better than the previous pasty and thick version. The Marsala was also much better. In both dishes you could tell that it was more ""from scratch "" and flavorful with the addition of wine Marsala that didn't seem present before. The portions are mostly generous the lasagna was smaller than expected, my brother was still hungry after his salad, garlic bread, and lasagna, and he's not huge, 6'2 "", 185ish . My husband said the sandwich needed salt, and I would prefer no less herbs on the garlic bread, but overall, this was a much better experience. I would go back just for the soup!",2
"we loved our stay here. its about 10 minutes away from the actual strip, but we had a car and that was okay. n nwe ate in the buffet. they give you a coupon so it was a LOT cheaper. for food, we just drove down to the Jack in the Box about 2 blocks away. no crowds there. n n the employees at this hotel were ALL nice, never had one problem. we asked for a room at the end of the hall so that we wouldn't hear people coming down the hall. Nice and quiet. Beds and pillows were awesome, room was huge. View was of the parking structure, but i'm not there for the view. n nWe'll stay there again. They are already mailing us nights for free rooms!",2
"Seriously, what more could I ask for? I love Asian food, yet, I don't shop at Asian markets.until now. I am starting to cook more Asian dishes and I remembered my yelp friends suggesting this place. Thanks, friends! n nFirst of all, I was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of aisles of food, cooking items, and whole fish on ice. However, after I acclimated to the store I was able to find what I needed and my shopping basket became full quickly. If there was an item that I was unsure of or I couldn't locate, the woman behind the counter was very eager to help. By the way, if you are looking for chicken feet, pig heart, ox tail, or the like, you can find it here. n nI will definitely be going back to this place because they have everything at least what I need and I spent half of what I would have at any other main grocery store. I encourage you to bring your own bags as well.they were really appreciative that I did.",2
"The steak is delicious. Easily in category of the TOP 3 best steaks I've ever had. n n ""The Ultimate Steak "" platter, 120oz of steak for 250 DELICIOUS! The steak is cut into thin slices for your entire party to enjoy, so you don't have to worry about dividing it up. We had it medium rare and it came out PERFECT. Slightly bloody, juicy, and tender. Just writing this review makes me mouth water for it! n nWe had a party of 5 guys and 1 girl sharing this and we were all STUFFED w o any leftovers keep in mind 3 guys in my party were over 200 lbs . You can probably get away w 7 8 people sharing this monster. Plus for the price? 250 seems like a lot but split between 6 people is 40 a head. Score! n nSides nMacaroni Cheese Above average The Mac Cheese is delicious. It came out baked and was still crunchy I hate when it's creamy runny . Worth it. nCream Spinach Average Wasn't anything memorable, standard spinach. n nDessert nNY Style Cheesecake 10 Exceptional This is a delicious dessert! The cheesecake is rich thick. I was amazed w every bite I ate. nStrawberry baked Alaska 10 Average. Don't remember it being any memorable. I'd pass on this. nGrilled Banana Smores 10 Below average. This was ok, but wasn't anything special. You can buy all the stuff at home for half the price and it'll taste the same. I'd suggest asking for extra graham crackers tho. n nTIPS n Bread is complimentary UPON REQUEST. Ask for bread! It's delicious too. n Place turns into a lounge club at night.",2
"Yeah this place is god awful. I rarely shell out a one star rating but this place completely deserves it. n nFirstly, the food was terrible, we ordered eight items and not one of them was good. The food was simply tasteless. n nSecondly, in addition to being all around poor, it was way overpriced. One of the worst bangs for my buck that I've ever had. n nThe only good thing about the place were the fish tanks they have inside those are awesome. n nI have extreme difficulty understanding how anyone could even think of giving this place more than 2 stars it was HORRIBLE. n nSpend your money wisely go somewhere else when you're in Vegas.",1
"Kids, kids everywhere. The place is a huge daycare center. Pools always running some type of swimming class for kids. Basketball courts have daycare classes in them, the other side of the court mostly 11 year olds. I'll be avoiding this place.",1
"Great outdoors store that has just about everything.I have never bought anything here, but has been a great place to take people to sight see. I have even taken children here to check out the huge fish tanks, stuffed animals real ones and all the unique gear that goes along being a hunter, fisher, or outdoors type. n nI am sure the prices are not the best, but you go here for the huge selection of unique tools and equipment that is special to these recreational hobbies. nAnyways if I was an outdoors type, hunted, or fished, or just curious on taking up a new hobby this is a place to check out.",2
"My boyfriend took me here for our 1 year anniversary, and it was fantastic. We both love steak and were staying at the Mirage, which made getting dressed up to go out very easy! n nWe knew it would be pricey, but I know for the perfect steak it is worth the price. For every steakhouse I base my review on the cut of steak they started with, and how it is cooked. Some places start out with a bad cut of meat and still cook it right, and other places have a beautiful slab of meat that they absolutely destroy. And depending on the repuation of a place, I will order the rareness of my steak differently. n nWhen we had dinner at Stack, I took the risk and ordered my ribeye steak medium. It was called the Tomahawk steak with the bone in. When it came to the table, I was floored. it was a beautiful thick cut ribeye still attached to the full bone, which extended impressively off the plate about 12 "" or more! The presentation alone was magnificent. And then the taste was spot on. they used a type of herbed butter, but it did not take away from the taste at all. It was a perfect medium, not too rare and not overcooked. It is places like this that make me want a steak dinner every day! n nMy boyfriend ordered the fillet. and it was perfectly tender. almost like butter! I am so glad he shared a bite with me. n nWe also shared the asparagus with truffle hollandaise which complemented the steak perfectly. n nTo finish it all off, we had the creme brulee with cherries. it was fantastic! Again, the presentation was so fanciful, as it came in a thin swirly dish in the shape of a slender ""S. "" n nThey have a decent wine menu and are a must go steakhouse for whenever we return to Vegas!",2
"Went in there last weekend to purchase some watercolors! This place looks small from outside but is in fact pretty large inside. Did not have time to peruse throughout the store but will go there when I have more time again. n nThe watercolor selection is limited as in they do not carry a ton of different brands. The lady at the cashier stand was not very helpful nor was she friendly. It was a sunday and it looked like she really did not like being there. n nThey do carry different grains of watercolor paper which is great and I was helped by a nice gentleman with picking out some for me. He even pointed out the one that was a really good grain and was on sale that week. n nThe store is slightly unorganized as in the watercolors were in one section, the brushes were in a totally seperate section and then I couldn't find the watercolor paper anywhere until the associate helped me. They also have some books on different art subjects but again they too are unorganized. Some are near the seating area.right near the cashiers and then the rest are supposed to be on the far wall. Didn't have a chance to walk all the way over there. Did I mention, this place is huge. They also hold weekly watercolor and sketching classes at this place. n nAnyway, I will be making my future watercolor supplies purchases from Jerry's Artarama. It was easy to find and a basic no nonsense place.",2
"I like the fact that the Palazzo has this place on site as it is cool to see vegan smoothies and juices on the strip. However, in addition to being way overpriced, the service is not very good.",1
"I love this place. The pizza is great, very tasty, and has thin crust. The pizza is cooked in a brick oven, and doesn't take long to cook, so the food is ready soon after ordering. I love the taste, the service is good, the variety of ingredients is plenty, and the price isn't too high. And their lunch buffet is worth the price.",2
"Based on positive reviews here, we went to Coco in early evening on Saturday for dinner before going to a concert. The restaurant is attractive enough, the decor is pleasant. nThe menu is really such a disappointment in the first place, it appears to be just photocopies in plastic sleeves. kind of cheap, but not unseen if the menu changes frequently. I don't think that that is the case here. the hors d'ouevres consist of calamari, caesar salad, bruschetta, caprese. very standard stuff, very unimaginitive. We tried the caesar salad and the bruschetta. Nothing special at all. I think that the greens for the salad came from a bag. Croutons too, it tasted like. In fact, the menu was so uninspired that we left in order to see if we could do better for our dinner.",1
"Dr. Frye is great, but the office staff is the worse ever! They don't care at all. Sad the money we pay and the lack of servuce we don't receive! Don't watse your time or money here. ns",1
This place was awesome. The owners were very helpful and were engaging with the ALL of their customers. It appears like they love their job and it shows. You rarely see this these days. The food was amazing as well. I can't wait to find an excuse to be on that side of town again so I can enjoy their tasty food!,2
"Without a doubt the best cinema I have ever been to! n nI recently had the opportunity to purchase 2 tickets to see any film at the Dominion for a heavily discounted price, including a drink each and a tub of Pringles. Although the cinema is slightly out of my way, having usually settling for the Vue in the center of town, I thought this an opportunity I couldn't miss! nAs soon as I walked through the door I could instantly see the beauty of such an old and homely venue. The entrance was lovely and staff at the reception were welcoming and friendly. All of the pictures taken with actors actresses and directors lining the walls on the way to the screens really add to the old school cinema experience. It was really a treat to sit on the comfy two seater couches and put our feet up, and it made a change from the extremely busy and expensive Vue. Even though it is slightly further away I will be journeying back just for the comfort and relaxed atmosphere. nIt's like watching films in your home but on a much larger screen D",2
Well a Bone In Ribeye for 144. Not acceptable in my book. I own a very busy restaurant and I would not dare to charge this price. The quality was good but nothing to justify the price. Sorry we will not return.,1
"This place was OK, not bad. I took my brother and his wife here on his birthday. he likes this place better than I do, but hey, Happy Birthday, Chris! n nFood was good. Ambience pretty nice. it was a comfortably warm summer night, so it was kind of like we were at a seaside restaurant I don't really know why else I would think that . Only one reservation about this place. Our dweeb waiter was rather obnoxious. He kept asking questions that seemed a little personal. um, just bring us our food ,dumbbell. n nAnyway, good food, nice atmosphere, enjoyable evening. Recommended.",2
Very expensive burger be sure to ask for a table not in the back near the waiters station even when there are no other customers no coke just Pepsi soft drinks by the bottle Hey it's Vegas,1
"Although I didn't know it, I've been living under a rock for what must be ages because I had never heard anything about Fate. All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office. n nWell played. n nI wish I could say the same about Fate. n nMy dining partner who is obviously in on the scheme as well had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. n nWe didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations aside from the wicked Buddah head were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, ""Fate. "" n nI really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. n nAfter entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good. n nThe waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. n nAfter paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate. n nThey were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. n nIt tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, ""I'm never coming back here again. "" To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard. n nFate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review. I'll just have to find someone else to enjoy it with.",1
"Considering the fact that we have a group of family, that come here to LV yearly, I've always enjoyed staying at one of the Strip Resorts and walking to the TOWN SQUARE CBTL, as a form of exercise and relaxation. No longer. n n There is a particular male barista he's been there for several years whose attitude, along with yes, the ever increasing high prices, have driven me away from this particular location. He is extremely condescending. n n You have a sign posted suggesting that we ""ask "" to try your newest Pumpkin Latte hot, iced or blended . I figured that since there had been two folks ahead of us and no one behind us, why not ask to try them which we did, as we'd placed our original orders. n n After receiving our drinks of which my large hot Chia Tea Latte was only lukewarm at a 5.50 hot price, of which I tolerated, I inquired where the sample Pumpkin Lattes were. The ""stale "" male barista simply answered that he was moving as fast as he could but that he had to take care of the other patrons drinks first at which time another patron or two had walked into the establishment . I chose at that point to simply walk out, as my interaction with that ""non social "" barista made me remember that he'd been equally rude on my previous visit from last year. n n My suggestion would be to take your sample sign down and don't put it back up again, as clearly your ""non social "" barista moves at his own slow pace, which is assisting in driving your customers away and causing you to have to raise prices. n nPeace out !",1
"If you're ever in the mood for some wings 3am in the morning and want to avoid the strip or crowded Hooters Hotel, this is the place to chill and have a very late night wings wit friends. Fortunately I live in the southwest side of Vegas, so this location isn't really far from where I live. n nThis late at night you just walk in and seat yourself. There are no waitresses on shift this late at night so for the drunk pervs, sorry but you might have to get your booty shorts fix somewhere else. The bar area is the best place to if you want to be attended to right away since its the bartender basically doing everything this late. If you decide to sit at one of the tables, you might find yourself constantly getting up just to waive him down for simple things such as refills. n nWings here we're still the same price though so don't be fooled and think its 25 cents per wings past midnight like the one in Hooters Hotel.",2
"This is a great park that overlooks the I 515 I 215 interchange. It has connections to the Union Pacific Railroad Trail, and a dog park. It also has a nice looking baseball field, soccer field, and a tennis court that is lit at night. n nBut if you have a 3 year old this place has a pretty enjoyable playground and a small water area that makes for a lot of fun on a summer day. A small shelter house with concrete picnic tables gives you a place to setup for a small picnic lunch, or if you go after dark the play area and shelter house was pretty well lit up and we felt safe here. . n nOverall Acacia is just another reason why I like living in Henderson.",2
"I love JJ definitely my choice over other chain sub shops, employees are pretty friendly and service is fast. Wish they delivered by our place! Only complaint is that is you want peppers on your sub you have to pay extra and there isn't much on the subs already so I think that's unnessary. Other than that two thumbs up.",2
"The duck salad was spot on. In the crab enchillada, the rich sauce over powered the flavor of the crab. The food portions are surprisingly large. n nAnd if size matters to you, the wine list is HUGE.",2
"My wife and I saw The Avett Brothers there on 5 27 11 and it was our first time going to a show there. I loved the outdoor intimacy.it is like a small Blossom Music Center, but in Downtown Pittsburgh. The beer was expensive, but the show made up for it. I recommend it, but I am not sure how a show would be during the winter months, inside of the venue. Try it out for a summer show and you won't be dissapointed.",2
"Steve and Justin were super accommodating! I had to cancel on them the first time I made an appointment, but it wasn't a problem for them and they made rescheduling easy. They showed up on time, and even though some of the aspects of the job were tricky because my house is older, they handled it with a single trip to the hardware store. Everything was done quickly and to a very high level! I am thrilled and will be using Red Truck for all of my handyman needs in the future!",2

"I think I'm one of the few people who just doesn't care for Earls, and thats probably considering that I'm vegetarian, and they have only 2 sandwich options. n nI've been here plenty of times and I loved their vegetarian sandwich that was stuffed with feta cheese, veggies, balsamic etc. It was delicious! However, I remember going back and they had taken the sandwich off the menu. I was bummed and when I asked them for a different option, they said the only sandwich they had was the caprese. I wasn't feeling it, and I asked if they would mind making me something else, they said they couldn't. THAT MAKES NO SENSE. I just wanted a sandwich stuffed with veggies, cheese, etc. but they said that wasn't allowed. I was so furious, considering I waited in such a long line and I was starving. n nComing here this past weekend. I saw that they added another veggie option to their menu, I was stoked to try it, however when I arrived to the front of the line, the cashier said they had run out. When I asked if they could make me something else, they once again denied this request. n nI suggest they step up their service offer more vegetarian options. n nBTW the two stars are for their sandwich bread. Its just so good.",1
"Overall I'm quite happy with my membership here. I paid for 2 years upfront and received a 3rd year free. I also got one add on of 2 passes per month with this package. n nThey really sell you on the classes but what they don't tell you is how crowded some of them can be. I enjoy the energy of a full class but I don't like it when there isn't enough space to move. Best time to go to a class is from 10am to 5pm weekdays if you can. n nChristina is one of my favorite Body Pump class teachers. She's teaches a number of other classes too. If you're into yoga, they offer it here, but the environment is not super soothing since you have a lot of ambient gym noises like weights being dropped on the ground in the room upstairs.",2
"Back open for lunch?! Thank you! n nI will definitely be in to visit this gem and test it out again. I loved the burgers there, applewood smoked and with avocado! Can't wait to write a proper current review for this place n nI love the salsa here, blended and served hot! It's probably the best salsa ever!",2
"I've had comparably delicious and authentic Afghan food on the South Shore for much less, but then their atmosphere, ambiance and location can't come close to Khyber pass, whose interior decor and summer patio are a delight. Service is always attentive and the food spiced wonderfully, the different courses blending melodiously together.",2
"I love my Mexican food but I don't love overpriced Mexican food. n nRecently on a Vegas trip with some girl friends, we stayed at the Luxor. As we were still recovering from the night before, we decided to make dinner easy and just head downstairs to T T. I understand that we were on The Strip in Vegas but 13 before tax and tip for a chicken quesadilla is pretty ridiculous. There was nothing special about it and I only ate about half before I couldn't choke down any more cheese. n nThe chips and salsa were slightly better but I would have preferred a traditional red salsa instead of the green salsa and the chipotle I think? salsa. n nI'll save a few bucks and pass on T T in the future.",1
"Love this place. The food could be a notch better for instance, not using those crappy, over breaded, packaged, frozen cheese curds but the burgers are outstanding and the breakfast menu is solid. A few things could use a touch more flavor, but overall, better than most places.",2
"Arrgh, just when I kicked my Chipotle habit, this place comes along. Some great tortilla soup, custom made enchiladas that come out of the oven piping hot. Why didn't some one come up with this earlier? My biggest gripe is the parking lot, not the easiest to negotiate a little parking lot on 7th street during prime rush hour but worth it. Oh they have great snickerdoodle and Mexican wedding cookies for purchase right at the counter!",2

"I have been to the DD many times. They host the annual Derby Wedding during RollerCon which is truly a sight to behold! nI love that they have pool tables and typical garage type bands here. nIt can get very loud and very crowded but that just makes it that much more fun! nNever tried the bacon martini but have tried the ass juice and its tastes like it sounds.but its their trademark so you gotta indulge. It wont kill ya but you will feel as if your dying. nCheck out the girls bathroom.a huge mural dedicated to the derby girls.love that! nCheap drinks, music,pool tables! Love that the most!",2
"Oh, this review breaks my heart. I am so disappointed. n nWhoever decided to close down their wonderful little original store and move into this ridiculously tiny hovel needs to be sent to detention for the rest of the school year. And the next seven years after that. And perhaps a lifelong membership after that. n nThey've moved into a teeny, tiny little place that I'd say 85 90 of their original content is no longer there. Gone are the cheeses and pates. The cookbooks and the great majority of all their wine plates and trinkets. n nAll the charm is gone. The wine selection is greatly diminished from what it used to be. With everything else missing, it's lost everything that made the place great. But I found at least one bottle of wine that I liked. Not that it was hard to do in such a tiny little rack that now makes up their selection. It's like a casino convenience store now. n nI can only guess financial reasons, or someone in the Paris made them move, but the end result is depressing. I can't believe that they could justify doing something so foolishly reckless to such a wonderful little place. n nChanging up La Cave like this is the ""New Coke "" of bad brand decisions Pointless and awful. But Coca Cola eventually came to their senses and went back to their original ways. I sincerely hope La Cave will do the same.",1
"I wish I'd come here when I first moved out to Vegas! I first saw it on Man v. Food and dragged the bf here to try it because I had a list of places I wanted to eat at before I move back to Cali. n nWe split the Chorizo Hash and the Snickers pancake. No joke, the pancake was bigger than my head. We seriously had 2 days worth of leftovers. The food was great, but left us wanting a tiny bit more. We liked the atmosphere and the funny thing is, the day we went, there were tons of celeb impersonators from Imperial Palace because they were announcing their new location at the Imperial Palace that day in a sort of press conference. So it was extremely loud and the entertainers were performing the whole time we ate. That was a fun bonus for me n nTo drink, we had a mint mocha and a Smores mocha.both extremely yummy. I'll miss it when I move but I know it'll be successful enough to still be open anytime I visit ",2
"Food and service are average quality. Dining in offers very little ambiance, but it works for decent take out.",1
"This restaurant has replaced the Wolfgang Puck Bistro that recently closed. nI'm being gracious here with 2 stars. The first time I went last week, the service was extremely slow. He swiped my credit card and finally handed me my receipt 20 minutes later. It took him 15 minutes to come to me and apologize, but even then, he didn't tell me what was going on. He kept walking back and forth and talking on the phone with someone, because the computer was not cooperating. nThe interior of the place is nice though, with flat screen TVs on the sports channel and nice bar to sit at. The other workers there seemed to be having a good time as well. nThe food was bleh. I had the Baked Feta and Marinara starter, which was basically garlic bread with a huge bowl of marinara sauce mixed with feta cheese. Also, they gave me the wrong order. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, and when I got home, I opened up a chicken bacon ranch wrap. Oh well! Thumbs down to this place. If I go back, it will be just to see if their pizza is any better.",1
"BEWARE and stay away. n n Beware The extra fees and added charges add up big time. Resort fees, 18 mandatory gratuity on all purchases at poolside even for drinks ordered at the bar itself, wi fi for a limited number of devices 2 per room and charges after that, etc. etc. n n Beware Make sure you know what you bought. If you bought a package make sure you know what you are supposed to get WHEN YOU CHECK IN. Movie tickets, bowling coupons, meal credits among some of the items. If you don't ask you might not get them at all. n n Beware they are not going to tell you that they are doing major construction to the pool area. If you are looking at the fantastic pictures of the pool and are dreaming of a relaxing time there be prepared to listen to constant masonry grinding all day long. Yes, all day. The pool opens ed at 9 00 and the noise went until after 4 00. The construction noises drowned out the overhead music and the fountain. n n Beware staff indifference and ignorance The poolside hostess just shrugged her shoulders and said, 'oh, talk to the manager.' The clerk at the front desk did not even know they have been working on the pool ALL WEEK. No manager on duty 'in a staff meeting'. conveniently. The Front desk clerk took my phone number and said the Manager K would call me to discuss. did not. n n Beware Food credits apparently have many stipulations. They cannot be aggregated by multiple rooms , cannot be used at certain restaurants, etc. n nThis 'resort' has a LOT of work to do if they want to act like a real resort. VERY disappointed, will not return.",1
"Went in for the first time today for an eyebrow and lip wax. Betty was sweet and friendly at the front desk and my waxer, Alaina was well mannered, informative and answered all my questions. She recommended the Restore It product to regrow my overly plucked eyebrows. We'll see how that goes! Overall it was a great experience and my eyebrows and lip looks great! I will definitely be returning! The only downside is that I felt like I was having product pushed on me and that made me a bit uncomfortable but I know everyone has a quota to fill.",2
"This place sucks. I went a few years ago, so if I go back, I'll provde an update. One of my friends made a big deal about it so we gave in and went. Big disappointment. The ambiance is great and refelective of the Asian vibe, but as a club, it sucked. It was more to me a place where you go to be seen, you know, a place that you brag about being at to all your friends. I wasn't impressesd. I don't care how many celebrities party here, the club was still wack.",1
"My jerk chicken was not as flavorful as it should be, and I prefer heavy gravy, and this was dry. It seemed as if it weren't marinated and all the flavor was right at the surface, just from the spice rub. The breast meat was fairly dry. The peas and rice, despite asking for extra gravy, were almost completely dry as well. They didn't have any braised cabbage, which I would consider to be a staple at a Jamaican place. n nI guess I would go again and try the oxtails, but only if I were already in the neighborhood. I'm forever spoiled by Caribbean Citchen in Detroit.",1
"Abay is amazing, and I'm a bit snobby about food. Highly recommend Ayib Be Gomen and Gomen Besiga beef garlic greens . The tea is amazing too. We ate until we were stuffed. MMMMM",2
Dined here with my husbdand while spending a few days in las vegas. The meals were actually pretty good but not worth the insane prices at all. If the prices were more reasonable I'd give a better rating but I've had much better for much less. Overated! Have dinner at zeffrinos in the venetian instead . now thats a restauranyt where you'll get your moeny's worth!,1
"i am SO disappointed in Reflections, it's in fact very sad. when i first moved into my beautiful apartment January of 2013 , with granite counter tops and an enormous kitchen i was in heavenly bliss. they were in the process of just finishing up renovations, with a gorgeous pool house, sauna, gym, Jacuzzis.the works, and for the first year and a half i LOVED it here. granted there were some issues of the gates never being fixed, and continuously standing ajar for the whole city to come and go as they please, yet i still felt safe, and the management and workers here were great, always friendly, on the ball, and getting things done when they were needed to be done. then the managerial changes occurred. Jada a good manager, was replaced by Ryan a GREAT manager, some amazing staff members were relocated to other complexes, and other new, albeit competent were brought in, no problem. then they started firing all the great new lease agents, keeping the incompetent ones, and hiring people who barely lasted a month. finally Ryan left, followed by Stephanie and Trinity brought in a slew of rude, incompetent imbeciles who can barely sign their own name without using spell check, and all this for a tremendous hefty height in rent. my lease was up back in August, and personally as much as i love living here, i was worried about being able to afford the rent increase, but i stuck it out and asked them to renew my lease, the lease renewal was unfortunately being done during their new incompetent hires. back in June, when i first requested a lease renewal, i didn't give it a second thought. yet 3 weeks later in the beginning of July, when i have still not received one, i was getting a little anxious, as the buildings policy is, if you do not sign a renewal lease, then you pay a month to month with a penalty of an additional 100.00 per month, which would be added to the rent increase, making the rent of a one bedroom apartment at close to 1000.00 trust me, far from worth it . after talking to one of the new hires, Courtney, i asked for a lease renewal, she gave me a fake smile, tried to hide her rudeness, didn't bother writing my info down, and said she'll have one ready by the end of the week. needless to say, and to make a long story short due to space, it took them up to up to TWO DAYS before my lease was up, and they STILL didn't have a lease ready for me, it was only with my raising my voice, and raising holy hell that they said they would get right on it. on August the first i STILL didn't hear anything form them, so i called to find out was going on they said, they were waiting for my home insurance info, so i asked if they called the insurance company they said they didn't, so i asked how were they planning to get the insurance info, they said i was supposed to get it to them, i asked if they contacted me for the info, again they said no. so i questioned how were they planning to get info if they never bothered to ask anyone for it? Courtney just gave me a vacant look like she didn't understand what i was even talking about, and said ""i don't know "". that is how their leasing agents ""work "", now lets talk about the grounds. because of the bug infestation here, the pools, and the jacuzzis, when the jets and heat aren't broken, are uninhabitable because i have an issue of doing the breaststroke, with a cockroach doing the backstroke along side of me trying to keep up. the pools and jacuzzis again when they are working, which in fact is quite rare are usually filthy with dirt, grime, leaves and bugs.lots and LOTS of bugs. even the main house has an ant infestation in the kitchenette area. they claim they spray weekly, but when you see a parade of ants, all over the coffee machine, you tend to wonder if they are spraying with pesticide or water? the little refrigerator that is to house water for the residents is void of water, but now filled with employee left over lunches, going back who knows how long. the dog fecal matter is lying petrified outside my building, so they can claim that they clean it up every morning all they want, but i don't know of a single dog who has WHITE poo. and don't even get me started on the bird dropping on the stairway, because the area is such a delicatessen for them because of the bugs. the AC in the gym has been broken for ages, and when i told them about it, they said they had someone take a look at it but it was fine 86 degrees is NOT fine . there are fights and arguments in the parking areas, people blast their music from their cars at all hours of the night, there was even a shooting here. this place has gone to holy hell, and i can't wait for my lease to expire, because this time, no matter how much i love my kitchen, the filth and low class of tenants and management that they brought in are far from worth it, especially for the price they charge.",1
"Yep, 2.5 stars is about right. The best thing about this 24hr joint is the design. Oh my God is it a feast for the eyes. I mean if you're going to shell out for some meh late night food, it might as well be in the swankiest place right? Service was good, but the food.not so much. Overpriced? You bet.",1
"I rated this a two on basically the bad service. The food is not worth the price but the portions are a good amount. I got the spicy chicken which was really spicy. I would share with someone n nI tried my friends ""Cold Soup "" they bring it out with ice in it. Very interesting never had soup that was brought out cold. It had no flavor to it and eating ice cold soup is just too weird for me. Nasty, I wouldn't order it. n nIts also nice because this place is open late night because everything taste good when you're drunk so if you're craving korean bbq after the club I would come here . It's convenient and right off the strip. n nThe only nice thing is they asked our party of 10 if we wanted separate checks so paying the bill made it very easy. n nBut overall nservice sucks nfood ain't worth the price 26 for spicy chicken. Tax tip included nonly good for late night drunkin food",1
I'm giving it 5 Stars based on the classification 'dive bar.' It is a great dive bar and worth the trip just to see it. The prices are outstanding from what you'll experience further up the street in Southside. n nStop by check it out if you are going out for a low key night in Southside.you'll be posting on Yelp later on that for a dive bar it is all you can ask for. n nMake sure you 'sign in' while you are there.,2
This is by far the worst ER I have ever been to the staff is lazy and they have very poor work habits I came in at night thinking I wouldn't be in their that long i was their for 6 hours and my doctors didnt do anything to help my pain besides Providing me medication that took me 6 hours the ppl is weird it's police walking thru with k9 dogs it's just crazy I hope I never have to go bk to this place o yea and the housekeeping is old and look like crack heads,1
"A basic burger, add overpriced because it is vegas. n nThen for good measure throw in some snobbish hostess types at the front of the restaurant and you have a recipe for annoyance. n nI have had just as good at Red Robin, so not a ""must visit "" place.",1
"Even though they lost our reservation and were crowded, they served us well with great food, Braised Short Ribs were outstanding, with three different pasta dishes just plain SUPER!",2
"Sweet Potato fries are outa sight and they do their FEZ burgur just right. They're the CenPho hot spot for lunch, dinner and late night! n n nI've had their burgers, pita pizzas, and salads. The atmosphere is cool and eclectic and the staff is friendly. Order yourself a flavorful martini with a few to choose from, like their raspberry feztini always a great choice. Check them out if you're in the CenPho area and deciding where to dine, you won't be disappointed.",2
Only Pizza Place opened on Easter Sunday for lunch. Good Pizza nice staff very clean. Apps came out cold but they fixxed it with no questions. I would come back again. Pizza is very good and affordable.,2
"Went from bummed to furious. I got the bier brat sandwich which was decent. My s o got the Nuernberger Bratwuerst, which also tasted good. Menu said the latter was 12.99, was charged 17.50. Ordered German Potato salad and received normal potato salad, Told the waiter it wasnt what what we expected and were still charged for it. Some gal, assuming the manager, came up and explained why we were wrong and that the recipe that was used has been in her family for generations. I will NEVER be dining at this location again and will ABSOLUTELY be telling everyone I know to avoid it. I would give 0 stars if possible. Overcharged and poor customer service from what should have been a neat little restuarant.",1
"Everything about the meal was excellent. I ordered the surf and turf which was amazing and my date ordered 2 pounds yes, TWO pounds! of crablegs and oyster shooters. Everything tasted absolutely amazing. Service was amazing. Atmosphere great. Definitely 5 stars, nothing to complain about. n nTip Be prepared to drop some though! Well worth it though!",2
"stayed for one friday night. the rooms are very roomy! all the rooms are suites. it's not far from the strip. you could walk there if you wanted to. would definitely come back. parking was slightly inconvenient.didnt know we would have to drive to different complexes to get to our hotel. we lugged all our stuff in, only to find out we'd have to drive allllll the way around the building to get to our hotel room. so lugged allllll our stuff back into the car after we checked in and did that. the concierge was difficult to understand, cuz of his accent and i felt he thought i was lying about having a reservation.wtf? i may be wrong for feeling this way, but i did. nso the room.stayed in room d306. they have the bulky tvs. havent upgraded to flat screens yet. our shower door was hard to open! we had to fight with it a couple of times. the shower heads are like the ones at MGM. nwe ordered extra towels and they arrived 2 hours after we called for them. also.when we ordered pizza.it didnt arrive for OVER AN HOUR! redonkuloussss if u ask me. nwell.we checked out of the room around noonish over the phone and my friend and i sat in front of our hotel room waiting for our friends to come back with the other hotel room keys so we could stash our stuff in their room temporarily and we started hearing noises. the sounds were coming from room D306. sounded like something was scratching at the carpet. and intermittently.the door handle would sound like it was trying to open from the inside. my friend then tells me last night she felt like something was standing there watching her. she thought it was one of our friends.but then later thought it was something else. nanyhoo.don't know if it's haunted.but that freaked us out and by that time after we realized that the place may be haunted.we were BEGGIN our friends to come back. nso i give them 2 stars because it's a decent hotel. not as nice as the ones of the strip. but hey, you get what you pay for in this case i didnt pay, but i know the cost of the room . service was slow. price was good. very close to strip. confusing parking depends on which building you are in . latest check out is 12p. nAll in all, i would come back.its much better than other places ive stayed and i can fit a buncha friends in the suites. just need air or pull in beds!",1
Watch out for extra charges that should not be there in your final bill. An extra hour charge or fuel charge when you fueled it up.,1

We've eaten at the Grand Wok about four times. This last trip to Vegas we went for dinner. We weren't impressed with our choices. Don't order the Orange Chicken! The Spicy Tuna Roll was good. Service can definitely be improved. The place is pretty pricey. Stick to sushi dishes and you'll be ok.,1
"50 off all pastries near closing time! n nWe were waiting for a table at Sushi Mon next door when we stumbled upon Caked. We really wanted to buy more, but we knew we were going to eat a lot during the weekend so my friends and I held ourselves back. Although it was really hard when the lady told us everything was 50 off because I was so intrigued by mango and guava cupcakes! n nWe ended up with a blueberry muffin, a chocolate almond croissant and a breakfast turnover. I didn't end up eating the muffin and the croissant until 2 days later but they were both delicious. Especially warmed up on the microwave. The turnover had egg, cheese and bacon and it was very filling. The outside crust was nice and buttery too. The muffin was soft and very moist. Very good! n nWe were so tempted to buy a box of six day old cupcakes for 6. Each a different flavor. But we held back. Kind of regret now after trying the other pastries!",2
"HOLY MOLEY. n I remember seeing Matsuri back in '07 '08 at the Sahara. Can I just say that they are AMAZING! Not only are they Japanese Olympians Athletes, these people are ENTERTAINING as hell!

Great for ALL ages. n nThis show topped the many shows that my boyfriend and I saw, including the Cirque's, hands down. But that's just our opinion ",2
"Great little place to have breakfast brunch! Food was delicious. I had a smoked salmon omelette, and she had a 2 egg breakfast. Very tasty and decent portions. nStaff was VERY friendly and was happy to speak with us in English not always a given when in Montreal . n nPricing was also very good for the dishes received. n nThis is a small mom pop type shop, so decor was very minimal down to earth, not fancy, but well maintained and clean.",2
"We came here our first night in Vegas and had a blast! n nThe cover to get I'm was cheap, only 10. The music they played was a a lot of fun, the girls dancing had a lot of energy! n nThe only bummer was that there weren't a lot of people dancing. Aside from a few here and there most were lining the outside of the floor. We had no problem being in the middle though! n nDrinks were expensive but hey, you're in Vegas.",2
"I lived in Miami for a large portion of my life and grew up eating Cuban food at home being as my family is Cuban , and was really excited to find a Cuban restaurant in Arizona. However, I was not as thrilled after trying the place. We had the croquetas de jamon and fried yuca for appetizer. Neither one met expectations and were not traditional. The croquetas had a good filling, but the outside was not traditional and had no flavor. The fried yuca had so much garlic it covered the taste of the yuca which if you haven't had before is very mild . We had picadillo and the ropa vieja for our main meals. The ropa vieja was great, but the picadillo was very soupy and you could barely tell the texture of the meat a little odd . Last, they food takes forever! Cuban food isn't exactly something that you whip up in five minutes, but it should come with a warning because after appetizers we ran out of conversation we were waiting so long. If you've never had Cuban food before you might love this place, but if you grew up eating it like I did, you'll still be missing home.",1
"My car was overheating and the closest place I could think to take it was this Pep Boys. Let's make a long story short.they quoted me almost 700 because ""all of my hoses needed to be replaced "" along with my thermostat and a coolant flush. Not to mention they were going to charge me EXTRA for a warranty on the parts which is absolutely ludicrous. After talking to a trusted mechanic who doesn't live in AZ I took it for a second opinion to Shadow Mountain Auto Service. It was a bit of a drive but I made it. After all, they're yelp reviews are nothing but raving fans. A trusted, hard working, friendly auto business. Not only did they quote me 300 less than Pep Boys but they told me they couldn't find anything wrong with my hoses.

I do not see the allure. We got a big box of the mini sized brownies in a variety of flavors 100 120 a pop and I tried the walnut. Not great. Kinda dry. n nSo I waited a bit and tried the original. Just as dry and no walnuts. n nSkip it.,1
I already don't like buffets so when I came here after having to wait in line for 40 mins I was seriously disappointed. Most of the food was just standard fare with some of the Middle Eastern stuff being interesting. Unlike the Bellagio where I ate until I felt like my stomach would pop I ate very sparingly here. n nThe only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness and take pics so he could get hitched with his girl that nite. while I was trying to get some lamb chops. it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.,1
"Very poor service for an expensive meal! Portions are small for what they say feeds 2 or more. Waited forever for service. Was not offered bread, had to ask. Food was not what I am accustomed to at our local Italian place. Very below par. Do not get calamari, rubbery and again small portion for 10.99. Oh yeah, the place is filthy! Skip this one! Better off saving a few bucks and enjoying your meal at Olive Garden!",1
"I don't really understand all the hype about this bakery. First time we got cupcakes here was on our way to Mt. Charleston last winter, and the cupcakes were just very blah to me. Since we live on the other side of town from retro bakery, there really was no reason to drive up all the way just to try another batch of cupcakes since the first time was just mediocre. We found ourselves on this part of town yesterday since we needed to go to centennial toyota, and I decided to give retro bakery another shot. We bought the retro cupcake, coffee and donut, and the pumpkin spice, and boy, were we just disappointed as last time. As many others have stated, the frosting was too sweet, all you can really taste is the sugar and a hint of coffee flavoring at the end, same goes with the pumpkin cupcake. The cake part was just too bland. It almost tastes like those boxed cake mixes you can buy at the groceries. Not impressed at all. Only saving grace was the service as both girls in the counter were very helpful and friendly. Go ahead and stop by if you're in the area, but not worth traveling to in my opinion.",1

Finally awake early enough to try this place so I sent the old man out on this cloudy day to go fetch me some donuts. While he arrived after 10 which is really late on a Sat to get donuts duh he did come back w my goodies! They even took a tray of glazed donuts to the back to throw some maple on for the kid! That's going that extra mile if you ask me! You know the donuts you get at Bashas or Albs that are more like wax tasting than anything? Well these are the opposite and I couldn't stop eating them! Sooo good and I'm excited it's around the corner from me! Next time I go earlier so I can try them all! Two thumbs up!,2

Further, the owners dog was running all over the store. I have extreme allergies and found this beyond irritating.

When one of your menu offerings is Clam Chowder, you should never run out of crackers! Lastly, my side was chips and salsa. I received a half full ramekin of salsa that lasted 4 chips.

"My boyfriend and I stopped by Pop Up Pizza after we became hungry after a long day night of drinking. Pop Up Pizza is conveniently located inside of The Plaza Hotel which is a short walk from the Golden Nugget where we were staying.

"I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER. that is right. it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice. just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer. now, you might be thinking, ""Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers? "" and to that I say, ""Fuck you. "" n nSo anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege. It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat. Delicious. While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under 10 he will be all, ""HIGH FIVE! "" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's RIP for 99 cents and the man shed a tear. HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD so we were in a cab faster than you can say, ""faux chicken chow mein. "" Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, ""Because this one's a VEGAN! Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed. Good one, you guys! It IS hilarious when someone is vegan! HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR. n nwe pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed. GODDAMMIT. we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular. We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets. Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I ""forgot "" mine, you dig? I ain't paying when money bags is around! I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up. Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW! and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET! do you think it comes in pink? n nWe take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another 100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato. The cab is 45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is 70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening. You're saying to yourself, ""Who gives a fuck, Laura? "" And to that I say, ""Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review. "" n nWe walk into Merkato and are the only non Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded. Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness. I order the veggie combo which was a very typical veggie combo yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc and it was MAGNIFICENT. One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT. my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle. now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan. i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat. tendons and gristle and marrow.i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef. i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year old until i figured out i was eating bambi. ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment. n nSo, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in that's how they roll in Ethiopia. Slowly. But friendly. Like this review. and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the 30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him 115 tip. MY DAD'S BAD! we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, ""hold on "" and disappears. two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel. Major bonus. n nIn the end, we're dealing with n nCab rides 135. nDinner 25 for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea nAverage Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip 200. n nSo anyway, I think we still did good.

As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man Yasin! Holla! wins tonight! I love my dad. n nI am finally done, you can rest your eyes.

"Until today, I've never written a review for a restaurant, whether the restaurant was fantastic or average. Usually, I just communicate my sentiments regarding the restaurant via word of mouth. However, this restaurant deserves time expended for a review. The food was detestable and has no connection to fine dining or even the most moderate fine dining experience. The seafood was all previously frozen and much to my chagrin, the crab used for the crab cakes had a brown hue, the shrimp were overcooked and the oyster was spoiled. The ambiance of the restaurant is rather drab and the wallpaper was frightening. The market should not allow for such poor food and service. The restaurant is unworthy of it's Mt. Washington view. In fact, a bologna sandwich has more relation to fine dining than this restaurant does. They should hang a sign from the restaurant that reads, ""Buyer Beware. """,1
"I went to meet my mother here for lunch she is a regular at this place . So first, the atmosphere was good. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich garbage , the pork was tough and really seemed like yesterday's left overs after it sat out and got dry , overloaded with a overwhelming bbq sauce that still couldn't mask the flavor of the nasty pork! The fries were good, and me trying to be positive, just figured some cooks have different standards I wouldn't dare say Chef! . So that said, I hadn't seen my mother in a long time, and she seemed to be enjoying her food, so I didn't mention how much I disliked my food although it was evident after I didn't take more than a couple bites after I had just talked up how much I would like a pulled pork sandwich . The last straw for me was when as we were walking out, our waitress mentions, loudly, to the hostess ""wow they took forever "". I figure she hadn't seen her tip yet, and I probably should have went back and taken it back! but I did nothing as she gave us another sarcastic comment before we left. I will say again, my mother is a regular here so I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable. I kept my mouth closed, even though I feel we did nothing wrong for sitting there for a couple hours catching up on missed moments. we bought food, drinks, and tip well. I thought that's what restaurants were for? Please correct me if I'm wrong!",1
"Paper Skyscraper offers a great range of products. They have everything from a small book section to stationery. I bought some nice personal letter cards with an embossed letter and there were many other options as well. n nI found the selection to be eclectic and interesting from almost any way to imagine the terms. I don't mean to oversimplify, but if you can imagine the front area of a Barnes Noble with the items that you would not necesarily think to look for but make great gifts then you have some idea of a good sized portion of the store. I said oversimplify because the items at Paper Skyscraper are both more interesting and original than what you will find at your typical store and overall the store is a great place to go and pick up cool items that you would be hard pressed to find at other retail stores.",2
"The fish was fresh, however wait staff were the worst . I had to ask for water to three different people and two of then twice. I had all you can eat, I ordered the Tempura Shrimp and waited for twenty minutes I asked the wait staff four times, they said they would check they were not slammed with business. After 27 minutes I never got the shrimp I paid my bill and left. Owen boss didn't seemed to care! I will not go back. To many other sushi places to try. They failed me!",1
You really do not have to be vegan to enjoy this restaurant. They serve a delicious healthy brunch!,2
"Food was pretty good. As we were leaving, we handed the guy 60 cash, our meal was around 45, and he came back and said that we only gave him 40. He then left and came back with the 15. It was pretty clear that he was trying to rip us off. The music is a little loud but the service was quick. All in all, I have had better Mexican before.",1
"When I'm hankering for luscious meat, buttery sauces, or delectable fries, Christopher's always comes through. In countless visits, I've seldom been disappointed with the food. The hubby and I shared the lamb shank available Fridays only and it is melt in your mouth, don't need a knife delicious. All the fries selections truffled, curried with duck confit, yam are excellent although way too large for a sane person to finish plan to share. The truffle infused fillet is nice though it cannot touch the lamb and the hanger steak excellent. I've enjoyed the scallops and several fishes of the day, but the meats are the highlight. Crusty French style bread and unsalted butter accompany the meals. Vegetables are available ala carte and those I've tried have been good but generally pale compared to the meats n nLight food is not the focus here the salads are generally good I particularly like the smoked salmon but not enough for a real meal if you are hungry, and I consider them bordering on the expensive side but not too much so. Most other selections are rich with butter, cream, and or animal fats. Yum. n nThe wine by the glass selection is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, with a nice variety of domestic, French, Italian and a few others but who cares about those anyway . Best is during the 4 6 weekdays happy hour, wines by the glass are 1 2 off, making many of them a smoking deal. Happy hour is available only in the Crush lounge and at the kitchen Bar. n nAtmosphere. I really like the open, cool colored decor and the hip but not stuffy vibe. I've gone there in dress and heels, and in jeans in Birkenstocks. OK, at least I had a cute little jacket to spruce up the Birke outfit. My favorite spot is at the kitchen bar, watching the heart of the kitchen activity. During slow times the staff has given us little tidbits of ""test "" items to taste, and Chef Christopher always says hello. The one down side of the furnishings is the ergonomics or lack thereof of the kitchen bar chairs. Did the manufacturer ever test them with real people? The seats are too deep to lean comfortably against the back of the chair. Those with perfect posture may be fine perched on the edge of the chair all night, but we like to linger over dinner and must either sit up without leaning on the chair back all night or slouch back and feel frumpy while gaining only a modicum of comfort. n nService isn't nearly as consistent as the food. Most of the time we've not been offered a taste of the wine before a full glass was plopped in front of us, sometimes service is so slow that we've trouble getting our orders in before happy hour expired despite arriving 30 minutes before it was over , the red wine has several times come quite chilled, and the checks have come without the happy hour discount. On any given day the service is about 90 pretty darn good but with something missing. The disappointing thing is that it's seldom 100 . n nChristopher's periodically holds wine dinners and we attended one last September. Now that was a 5 star feast. I think we had 5 wines, but I can only describe it as endless refills. The food was excellent though maybe a little too French for many there were some super fatty pork bits and some sort of organ meat I think. I loved every bit . Whoa, what a food and wine orgy. And fun, interesting people at the community table.",2

"Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin' . Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. Sorry, for the tirade that's a pet peeve of mine . n nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is. n nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. n nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's ""chicken "" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar same stuff but pre packaged. n nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good",2
"This is the worst of the Las Vegas hotels at which I've stayed. The rooms are tiny, it feels relatively old, and it's dirty. n nThe layout is terrible. We spent half our trip walking from place to place within the hotel. Our shower leaked. Someone was sleeping in the hallway outside our room for an entire night. The furniture in our room fell apart. And these are the best things about the hotel. n nThey must draw people in because it's a bit cheaper than the nearby hotels, but it's not at all worth it. Definitely will not return.",1
"The office acts a fool if you are even a few minutes late or cancel. They Even have the audacity to have a sign stating that they will charge you 50.00 if you fail through with your appointment time. Today, I brought my child 15 minutes late knowing fully well that was time she was going to be in the waiting room anyway! The dentist says to tell me if I'm late or cancel again I can't reschedule ?! Obviously they think its okay to treat paying patients that way!",1
"I heard great things about this place, but I don't understand what all the hype was about. Albertsons has better sushi, everything taste like imitation. At other sushi restaurants if you say you're going to do all you can eat then realize it is cheaper to just pay all a carte they don't make a huge deal about it. The waiter acted like we signed a contract to do all you can eat. I guess the bug crawling on the wall made me lose my appetite. Disgusting!",1
"Vegan, gf raw! So excited! nTHOSE WITH CELIAC'S GLUTEN INTOLERANCE BE CAREFUL see below n nI was very excited to discover this chain had opened up on the southwest part of town. They are ingeniously located near LVAC, making it easy to get a healthy recovery meal after your workout. We ordered Pumpkin spice chai latte, veggie garden burger, and bison burger. Total after tip 38.10 we took our food to go . A little on the high end . Our food came out pretty quickly, but our smoothie took longer than expected. I was hoping to get that first and sip on that as an appetizer while we waited for our food. I don't know if they forgot about our smoothie or was just slow on making it. I did notice however, people after me get their drink before me, they also knew him on a first name basis and gave him the extra out of the blender in a separate cup. They should treat everyone as if they are a regular. Talk about not making me feel special. n n Pumpkin Chai Tea Latte Chai Tea, Pumpkin, Green Cabbage, Carrots, Butternut Squash, Flax Seeds, Ginger, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Walnuts, Agave Nectar. This was really good and very filling. Although the cabbage was pronounced, the smoothie was well balanced and tasted raw the way I like it . n n Bison burger w jicama fries choice of swiss or cheddar cheese, lettuce tomato and onion on a whole grain bun. He wished he got it with cheddar rather than swiss. ""Jicama fries "" are just sliced jicama lightly seasoned with what looks tastes paprika. n n Veggie garden burger I was extremely excited because I'm a sucker for alfalfa sprouts. I asked the cashier if the veggie patty was gluten free, as I have had a difficult time finding a veggie patty that does not use ""wheat gluten "" as a binder. He asked someone on the cooking line, who I assume was a manager, and he said ""yes, it's gf, the patty is soy based protein "" I took their word for it and gambled the risk. Sure enough I think the veggie patty is glutenous so BEWARE to those with celiac's gluten intolerance. I got sick, as I do from eating or cross contaminating with gluten wheat. I have yet to bring my concern to the attention of the staff. Moving forward, the burger was eh okay. My gluten free bun was hard it's difficult to get a soft, buoyant bun using gluten free flour, especially if you're taking your item to go. In the future I will dine in. I ordered my burger with tofu fries. I was told that they dust the tofu blocks with rice flour and fry it in corn oil, so the oil should not be a point of cross contamination, as there isn't anything else with regular flour going into the oil. My burger came with the sprouts, bibb lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I also added vegan cheese, it's shredded. n nWe also added avocado to our sandwiches 0.75 burger for a quarter of an avocado rip off . I don't mind paying extra for modifications, but make it worth my while and not be so skimpy! At least give me a half an avocado for that price, so that I can have it in every bite as opposed to just half my burger. I was charged extra for vegan cheese, again this would be fine, but there was less than a teaspoon sprinkled on my burger, with a 1.00 up charge. n nAlthough the food is pricey, it's raw, healthy, and typically quick, right up my alley. I will be back because there is not many others around like this and to inform them of my gf veggie patty concerns. There are just a few ""tweeks "" they need to adjust before they get the 5th star from me.I hope they properly label their menu on their website and physical menu so gluten free vegan items are clearly marked. Just remember they do not operate out of a certified gluten free kitchen, but it seems that for the most part they handle issues like cross contamination okay. n nService was exceptional. There was a constant line with one cashier at 3 00pm. He was very nice and patient with me since I had a lot of questions.",2

"When we went to check in, it turned out I had made a mistake with the reservation I had put my boyfriend's first name, but my last name. Seems like a minor mistake, but the guy checking us in flipped out and even CUSSED AT US. Wow. Nice hospitality. the F word really makes checking in so much easier. The manager ended up coming over and fixing the situation, but check in took forever. Anyways, we stayed in one of the basic rooms. It was tiny but cute looking on first glance. The carpet had a few minor stains that I didn't notice until later. I was grossed out by a brown stain on one of the ""under blankets "" not the bedspread, but the blanket under it . Flatscreen TV was crooked. Bathroom was good size and clean, but there was no fan, so if you like taking long steamy showers, you might have a problem. Housekeeping was constantly on us about cleaning our room. They kept calling our room or knocking on our door, even when we had the privacy sign up. Every morning, the maids would try speaking to my boyfriend in Spanish. Good things about the room included the safe, the full size hair dryer, the iron ironing board, and the lit magnification mirror in the bathroom good for applying your show girl makeup before hitting the nightlife . The casino is attractive, happening, and the dealers are friendly. I won some good money at the black jack tables roulette was pretty cool too. However, all together, I would not return to this hotel. it just isn't worth the price.",1

"I've heard great things about Mia Za's, and I know many friends who enjoy their menu, but I haven't had anything that was worth the price as of yet. The menu allows for customizing your pasta, sauce, and ingredients, but as someone with little cooking experience I've ordered too many meals with disastrous combinations. This problem can mostly be attributed to myself, but I've also had many dishes from the main menu and found all of them to be bland and unappetizing. One would think that with the amount of times I've eaten here I would have found one dish I liked, but it hasn't happened. Therefore I wouldn't recommend this joint to anyone passing through State Street skip it for something better!",1
"My friends and I went to the Wrigley Mansion for a luch and tour special yesterday. We ordered our food and the first course was really good. It was a spinach bleu cheese salad. The second course was Croque Madame. It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled! I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid. I spit it into my napkin and my 4 friends were shocked because I never send food back and I'm the opposite of a drama queen. That's why they were so shocked. The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined. I'd lost my appetite, of course. My friends fish was almost raw, too. So we decided to take the tour and have coffee dessert afterwards. The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley, was fabulous. I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room. There were no beds or dressers anywhere. But the art, They have a Renoir , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning. We went back to eat our creme brulee's and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there. The waiter didn't freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour. And there were only 2 other tables of 2 there! So we got our desserts and coffee. It was good so far. Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold! I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee' cup. Again, I'm not a drama queen. This was just so bad. We told the waiter the coffee was cold he was so surprised. DUH! He was nice but so inept. We'll never go back, especially to eat! I was the worst dining experience that I've had. They should at least give everybody a pack of Juicy Fruit for the road. Anyway, it was such a disappointment, and I've wanted to go there since high school.",1
"2.5 Stars n nI've stayed in the Mandalay Bay countless times and I've always walked passed Rick Moonen's RM Seafood on the way to the Mandalay Place shops. I had high hopes for RM Seafood after seeing Rick Moonen compete on Top Chef Masters, but my experience was slightly less stellar. n nBe aware there is an upstairs restaurant and an downstairs restaurant. They both have different menus, where the upstairs has the the upscale tasting menu and the downstairs is a more casual dining experience. I still felt the downstairs restaurant had the price tag of pricey restaurant though. n nBefore our meal even started I was slightly turned off when my waiter took my order. I had a good idea that I wanted to try the seafood items since I knew Rick's specialty was in seafood. For some reason our waiter relentlessly tried to upsell me on getting the steak, lobster, or surf and turf, which were of course the more expensive items on the item. It didn't stop there when he proceed to badger me if I wanted any alcohol with my meal. After denying him multiple times I was finally able to get in my order for the Steamed Mussels and the Diver Scallops. n nThe bowl of Steamed Mussels was huge! If only it tasted as good as its portions, I would've enjoyed this appetizer. The mussels were cooked in white wine, garlic, and parsley that created a light broth sitting underneath the mussels. It was accompanied with two garlic bread sticks. The mussels were very fishy and the broth lacked flavor. I was hoping the broth would help cover up the heavy sea tasting mussels, but it didn't help. I was ready to put my fork down by the time I finished half the bowl because of the fishy taste. I've had better tasting mussels in the past. n nNext came the main dish of Diver Scallops. There were 4 huge scallops accompanied with a pull pork, cornbread, and jalapeno chile rellano. The food was topped off with some mole sauce. I will say the best thing on the plate was not the seafood. I actually really enjoyed the chile rellano. It had the perfect amount of heat and the pull pork filling was smooth and delicious. The scallops were a big disappointment. Although they were tender, they were way too salty for my taste buds. n nI think my dining experience couldn't been more pleasant at RM Seafood. Perhaps if I ordered different items on the menu or didn't have such a pushy waiter things would have been better.",1
"I've been going to this place for it's convenience pre movie dinner , but each time the service has gotten worse! There are usually 1 or 2 other people in the restaurant at a time, but last night there were 3 tables and the server was completely in over her head. She snapped at a guy who tried to order a to go order, ""Can you wait?! "" Poor kid. n nThere was a new sushi ""chef "" last night who butchered the nigiri. He was reading the ingredient list for each of the sushi rolls as he was making them and looking blankly at each of the sauce bottles, clearly confused by what each bottle contained. Our rolls came out bland, poorly presented and without any sauce. Overall, it's NOT worth the convenience. We will NOT be back. YUCK. Night Ruin er",1

"My girlfriend and I frequent this bar when visiting Pittsburgh. It's location along the Monongahela River gives it a view of the water and the city. If you're sitting outside the only nuisance you'll experience at times because the tracks also run along the river. n nWe stopped here two times this week and had varying service levels, once attentive and the second we had limited visits from the server and she did not have our drink orders when stopping back after periods away. n nThey claim to have the ""best happy hour "" in Pittsburgh and I'd agree. Happy hour includes half price appetizers, 3 for all draft beers, 4 for all wines, and 5 for all mixers. Also, be careful when ordering your appetizers, they have huge portions. n nWhile here we sampled the meatballs, boneless buffalo chicken, buffalo calamari, sliders, and spinach and artichoke dip. All were good ""bar "" appetizers. I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip the most. n nFor mixers we sampled the ""Effen "" good martini yes it reads this way on the menu . The martini includes Effen cucumber vodka and mint maybe a few other items , but we were huge fans and had this martini each visit. n nIn addition, they have an excellent beer selection both on tap and in bottles. n nThey have many seating options including couches, bar seating, tables, and outdoor.",2
"I have stumbled upon greatness in this boutique that belongs on Melrose or on the Moon instead of Town Square. I am hooked!

"As far as I'm concerned this is the best place to see a comedy show! n nBoyfriend and I have seen John Caparulo and Ralphie May here and had a blast both times. The venue is small, which is ideal for comedy. Even in the cheap seats, you can clearly see the comedian's face, which is usually an important part of their set. There are 3 price points for 3 areas of seating. Long, cafeteria style tables in front, semi circular booths and round tables in the mid and semi circle booths in the back. We haven't sat in front because it seems like such a weird setup. The tables are faced short end to stage, so you have to turn your chair to face front. When half the fun is seeing the people around you laugh, it's weird to have to face away from them. I recommend the booths in the mid or back. They're comfy, intimate and face forward. n nFor the tickets for most things being as cheap as they are, there's just not a good reason to try this place out!",2
"Hula's by far is one of my top 3 restaurants in the valley and when i heard a second location was opening in Scottsdale i was excited!

I ordered the luau pulled pork with sweet potato fries, these portions are pretty generous too, I took 1 2 home. My boyfriend ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken with rice, johnny cakes and plantains. Very generous portions.and very flavorful. I posted pics on here too. n nHighly recommend giving Hulas a try.oh, my favorite drink is called The Painkiller. n nThanks Hulas for another location, great service and delish food ",2
"The food is good, but they're terribly slow. I just went there for a grilled cheese and a cup of tomato soup and I was there for over twenty minutes waiting for my sandwich. I'm pretty confident that I could've made the sandwich myself with a Bic lighter if they'd handed over the ingredients. And I wasn't the only one waiting. There was a woman behind me pushing 15 minutes for a cup of soup, another pushing 20 for a salad. The thing that really blows my mind about the wait times at Barriques is that they don't appear to be understaffed. n nWhat's up, guys? If you want the business that Bluephie's Diner's departure could yield, a grilled cheese is going to require less wait time than half of my lunch break, which is exactly what I wasted there today.",1

The pancakes don't really come with anything.

"Between 2 and 3 stars. A few things were good turkey, beef ribs . Tri tip would've been good but it was very undercooked. Consensus is a step up from Old Country Buffet.",1
"This joint is hoppin' between 6 8pm, even on weeknights, so think about reserving. n nAtmosphere is family friendly saw 2 3 toddlers and busy. n nPIzzas are more traditional style Italian, very thin crust, slightly burnt on the edges this is a good sign coming from a custom built pizza oven doesn't smell wood fired . n nBase ingredients tomato, flour, oliver oil as listed on site apparently all come from Italy. The Antimo Caputo flour is extra fine ground, which perhaps helps the texture of the dough crust n nI ordered the Saucisse au Fenouil, a tasty mix of fennel sausage, onions, bell peppers and the sausage quality was excellent. n nA caramelized onion, black olive, cottage cheese, oregano pizza came with healthy smattering of onion and cottage cheese dollops in four sections. n nThe pizzas are typically quite moist when delivered and there's perhaps of a drizzle of olive oil behind the scenes before delivery. The crust isn't crispy, neither underneath the toppings nor around the outer edge. This is not a downgrade, just a note to give an idea of texture. I prefer a slightly less chewy, lighter, more yeasty flavored dough, but this is just personal preference. n nI'll definitely be back when I'm feeling the need for pizza.",2
"I'm not one to sugar coat it, this is getting two stars instead of zero because they have amazing brewed unsweetened green tea. The burger was just ""meh "" at best as the only way they say that they can cook it is medium well. It was tough dry but covered with everything but the kitchen sink. They also neglected to put in the order for my sweet potato fries, the gal apologized and said she would bring them but never did. Fail. nI wouldn't bother with this place again personally.",1
"If this isn't ""real "" Italian food I don't ever want to try ""real "" Italian. I went twice on this trip to Vegas. Both times we had the Caprese as a starter I've never had such good mozzarella. For entrees, I had the spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parmigiana, both of which were delicious. n nIf you're looking for a quick, delicious bite on the North part of the Strip you have to check this place out!",2
"I enjoy this bar restaurant for taking out of town company to give them a taste of something off strip. Also a great place to watch Packer games. Almost like being home in Wisconsin in terms of the energy and game day atmosphere. It had been a couple months since I'd gone here and I happened upon a slew of negative reviews. I had to check it out to see if one of my favorite places in Las Vegas had really fallen apart. I'm told the other locations had closed and this review does not reflect or comment on that. That's a business matter for the owners to speak on and not the yelping public. n nThe menu is the same menu I remember. I enjoy the cheese curds, Big Dog's salad, and Bratzel quite a bit. The cheese curds are the closet thing to Wisconsin cheese curds I've had here in Las Vegas. The Bratzel is a beautiful creation of cheeseburger, bacon and brat. The big dog's salad is an excellent mexican style salad. On my most recent visit I had the chicken friend steak. The chicken fried steak was one of the better renditions of the dish I've had in town. n nWe dined in the dining room and our server I want to say Lynn? was excellent. Long story short, I'm not quite sure where all the recent hatred for Big Dog's has come from.",2
"My boyfriend and I cam down here last night to try what has been called 'the best' ice cream of Vegas. It is located on the second floor of the California casino across from Plaza which is accessed by the escalator. Since they don't have great signage to tell you this, most people end up wondering around asking about ice cream. n nWe got there half an hour before they close on Sundays 11pm so there were a few flavors out of stock. No matter, they have a bunch but I will admit, though they have like 5 variations of coconut and macadamia nut, the only one I wanted was the one with fudge, and it was gone . So I got my favorite Butter Pecan, and my boyfriend got a cone of the coconut macadamia nut with caramel. n nA single scoop of ice cream is 3.00, while the cone is 3.95 and you get two scoops and it is a lot of ice cream for just once scoop. It is a very thick and creamy ice cream, so it is pretty filling. It's a very buttery texture, but nothing overly buttery though you can feel the cream on your lips . n nI really liked the Butter Pecan, and I did try my boyfriends, but it did not taste very coconutty to me, and the caramel in it was going everywhere, just kinda dripping around and what not. I wasn't very impressed with the caramel either, it really had no flavor for me. n nI'd like to go back and try something else, since it really was a pretty good ice cream.",2
"The service at this location is not what one would expect at an upper end steakhouse or any fine dining establishment. This was my third visit to this location and the service level and attentiveness of the wait staff is not on par with other Fleming's or what it should be for the price point. n nPerhaps as one of the few upper end dining options in the area, they just can't get a decent staff since the area is cluttered with chain casual dining restaurants. n nThis place really needs to try harder and step it up and give people a level of service they expect for what they are paying.",1
"This is our second time coming here. We haven't received our food yet but I can say our first visit was better already. It was busy then and service was a lot better. Just waiting to order today was a wait and it is not busy at all. Food just came in a fair amount of time. n nReceived our meal and our country potatoes were cold on both plates, received one egg instead of two and my pork lion was tough. This experience wasn't great at all but our first time here was outstanding which is why we came back. Not sure what changed.",1
"Wish I could give this place more stars, but I checked out this morning, got to the airport and realized I had left my watch in the room. Called the front desk to have them grab it and they transferred me to. lost and found? Not a good sign. If I were still in the hotel, I would just go up to the room myself and put the watch back on. If it wasn't there, it would be stolen, not lost. In any case, after multiple attempts at getting someone to bother to go up to the room and being told by Jim in security? they were ""really busy "", they finally called me back several HOURS later to inform me that the watch was not in the room. What a surprise. FAIL.",1
"The Bellagio fountains is a must do every time you're in Vegas! n nThe choice in music ranges but for some reason every time I happen to walk by they're playing Celine Dion which I find pretty boring. I love it when they play some older classics like Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole or Dean Martin. I think they should mostly play that kind of music but if they really want to play pop or contemporary stuff then maybe they should think about allowing people to make requests or suggestions. n nMy friend and I were talking about other possible music selections and METALLICA came to mind. I know there are people that don't like that kind of music but just visualize it. It's a perfect fit!",2
"We had a great experience here helpful staff, clean room, comfy bed, free WIFI, and plenty of security. My only complaint was that silly basin sink located at the entrance to the room. n nThis hotel is marvelously situated within walking distance to some of the best entertainment and dining in town.",2
"This is a review for pharmacy service only. I would NOT recommend using this pharmacy unless you have time to sit and wait in the store or have prescriptions you can pick up on a non urgent basis. n nI have tried on multiple occasions 3 to efficiently get a prescription from this pharmacy. I have not succeeded yet, and don't plan to try again. I have called in a script, only to have it not ready 5 6 hours later for antimicrobials, obviously something that someone needs same day , and I have dropped off a paper script and was told to come back in an hour only to return 2 hours later and find it not ready. The only concession is that the staff has actually been nice about stuff, and seem to want to help.I think they are just too busy and cannot keep up. n nI plan to search for a local pharmacy who actually has a pharmacist or staff member who answers the phone to accept call ins on site as I think this may provide better service for myself and my patients in the future.",1
"This is my 3rd time eating here, and first time eating the buffet, needless to say I am not pleased. nThe buffet was about 15.00 and runs from 11 2pm. I came in about 130. I was given water by the owner, and he never asked me if I wanted anything to drink! On the buffet All of the rice dishes were on the verge of dry and crunchy. The eggplant dish was very bitter, the vegtable pakoras we dry and unedible, the ground meat i think beef was just plain ole funky!. The bread that came with it tasted like it was re heated. Overall a horrible buffet. During my lunch, I was never asked how things were or if I needed anything. The cook is the one who rang me out when I was leaving and he asked me how things were, and I told him dry, and not very good. He told me I needed to come in the morning and not so late! So save your money and go somewhere else. I hate to say it, because I was glad to have a indian restaurant in the neighborhood, but this place isnt going to last and is going down fast. nI also noticed in the kitchen that they had ""taste of India "" seasoning pastes. This places says they serve made from scratch dishes.lol.",1
"This is a great little shop. Good selection, nice place to hang, too. nWhen I've asked for the mgr's recommendations, they've been excellent. A great find!",2
"I had not heard of this hotel before finding it amongst the listings in our Southwest Airlines Vacations brochure. Price was great, so did a quick internet search, and discovered this type of boutique hotel was right up my alley. Under 200 rooms, perfect mid strip location, brand new renovation all good things. n nWhen we arrived, I was immediately struck by how dark and inviting the decor was. Our experience checking in was no issue was even offered a welcome Sangria to be sent to our room. However, we didn't hang around long enough to get it. We were in the room maybe 15 20 minutes before we got too excited to start exploring. Not sure how long it was supposed to take to get a couple Sangrias, but we just couldn't wait. n nThe room was beautiful. Deep, rich purple. Super chic. Comfortable bed. Nice mirrored vanity by the window. Large shower. Hardwood floors. A little sitting area with Backgammon table. It was all very nice. If I could complain about anything, it would be the lighting was somewhat too dim and the air conditioning didn't get very cold. Other than that, we were both very happy with our accommodations. n nCasino is small, but it was a refreshing change to some of the larger, maze like casino floors of other hotels. We spent several hours playing in our own casino it kind of felt like our home, I guess. It was still busy, but not too overly crowded. Just a great vibe all around. n nFree breakfast is served daily, which consisted of pastries, cereals, potatoes, sausage and bacon, even an omelet station. We only did this on one of our days, but it definitely satisifed me and I would have had no problem eating their breakfast every day of my trip. n nNever encountered anyone unfriendly. Was greeted kindly at elevators or by housekeeping staff in the hallways. I'm not sure when I'll get to Vegas again, but I would stay at The Cromwell each and every time. It seemed very personable and intimate, and truly gave us a great experience.",2
"Tried to phone order twice was put on hold for over 25 minutes. I called again asked for the restraint manager, got a voice mail.

"Food is ok and boring. It is a part of the Darden chain of restaurants so if you are familiar with Red Lobster, think of a Caribbean inspired version and you have Bahama Breeze. The drinks are delicious and really bad for you, and the food always tastes exactly the same consistency is good. I have actually eaten here a couple times, but my last experience will have me never come back. n nIf you are looking for mediocre food in the array of mediocre food options near corporate Hughes center you could wind up here. Maybe you have coupons and you purposefully drove here? Understood. n nMy final visit to Bahama Breeze began with 2 coworkers and I walking in and standing in front of a host podium without being acknowledged. Three professional ladies, standing in an empty entrance waiting to be seated, until a couple minutes later a host who never lifted her head from staring at the floor, I must have missed the carpet design finally sat us. We were helped by a strangely hostile server who at one point through the meal had his manager come up to us and apologize for the wait for our food. This came as a surprise to us because he never mentioned anything about late food, and we hadn't asked about it. n nWhen our lunches arrived my baja fish tacos with a side salad had turned into baja fish tacos with a side soup. I enjoyed the soup and made no complaints, it was a tasty chowder with fried shrimp. Overall the food was unmemorable but not inedible. The service was terrible. I can't believe that every person I interacted with host, server, and manager were not polite to outright rude. We were told not offered to get free dessert or else our server said he would eat it? wtf? but never received any apologies. Not for the late food, not for our shitty greet at the front door, not for our strangely hostile server, not for our late and incorrect food. Instead we got begged to take a free dessert. Sad. WTF guys, get your shit together.",1
"The only reason I gave it 1 star was because the waitress was excellent and caring. nThis was my first time eating at a Logan's, and it will be my last. nThe rolls were brought to our table and the first bite I took I broke a molar on something hard that was in it. When I spit it out it looked like a large piece of coal or something charred. I had bitten down on it and it cause my molar to actually crack. The pain was horrible, and because of it, I was unable to eat the steak I had ordered. nThe waitress went to the manager, who promptly came out, and without any apology or the remotest sign of concern, requested my name, address, and phone number, to turn over to corporate. No offer of a discount, no further concern for how the pain I was in or the fact that I could not eat the steak I had ordered. I still was not concerned, and was willing to give them a chance. UNTIL, corporate called me. I was unable to take the call when they phoned me the next day, but I did call back to the number that was left in the voice mail, that day and every day since, several times a day. The person who had phoned me was from their loss prevention, Tanya Etheridge, and she has not returned my call since, nor does she answer her phone when I call. nI will have to pay the dental bill for this, and have been in pain since this occurred and I did not even receive the courtesy of concern or a call back. The managers only concern was the possibility that I might be a sue happy person, that was why she wanted to get my information to corporate as soon as possible.",1

The pad thai and curry were really delicious, the meat selection was not that great . It was quite disappointing . The absolutely best thing was the mac cheese ! That was the most delicious thing ! The lobster ravoli is good to. The lobster bisque soup is so salty ,. n nThe desert bar was pretty okay and they have gelato canister which is pretty impressive.

Was very excited to take my lady here been hearing alot about this place. Tvs everywhere is the only nice thing. Got seated and almost took about 60 minutes to get our food was ready to just walk out. Then no kids menu as well when you order the burger we were expecting fries or etc. Nope its only the burger for 12 to 15 dollers.

"I'm not really one to write a review on a dinky little sandwich shop in a strip mall, but I have had so many negative experiences at this place that I felt I needed to share them. The people that work here have been beyond rude every time I have visited this Cousin's Subs. The first time I came in I used a coupon, which seemed to piss the old guy working the counter off. I asked to substitute one ingredient for another and was rudely told ""No Substitutions! "" The workers are always impatient with the customers and always act as if I'm inconveniencing them by being in their store and giving them business. And to top all off, their sandwiches aren't all that good! They skimp on all of the ingredients and try to charge you extra when you ask for more. n nAvoid this place and just go to Subway. You'll get a better sandwich without the attitude.",1

"For real. place was boo boo. My native friend hyped this shit up, and brought me a supreme damn indian taco. That muddafunka was weak sauce. Not much flavor in the red chili. Beans were meh. Cheese.

Fernie was in line right behind me bout ta order when some fine thang who reminded me of a Brown Stallion Horse with skates on came up and told the clerk, ""skuse me.deyyzz supposed ta be sep rit oah duz. "" n nthe clerk looked at her like she was a terrorist, and let out a super long, loud, and frustrated, ""Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk! u00ad "" n nThe shit was disrespectful as hell. n nWhatever. I sat down and waited for my menudo. You figure it should probably take 5 minutes or less to take a laddle. dip the muthafunka in a big ass pot of pre made soup. pour it into a styrofoam container. put a lid on it. put it in a brown bag. toss a pre made baggie of onion and cilantro in. grab a piece of fry bread form the muthafunka crankin out frybread. toss that shit in the bag. and shout out a nigga name. n nNah man. Their shitty ass process took 30 fuckin minutes! Then I took that shit out of the bag! ""WTF is this? "" I said. FBH hooked up a midget ass little cup of menudo, and some fried dough for 7 bucks. My other spot does like 3 times that for less money! Stingy ass FBH. You guys can suck one. That ish didn't even taste good. Work on your broth mane, and throw some damn limes in the bag. Eff this place man. Don't go here ",1
Always the same great food and drinks. Been going to Barros pizza since the late 80's. still the best pizza and wings available,2
"Eh. When it was Cocina Real just a few months ago ti was one of my favorite places. But now, even though the menu is almost exactly the same and the people working there are the same, it seems like the food has gone down in quality and quantity. Nothing comes with your order! My order of quesadillas no rice or beans on the side, no salsa or guac. My friend ordered a burrito also nothing on the plate but a burrito. Pretty lame.",1
"Driving home last week, one of my tires decided that it wasn't happy with being round anymore and it wanted to spend more time playing golf. A flat. I managed to get the donut on and got to Discount Tire the next morning. n nThe staff were quite friendly and very knowledgeable. No problems at all with the explanation of how much it would cost and how long it would take. I walked down to the nearby shopping plaza for lunch and when I returned, they were just pulling my car out of the garage. n nThe only reason I couldn't give it that magic fifth star was that I realized later that they never offered me any choice in the replacement tire. I might have wanted something just a little less expensive. On the plus side, he did offer me their road hazard coverage not just on the tire I purchased, but also on the other three that were still okay on the car. And he gave me a slight discount when I twitched at the 162 bill.",2
Unprofessional owner who discriminates against customers with alternate lifestyles.,1
"This is an over the top unique restaurant.that ""nails "" it on almost everything.and I'm giving it yelps highest grade.but I'm not certain I'd ever return. Its almost an exhausting gastronomic experience.I walked away from here completely satisfied.very very full.yet almost mentally drained. Its a really happening place. Its noisy.dark.hustle bustle. we didn't really care for the atmosphere.not relaxing at all.our table was very close to the waiters pick up station.constant commotion going on. the food is off the charts terrific. .Christopher,our waiter, was very very good. Knew the ins and outs of the menu. Even in the frenzied atmosphere he took the time to walk us through everything we needed to know. Drinks are robust and made perfectly. the bread is almost a meal onto itself.he explained what we were getting.soooo good! as apps.the british ale onion soup,the blue crab soup and the Caesar salad got high grades. My wife had the fishermans grill lobster,mussels and scallop mix and loved it. my son,daughter and I each had the roasted beef wellington.fantastic! Christopher explained twice why we didn't want beef wellington for 2.so we each had our single portion. you can't make this at home! mac and cheese side dish was fabulous. you must save room for the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.we shared.almost puts you in a sugar induced coma. All this comes at a high price but we all left here happy. this is definitely NOT your fathers old stodgy steakhouse.",2
Overrated! I have eaten better crab legs in a lot of places for cheaper and much more flavor! The only thing I liked was the sweet potato tots. Otherwise save your money or lower your expectations,1
"While the hotel is a lot bigger than it seems, you'd never guess it from the personal boutique atmosphere and design. Every space has been given detail and elegance of old Montreal while making it modern and chic in a great location. n nI'd like to stay here again.",2
"This is a great option if you are wanting a nice dinner without completely breaking the bank. It can still get pretty pricey, but the entrees are in the 25 35 range making it possible to keep your check down if you don't add a bunch of extras. n nOur service was pretty good, I never had to wait very long for anything. I sort of made my own entree. I wasn't looking for anything very heavy. I was eying the ""Spaghetti Chitarra "" but thought the prawns sounded good on the Fettuccine with pesto sauce. I ended up with the Chitarra with prawns instead of meatballs. The pasta was delicious. It definitely tasted homemade. The prawns were some of the best I've had super fresh and perfectly cooked. n nFor dessert I really wanted the Crochette, but unfortunately they were out. We ended up going with the semifreddo al terrone, which was like a frozen meringue. Great flavor and not at all heavy. n nI definitely thought this place was way better than Shibuya across the hall. We didn't have reservations when we showed up at 6pm on a Sunday night before a concert, but they had a long wait when we tried to come on Saturday so I recommend reservations if possible!",2
"We were seated promptly, but the table was dirty and the service was extremely slow. There were crumbs on the table and window ledge and the small container holding the sugar packets was sitting in liquid. It truly must have been 10 minutes before a server stopped by our table.to let us know she'd be with us shortly. A few minutes later, a different server stopped by to take our drink orders. Water was delivered promptly, but it was another 5 minutes before we received our cocktails. n nDinner was fine, but underwhelming. My plate had smudges of food some of them obviously not from the dish I'd ordered around the rim very unappetizing, in my opinion. I had to ask for a spoon and was offered an ice cream sundae spoon which is fine, though odd, especially as our server said they have a problem with people stealing their spoons. We waited a long time for dessert also underwhelming and then our bill. n nToo many sub par factors decided I will not go back.",1
"I've always wanted to stop in here but never got the chance. I finally checked it out last night after work. They always have something going on here. Wednesday they have karaoke and Sunday they have trivia. Thursdays are two for one drinks and its packed. They also have drink specials every day. We were starving so we ordered a pizza, burger, and wings the wings were 5 on Sunday . It was all delicious but way too much food. We ended up taking at least half of it home. The service was great. The bartender had great suggestions and was on top of things without being annoying. We are looking forward to going here again for karaoke or trivia!",2
"Honestly this place was not that good. They had lots of flavors but many tasted way fake. The pistachio was just awful! Like a box of Jello pudding! The texture of the gelato was off for me, it was almost too creamy, like eating marshmallow fluff or something. Reminded me of Cold Stone's crappy powdered mix. n nGo elsewhere ",1
"Probably one of the best looking poker rooms I've been to so far. Nice and classy with a slightly softer table so you can pick up the cards easier. The chairs are also nice since they're adjustable in height. The added bonus was all the ridiculously attractive women that were passing by through the casino in their Halloween costumes which frequently distracted my game play.so if you're a guy facing the casino during Halloween, I'd recommend you to request to face the wall or something. n nOne other thing, don't get too drunk while playing poker this is probably a given already but the servers there are amazingly gorgeous and I must have tipped more than I should have.numerous times.",2
"Le Thai, more like Le awesome. n nGreat location, great food, and an awesome staff. The portions here are perfect and the flavor will explode your thai tasting brain. n nAfter a brief moment of waiting outside my friend and I were brought in and sat at the bar. First thing I noticed, you can see right into the kitchen the smells coming from it were intoxicating, which turned up my hunger level to eleven. The decor of the restaurant is a mix of back alley dining with a few standard Thai musings on the wall. I love the vibe of this place. busting, loud and very unassuming. n nThe food here is filling and great to have with a group of friends while sipping drinks and telling drunken stories. If you're feeling super chatty and a bit buzzed, might I recommend what I ate, the Ga Pow! n nGa Pow is a heavy plate of ground pork or chicken with a spicy sauce, chopped veggies, and a big fat fried egg on top. This also comes with a side of white rice, but I opted for brown. This plate of food is more than enough for one eater and could definitely be shared if needed. The meat and veggies were cooked perfect, the pork was still firm and the veggies stayed crisp even though they were swimming in this delightful spicy sauce that I could not get enough of. I mean, hand me straw so I can finish slurping up this savory sensation! The bartender gave me an awesome tip which was to add lemon juice and the dry seasoning at the bar to my meal. I had to fight back the urge to bury my face this bowl. n nMy friend and I started with a soup before our main courses showed up, but sadly I can't remember the name! I know it was first on the soup list and we had fried tofu added to it. This was delicious, an amazing flavorful broth with a few hard boiled eggs in it and multiple levels of zesty flavor. this mystery will kill me! n nA few notes. n When the weather is cooperating, I recommend sitting outside in their back patio area. Clean, spacious, and you really can't beat Vegas weather when it's in the low 80's. n If you find yourself waiting outside for a while, just belly up to the window. Yup, there's a little drive thru window you can walk right up to and order a beer or cocktail and sip with your friends while you wait. Great f king idea! n nPRO TIP Check in and get a squeezable surprise.",2
Had some cocktails here during the winter festival. The atmosphere was great. We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food but the service was very good and we will be back. I'd recommend as a nice bar to gather at and I know they have live music as well.,2
"Pros nrelatively clean in the gym area on weekdays kudos to the cleaning staff , the early morning hours are not crowded at all, and there are some very good spin instructors. n nCons nEverything else. n nFor example. n two of the four Stairmasters have been broken for more than 6 weeks, another has been down for two weeks many members, including me, have reported this weekly . Last Friday I asked the front desk folks if they'd been fixed yet and was told that the repairman was there yesterday and they should be fine. Nope. Still broken. nA week later today , still broken. n n members commonly fail to re rack their weights and equipment, even in the early hours, and the staff does NOTHING about it it should be noted that the personal trainers seem very conscientious about putting things back when they and their clients have finished . n n the sales staff, or rather, the over abundantly sale oriented culture of the facility. nOne year ago, my friend moved to town and was looking for a gym to join I spoke with M e sales and asked if there were any membership promotions going on, coming up, or if there was any benefit in making a referral for a new member. nIn short, I was told no, no, and no. nMy friend came in the next day, asked if she could try out the gym for a day, but was told it would cost 15 for a one day pass I'm not exaggerating. members already know that the club hands out guest passes like candy and there are little yellow guest passes stacked all over the front desk every day . nMy friend got a standard membership nonetheless and had to pay an initiation fee. The very next day, posters were up all over the club about the Thanksgiving membership event NO INITIATION FEE! n Message to my friend and new member Welcome to LA Fitness, now F off . n n bathrooms. It seems to be quite difficult to keep the soap dispensers filled with soap at LA F. Worse, they're not cleaned before opening on weekend mornings. they're in the same shape they were in when closing the night before. n nIt seems that the problem isn't simply this club others speak of the same issues at other LA F locations , it's the corporate culture of the company itself. n nAnd so, despite having to drive a little further to get to a locally owned gym, I'll allow my membership to LA F end this month.",1
Love this restaurant! Very old school Vegas. The way restaurants should be! I usually get the Filet Mignon when I eat here and it's amazing! The staff and service are beyond amazing! The Banana Fosters is a must have for dessert even though everything on the dessert cart looks amazing!,2
"I really wanted to like this place. We have been looking for reasonable Italian food not too far from our house. Unfortunately, in the end we decided we did not like it enough to go back. We had the take out chicken picata special. The bread was strange, not bad but not italian and certainly not ciabatta. I liked the salad alot. It it an antipasto salad so it has lots of things in it like pepperoncini. You have to like that type of salad to enjoy this. Canned black olives did not help it. The fetuccini alfredo was terrible. It tasted strongly like nutmeg. When I taste something like that it tells me they did not use good enough ingredients to let it stand on its own. I have had real Alfredo at Alfredos of Rome in Miami Beach. Whicle I don't expect that quality of food here, the real stuff it very delicate and rich butter cream and real parmagian cheese, nothing else. The chicken picata was good as long as you did not expect chicken picata. It had no lemon in it. It was a nice dish, breaded chicken with mushrooms, capers, tomatoes etc, but it definely was not chicken picata. Desert was chocolate haselnut cake. It probably is very good if you like chocolate and coffee together. neither of us like this. So out of every thing we got, the chicken was OK, but not what it was supposed to be and the salad was good for that type of salad.",1
"I saw VWFW at the Val Vista location throughout my pregnancy with my daughter in 08 09. At first I LOVED them. They did tons of ultrasounds one at my 6 week appointment, one at my 12 week appointment, one at 18 weeks and they also did one at 28 weeks compared to what some of my other pregnant friends got. The office staff was usually very nice and one of the women ALWAYS remembered me and remembered me well after I had delivered my baby which was awesome. They never hounded me about billing which was nice. But. things changed as my pregnancy progressed. I started feeling like each appointment was more rushed. Dr Van Eken who I saw primarily started off super nice but as the months went on I felt her attitude with me started changing. I was having issues with preterm labor and struggling with depression and I felt like I was a bother to her. I got so mad about something one time I don't even remember what that I had to talk to the Office Manager and she basically acted like I was overreacting to the situation. n nMy delivery was fine, mostly because the doctor was only there to catch the baby. Dr Belise ended up delivering my daughter and I don't remember much about her being there, except that she was pregnant herself and that she stitched up my tears even though I had written in my birth plan that I preferred to heal naturally. n nOverall, I wouldn't say that they were awful. just that the doctor I go to now is better and as such I would not go back to VWFW.",1
"One of my absolute favorite places to go. My friends and I meet up there almost weekly for trivia on Wednesday nights. The staff is great and makes sure that you are taken care of.

"South Point has a pretty large casino, but definitely draws a much older crowd. It is off the strip, but there is a shuttle that can take you if you decide to go for just a small fee . My two star review is due to the bartending service or lack there of that I received. Not only did it take them forever to make my drinks, but each bartender i had was really rude. They didn't try to start conversation, didn't smile, and all seemed like they hated their lives.",1

"As an Indian, I would be lying to you if I said that Copper exemplifies traditional Indian cuisine. If I may be so bold, I would conclude that Copper's unique and cultural references make it a hot spot for the best fusion style Indian cooking that I've been to in awhile. n nTo give you some context, the way we eat Indian food back home is with our HANDS, fingers covered in butter chicken gravy, and pieces of chana masala stuck in between our teeth all washed down by homemade raita and mango lassi. Never will you see Murgh Tikka or Sheekh Kebab presented to you on contemporary bowls and platters the way it's done here. At these prices, I could probably buy a goat or three in India given current market conditions. n nFrom a taste standpoint, the flavors are certainly all there. They MUST have an Indian in the kitchen. right next to a mixologist throwing masalas everywhere. ""I know! How about Tandoori spiced cherry glazed duck confit in a soy mushroom black cumin broth with a parsnip kale fricasse?! "" actual menu item Dude, you just mixed 10 different nationalities together! Stick to your day job! n nEven so, from what I tasted, everything was surprisingly delicious and the complexities of each dish were visible and apparent from the outset all the way to the last bite. I also enjoyed the fact that there was portion control in a country with a struggling waist line, which allowed us to try numerous dishes and not feel overwhelmed. n nAll in all, good food, good atmosphere, but don't expect your ""curry "" to be the kind you get in Mumbai or Delhi P n n4 5",2
"Stopped at Irish Republic for a quick dinner with my wife and a friend on Saturday night. Food was good, beer was cold, service was as good as it could be for a bar with that many people in it. n nHere's where the problem comes in 3 Entrees for the table and a beer for me came to around 40 pretax pretip . Left my debit card for the balance and left cash as a tip. I check my bank statement today, and my debit card had been charged for 50.00 flat. I know for a fact that the bill wasn't exactly 50, so it was either changed after the fact or the waitress wrote her own tip on the tip line. Either way, that's shady and not acceptable in my book. Sent an e mail to the manager, will update if i recieve a response, but I will not be dining here again.",1

"I have been going to this location for the last 5 months. I repeatedly overlooked rude comments made by the nail technicians. I figured it was a language barrier so I tried not to get too frustrated or take it personally. The main reason I kept coming back was because I also got my eyelashes done here. I had an eyelash tech named Jenny. She was always very sweet and did a great job. I guess she moved back to Vietnam so I had to start seeing the other eyelash techs. Tonight, I ended up being ""helped "" by a new employee. She ended up taking around 4 hours to complete my eyelash fill. A typical eyelash fill takes about 1 and a half hours, max About 2 hours into process, she told me she could barely see and needs glasses. Long and painful process.I was laying on the table with my eyes tapped shut while she was doing the fill. She kept tugging and poking my eyelid lashes. When she was finally done, I looked in the mirror. My lashes are uneven and one side looks fuller than the other. It literally looks ridiculous! nBetween my negative experiences with the nail techs and now the eyelash tech, I can, without a doubt, say I will NEVER go back to this location.",1
"You still get one star, you douche bags. n nCalled and left a message with their fraud department which was amazingly returned within two days, and they told me that they sent me a letter closing my identity theft claim. click And they sent it to my old address so I had to run down there to get the letter. I am going to write out this entire letter for you so you can see how they deal with issues like this, with some commentary in parentheses n nAdina M., nWe are in receipt of the identity theft claim documentation and very much appreciate your time and effort in providing it to our office. After conducting a thorough investigation LOL one week is THOROUGH?! we have approved your identity theft claim. n nTherefore, we have contacted our collection agency and provided them determination.

All credit checks inquiries through Equifax requested by COX Las Vegas will be removed within the same time frame. n nWe apologize for the inconvenience understatement of the century! and appreciate your help in identifying and removing this fraudulent account. REALLY?! It isn't like YOU were any freakin' help OPENING the account in the first place under the wrong name and address! And I only identified it because I NEEDED SERVICE! If I never called your damn company I would have never known since it did not actually show up on my credit report! n nSincerely, nFraud Department at a different address than what they put on the credit packet. Nice. n n nSo yeah, that's the letter. Did they offer me service? No. At the very least I should have been reimbursed for my time, gas money, faxes, and certified letters. This whole debacle cost me over 50 to fix, and they offer me nothing, just thank me in a ""we fucked up, whoops "" letter. Even if they did offer me service, I wouldn't take it even if they were the only providers in Vegas. I seriously hope this monopoly they are running falls to the ground and I hope that maybe this review will pressure others to call Cox even if they have service with another company just to check if they may have been victims of identity theft. And MAYBE this will spark them to actually hire more people for the fraud department or have more information online since this incident had me running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to fix it, but I seriously doubt it will since they only care about getting money no matter if it is in bad conscience or not. Fuck you very, very much for putting me and possibly hundreds of other Las Vegans in this shitty mess that should not have happened to begin with. n nOh P.S. Thank you for giving me the address used for this account.

"" How rude! I have spent a lot of money at this store, but it is obvious they are willing to lose a good customer over a misunderstanding. Never in my life have I worked with a company who was unwilling to assist a customer to make sure everyone walks away satisfied. Mr. Jim's need to retrain their employees immediately on how to treat customers!",1
" ""pet friendly "" hotel locked us out of room in the middle of the night because we had our two dogs. Apparently, the site through which we booked did not send the information that we were traveling with our two small dogs to the Trump hotel. Their solution, instead of calling my cell phone or just charging the pet fee to my card on file, they lock the doors in the middle of the night. Then the manager lectures argues with you for 45 minutes when you ask to get into your room. What a waste of time!",1
"Although I haven't been in the store itself, I can say with certainty I will be back! My dad brought home a couple for the family. I had the classic! BEST. CUPCAKE. EVER. The frosting was perfect! Not too sweet. The cake was moist but had a crust on top, underneath the frosting. I can't wait to try more. I'm already thinking of an excuse to drive the 45 minutes to go there and try the rest of the flavors.",2
"We were excited to try a new sushi place. However, we encountered a few problems when we arrived that caused us to leave without ordering. n nAfter seating us, the staff ignored us for several minutes, despite the fact that there were only a few guests in the restaurant. We had to flag down a server to take our drink order. She refused to give us tap water, stating that she could only serve us bottled water, which she had to charge for. When it came to ordering food, she refused to honor a coupon we had, claiming that ownership had changed. Why not do the right thing and honor the coupon anyway to try to make sure guests have a good experience at your new restaurant? n nSince we received poor service and were nickel and dimed twice right off the bat, we decided to leave rather than order, and went to another sushi place down the block, where we had a much better experience.",1
"Faster than getting a burger at In N Out! They got me an after hours appointment too, so I didn't have to miss work. Quick and seamless . my doctor was extremely accommodating, and the staff was energetic and smiley. This will be my doctor's office as long as I live in Phoenix.",2
"We had an unexpectedly great night, last night. The meal was excellent and our server, Fernando, was by far the best server any of us had ever had anywhere. He made the night exceptional! nThe menu has a huge assortment of dishes and wines and everything we ate and drank was delicious! And we especially loved the mini desserts. So decadent without overindulging, if you can stop after one! nThanks Fernando. you rock!",2
"Despite having ""dumpling "" in their name, they do not have dumplings on their menu and it's really quite confusing for people who have never been there. However, they have a drool worthy menu full of burgers. n nAside from the sign informing patrons that they are discouraged to stay for more than an hour when it's busy, I had a great time at DDD. The service was really on point because I went there with my boyfriend on Badger game day. I had the Runnelstone and he had the Toadstool. We also ordered a basket of fries. I wanted my burger medium rare with raw onions instead of grilled and that is exactly what I got. It was delicious and aside from the bun feeling a little flimsy was exactly everything I look for in a burger. Juicy, flavorful patty with slightly melted cheese and plenty of onion. The fries were also perfect. Slight crisp on the outside with just the right amount of salt. n nI am totally in love with their burgers and might try to eat my way through their menu. Wish me luck.",2
"Visited this restaurant while in Pittsburgh for the day. Aside from the novelty of a brewery being in a church, the experience was not good. The service was incredibly slow and inattentive. I ordered a 20 ""speciality "" pizza chicken sun dried tomatoes and was extremely disappointed. It had no flavor. There was no sauce of any kind, the chicken wasn't seasoned, and the so called sun dried tomatoes were dry and flavorless. After delivering the meals, the server never checked back. Our drinks were refilled as he handed out the checks. The only positive thing I have to say is the bread and garlic herb butter were tasty. Would never go back and quite frankly, wish I hadn't have gone in the first place.",1
Worst. Experience.Ever! Took over an hour once we were picked up at the airport to get to our hotel. Driver drove like a madman and did not obey traffic rules or display good traffic judgement. He also bitched and moaned how he should not have worked today the entire time. Horrible. Don't bother with them. Just pay for a cab!,1

"Good things about this hotel n nComplimentary breakfast's nAir conditioning nMini fridge nFree coffee coffee maker nIroning board iron nGood tv nFriendly staff nNice pool nClose to ASU nThe bed is comfortable enough. nVery cheap price 36 day for a 3 week stay. n nMy room was 112. nWhile I have enjoyed my stay, and there are some good things about this hotel, I really feel like it's the bare minimum and the goods do NOT outweigh the bad. At the most it makes it barely worth the 36 night. The ONLY reason I recommend staying here is if you need somewhere to stay in Tempe for a little while at a very cheap price. n nBad things n nMany broken appliances lights. n nYou need to jiggle the bathroom light a few hundred times just to have it turn on. The microwave doesn't turn and even when I do get it to work for 30 second intervals, it's so broken that the microwave seems to target only one part of it, and burn the crap out of whatever you put in there. n nThe ac outlets are annoying, to say the least. They're all so loose most things don't fit in them, or easily fall get knocked out. Just charging my phone turns into a nightmare. n nDirty to the point of it being disgusting. n nForget having clean bed sheets. The most the maids do is take the old ones and straighten them on the bed the top layer got so disgusting, my girlfriend and I took it off and stuffed it in a corner the first day we stayed here. It has yet to be so much as touched by the maids after 2 weeks of service. Then again, I haven't seen them do more than make the bed and quickly wipe down the counters. n nThere is a MAJOR problem with pests here. I've seen other people commenting on this and you need to know, if you're squeamish about squishing or seeing roaches and crickets DO NOT STAY HERE. We have found a total of 2 crickets and 4 cockroaches crawling around the bathroom, and room constantly. I trapped 4 of them to show the front desk, and they basically said they'd get someone to spray. It was another 24 hours before anyone got here and did anything. n nThe bathrooms look like they haven't have been thoroughly cleaned in years. The air filters have mold and the toilet pipes are rusted and nasty. n nThe walls are very, very thin. n nYou can hear regular conversations like you're in the same room. Thank god the people next door only stayed a couple days. n nThe free Internet. n nIf you don't have a room next to the router you're going to have a BAD time. At best we have two bars on our computers and we're relatively close to the front. They definitely need more routers. n nAll in all it's basically a ""you get what you pay for "" kind of place. Cheap gets cheap. Not highly recommended, by any means but decent. I think it deserves at least two stars though for all the pluses.",1

"Ice cream is one of very few foods I will admit to being a snob about as in, ""I am an ice cream snob "" . Tortillas too, but that's for another review. Anyway, Sweet Republic has the best ice cream, gelato, fro whatever, etc. I've ever had. Hands down. What really makes the place special, though, is their help. Whether it be one of the owners or staff, they're always very knowledgeable about their product, will engage you to talk about their product and help find the best flavor for you, and are fast so the line doesn't get too backed up as we've all seen in many an ice cream parlor. Whoever does the hiring deserves a special award. Sweet Republic's people are the best.",2
The Mac King comedy magic show is excellent. This is just a fantastic way to spend an hour during the afternoon. You will be laughing the whole time and the magic tricks are very impressive. I was fortunate to be selected to go on stage and it was great fun. The show is also inexpensive with lots of opportunities for discounts e.g. 2 for 1 for CA residents . nBeing front and center is really important for this show. My seat improved dramatically when I gave a tip to the usher leading me down. I would highly recommend this.,2
"The Skinny breakfast offerings are pretty to look at but aren't that great 2 , service it's counter service but the best thing is it is close to the beverage fountain 3 , value three pastries was around 9 which is expensive considering the caliber 2 . n nWe were eyeing the pastry case since we walked into M resort for our staycation. Finally on our last morning, we indulged with an italian doughnut, a blueberry scone and an almond croissant. n nThe italian doughnut was okay the custard was a little on the eggier denser texture than say a rich smooth custard and rather ?bland. I wasn't a fan of the filling and it didn't help that there was plenty of filling inside. The doughnut itself was okay but nothing memorable. n nThe almond croissant was flat as a pancake not airy and flaky from the overly moist filling inside. The filling didn't taste like almonds at all. Overall, bleh. n nThe blueberry scone was the best of the baked goods. Albeit a little dry, it had a more crumbly dense texture with some blueberries inside. Flavours were fine though. n nOverall, this bakery really didn't impress especially when there are some great bakeries ie, Payard, Jean Phillipe, Bouchon on the Strip to compare to. In light of the pricetag, it was definitely expensive for what it is. I'm not sure if what I ordered was the exception rather than the rule though in terms of the quality.",1

"While I've only been here for First Fridays, there's something special about Emergency Arts that draws me back time and time again. There's energy and imagination and inspiration in abundance to be absorbed and admired and just taken in and you wind up walking out with all these creative ideas in your head. It's wonderful! n nI've never met an art snob here, but I have met some very talented artists, and a great photographer or two that have been downright inspirational to me. The best thing I can write as far as a Yelp review goes is this is one place that you really just have to step foot inside of it to understand. Once inside go exploring. Look around, see what's down the hallway or up those stairs. And the Zine library is another part of EA that stopped me in my tracks.lots of good info there. n nParking Fremont St. parking is not good. I park at the El Cortez parking garages and just walk over. n nThat being said I give Emergency Arts 5 Stars and a place on my Best of Las Vegas list!

"I sit here having my breakfast of french vanilla yogurt that's topped Bluberry Granola Flaxseed and sipping green tea. It inspired me to write this mini review of the bulk food section for Winco because I got most of the stuff used to make my breakfast here., go figure! n nThis section is cooler than cool! I was so fascinated at all the stuff they had to offer! You control how much bulk item you want, whether it be a 1 2 scoop to filling up a bag. The choice is up to you! The prices set are pretty low as well. I spent as little as 60 cents on a little bag of cookies for myself. n nFrom what I remember there are all kinds organic goods, spices, cereal, granola, flours, cookies Mothers ICED CIRCUS ANIMALS ones! pasta, powdered mixes of gravies, cheese ya you know that mac cheese powder stuff , wrapped candies, chocolate, JELLY BELLY beans, different nuts, beans and rice. Some rice like Pink Madagascar, which I usually got at WF, but they got it here at Winco same quality and taste, but cheaper! Oh and Forbidden Black rice can be found in the bulk food section too. Heck they even have bulk PET FOOD! that section is clearly seperated from people food and bags marked differently just so you know n nAlso did you know you can make your own peanut butter? You can grind the honey roasted peanuts located against the back wall. Everytime I go to grind a batch other shoppers take notice because they dont realize you can grind the peanuts. On my latest visit here I noticed Winco added different varieties of Stash tea bags sold indvidually. Pretty neat that you can just buy a bag of tea for 9 cents. Well that's my mini review for Winco Bulk food section. Take time to check it out. Alrighty back to having breakfast.",2
"This airport is like old Vegas, you know its there, but you just kinda go there to walk through it to get someplace else. n nIt's a very awesome feeling getting off the plane and then immediately be greeted by slot machines. As for everything else at this airport, it's your basic runabout airport with no frills, just a workhorse for the people coming in and out of Vegas for conventions, meetings, 21st bdays, and ""crazy "" bachelor ette parties. n nBe prepared to run into some characters when you roll up in here. Don't be scared, just enjoy it, you see much more when you get into Vegas. I guess this does give this airport some personality and some ""charm "". So just enjoy your stay!",1
"Haddows deli and coffee shop is not to be confused with off licence Haddows which is what I immediately thought of when I popped in here for a tub of Ben 'n' Jerry's the other day. n nI had to wait in a short queue and when I got to the front I was served by a friendly gent who was nice and helpful. I was very tempted by the deli counter which offered a good range of fresh cheeses, meats, salads and sandwich fillings but seeing as I'd just had lunch I decided just to stick with my tub of cookie dough. n nThe whole shop smells amazing and if you're looking for a quick bite, a snack for later or a coffee to go then Haddows is excellent.",2

The food did not wow me. I will not be returning.",1
"This review is a little outdated but I'm playing catch up and wanted to include this. n nWe've passed this place a bunch and decided to go try it out for dinner one night. I ordered a balsamic vinegar salmon and when it was delivered I could smell it was off and the chef didn't? . I tried a small bite to be sure, and yup, it was off. I told the waiter and, get this, he tried to tell me that can happen when you put balsamic vinegar on fish. Seriously? First off, no, it doesn't. Secondly, if it did, why would you offer it? Third, WHO CARES!?!?!? It's bad. Say you're sorry, take it back, offer something up, whatever. Then it took the manager to come over and I had to explain that the fish was bad and they tried to offer me something else. Let's see, I just had a plate of bad fish delivered to me and the smell is still in my nostrils. Yeah, ya know what, can I have some chicken? Rare if you don't mind, so we can keep with the theme. Knotheads. n nI have to assume it was just a bad experience for me, as they are still there, and I see some good reviews, but I won't ever go there again.",1
"Solid choice when you want something specific the have so many choices it's ridiculous , and quick. You can place your order online, and by the time you get there, it's probably going to be ready. Very nice if you have a short window for breaks, or are in a crunch for time. n nI docked a star though, because I feel like the protein portions are usually lacking. Doubling your meat on the sandwich is definitely worth it. n nIf there's one reason I keep coming back though, it's the banana chocolate shakes. Holy crap.",2
"I came here 2 years ago and it was good. I spoke to the owner in Cantonese and she was very delightful. nWe ordered the pork fried rice and the house soup. The soup was a clear chicken broth, included lots of veggies and bbq pork. It reminded me of my mom's soup.",2
"UPDATED 8 2012I went once for brunch and the food was good, I thought the prices were moderate. A dinner experience there was a lot of fun the food was very good octopus with bar b q sauce, strange as it sounds it was real tasty as a starter wine selection was OK and moderate in price. I would not describe this as an upscale place or put it in the same category as Carpe Diem across the street. The service was typical for what can best be described as an ""East Village "" type of restaurant. The only caveat I would pass along is not to sit in the first three booths by the door, it can be annoying with people coming and going. nI would go back especialy those times I want a modern hippie experience and a good time.",2

"This is the closest market to my home and I've always loved the idea of a grocer that is easy in and easy out for those last minute items I need to prepare a meal. Unfortunately this is still just a Walmart. Just getting into a parking place is a struggle as every spot is tight micro cars would do fine and I'm amazed how many spots are occupied by carts patrons lazily leave un corralled. nI'm not a fan of shops that permit various organizations to confront you coming and going to make a donation to their cause by purchasing a no name chocolate bar or box nof cookies. This seems a constant here. nInside the various departments from produce to Beauty and health seem poorly stocked and littered with abandoned carts full of products either going back on the shelves or not quite having made it there. nThe employees seem to be more interested in discussing with each other their plans for their day off, bad mouthing management, other employees and even patrons. On top of this they seem irritated that you interrupt them to actually try to check out or ask for an items location. nThe bottom line is. This is a place I would never do my regular shopping at. It's just too sad and disappointing. However, to use it as a quick alternative in order to pick up 1 or 2 items I will likely grit my teeth and deal with it for the convenience.",1
"The food is great, although the host and reservation staff struggle. I've made several reservations in the last six months, most of which get confused or when I call back to confirm, are somehow missing. Luckily I always say ""I'm calling to confirm a reservation I made last month with , "" and usually they realize that they made a mistake. I recently made a reservation under my client's name and company and when people showed up asking for the reservation for the company name, they were told there was no reservation. I and the potential attendees were not happy, and if this hadn't been confirmed TWICE and we weren't regular customers, it would not bother me as much.",1
"Let me start off by saying that I really, really, really had much higher hopes for this company as I found them here on Yelp and saw nothing but 5 star reviews. n nWe needed a windshield on one of our company vehicles replaced. n nI called on a Thursday and spoke with Joe. He seemed very eager to accommodate our busy schedule and I was grateful for that. Joe stated that he had the windshield we needed and could have a 6 "" tint strip installed before they arrived for an additional 15.00. Sold. He set an appointment for Saturday at 10 00 am. n nSaturday morning, no one showed up. We received a call from Joe later in the afternoon stating that he was having brake issues with his work truck. I completely understood and wouldn't want anyone to be put at risk for the sake of replacing a windshield. We agreed to reschedule for the following week after his truck was safe to drive. n nI believe it was a Tuesday evening that we rescheduled for, and I even gave him a 2 hour window to work with 5 00 7 00 because he was coming from Mesa. I thought, ""Surely he will redeem himself. "" According to the owner of my company, Joe showed up after 7 00 without the tint strip installed on the windshield. He did offer to reduce the price of the windshield for the missing tint, but that only meant that we'd have to find and install the strip ourselves. Joe also stated that we ""never requested a tint strip. "" n nOverall, I was very disappointed with this company. The reason I gave two stars is because he had the best prices of anyone that I had called, but I guess you get what you pay for. I'd much rather pay a little more and have my time treated as though it was valuable and get what I was promised.",1
"I wish I knew about this website a few months ago. n nMy family and I had great experience at other cheesecake factory. This location was a total upset. We made reservation ahead of time for twelve people and the staff rest assured that they can accomodate that much. n nOur reservation was supposed to be at 6 00 pm, but we weren't seated until 7 00 p.m. At this point, the men in the family were all upset, but still had to go in, for the sake of the ladies. So we followed the staff to an area, but only to find out that they didn't have our table ready. We were told that we will be scattered or to be sitted in different tables.even though we had a party of twelve. By this time, I was really angry. I wasn't able to hold myself in, I freaked out. They were supposed to find a way to meet our needs. Like they say, customers are always right. But the unorganized staff didn't deliver at all. Everyone in my family were upset because of what was going on and we were suppose to have a great time since it was my daughter's birthday. Anyway, as mentioned the staff were just horrible. We didn't get our drinks in a five minute time frame, but instead longer. It took us even longer to order and to get our food. The most irritating part, they messed up on some of the orders and didn't even apologize. Since I am very carefree, I asked one of the staff for the manager. I told the manager that we weren't happy and that, he had the worst staff any person can imagine.Out of all the cheesecake factory at the ceasar's forum staff, the manager, I believe was, the only one who was decent to actually care about his job and the reputation of the restaurant. n nSkip this place when you are in Las Vegas. The worst restaurant ever. I would rate this place half a star.",1
"So not impressed with this place on a Friday night. n nWe were able to get on the guest list a little too easily.this should have been our first sign. We got there and had no wait in line.another sign. We get in and there was hardly anyone in there. The decor is just blah. From the lighting, the place appeared black on black on black with a splash of yellow light. Just weird. The music was also strangely un Vegas like. n nThe positives We were able to easily and quickly get to the bar for drinks, the go go dancers were pretty, and we could quickly and easily exit when we finished our 1 and only drink. n nSeriously doubt we will be returning to Chateau anytime in the near future.",1
"Massive typo in the title! n nIt reflects the business I feel very nonchalant. I've been there a couple of times and the employees always seemed to have something better to do than to acknowledge me, whether it be laughing at some inside joke or what have you. At some point I needed advice and the employee hauled herself in my direction, and blurted out a recommendation. nWhen I was leaving she asked if I could let them know how the products worked out but that was too little too late I'm afraid. n nIt's a crying shame because this shop really is the prettiest of the Lushes I know it's airy and comfortable to walk through.",1
I'm conflicted about this review for two reasons n3 of my girlfriends HAD appointments on a busy Sat two of the appointments weren't on their books and the salon was very busy. They were able to get us in but after talking to the stylists we realized that some of them had worked all day open to close without a lunch break or even a 15 min break. The blow outs looked good but as far as being under staffed and under organized I'm giving them a lower rating. The employees looked rushed and stressed. This is an appt based business so you know exactly how many clients are coming in and should be able to better accomodate your staff and guests. It was odd that what I thought was the ower or salon manager had their dog in the salon on her lap which she had time to take for a potty break but no time to staff her salon properly. Clueless.,1

Their service is terrible. If you have the pleasure of having Kelli as your server then good luck. She made us feel like we were a burden to her so we left. There are way too many places to have a beer and watch the game with great service to have to deal with that.,1
"Not sure what all the rave reviews are about. This is nothing special. Of all these reviews, nobody mentions that there are no regular jet tubs for your feet. Makes me wonder if some of these are fabricated. I've never had a pedicure where my feet were placed in a tub like a bucket . A bit odd. They claim it is for sanitary reasons. On the good side, the young lady was very nice and seemed like she wanted to do a good job. I was just a bit disappointed with the ""bucket "", and nothing else about it was special. I've been to better salons, with slightly lower prices. I found their prices high for a very unremarkable experience.",1
"We had the all you can eat BBQ ribs for 15.99. The sides were corn, corn bread and mashed potatoes. The ribs tasted like they were old and just kept warm over the weekend, with a cheap BBQ sauce straight from a jar. No grilled flavor at all. I specically asked if one of the veggies were green and the waiter said yes, veggies are included. I don't think he understood what we asked. n nHubby finally just returned his and got a salad, I wish I would have also. nThe 10 margarita pitcher was nice.",1

"So driving down Guy street I noticed this Szechuan restaurant and had to try it. Ordered the Beef soup, fried beans, noodles and dumplings. nI must warn that I spend 3 months a year in china and that most people rating this place has probably not been to china. nI know Szechuan food and this was far from the real thing. The one which came close was the beef soup. Not spicy and only a small hint of peppercorn, 4 star for this. nFried beens was not even close to the real thing but for montreal a 3 star! nNoodles were like plain noodles. OK if I ordered them but I ordered the Szechuan noodles which should have peppercorns coming threw my nose. None here! 3 star for that and that was high! nFinally the dumplings! GROSS! WTF they serve frozen dumplings which you buy at the grocery stare! Big shit they give you 18 of them. Its 6.99 for a complete bag at the corner store and even fast better at the house. 1 star for this crap! nOver all very disappointing.

"This is some of the Best Vietnamese Food the valley. Nice little Family Owned and Operated hole in the wall restaurant in a tiny strip mall in Tempe. You will always see the same friendly family members there providing great tasty food and service. Inside is clean and cozy but simple. Gets busy really quick at lunch. On many of my visits there for lunch I see our hard working local law enforcement and fire fighters taking a break and enjoying a quick meal before they get back to work. Some of the tables are round and ready for a large group. n nI love the Pho there. It is so much better than some of the others in town and is packed with flavor. It comes with a plate of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and some lime wedges. The table also has all the condiments you may want such as schricha, housin sauce, fish sauce, etc. The Glass and Egg Noodle Soups are fantastic as well. Try the Bun which is very tasty and is an Angle Hair Noodle dish with the meats of you choice topped with scallions, peanuts, fried shallots and served over chopped red lettuce, herbs, cucumbers, sprouts and yummy fish sauce. One of my favorites is a specialty dish call Pho Ap Chao and is a plate of fried Crispy Rice Noodle Cake with Shrimp, Crab, Beef and all sorts of Veggies covered in a delicious light brown garlic sauce. So good. n nEverything is great here and they have too many dishes to explain them all. They also serve a large selection of Chinese food for those who are not in the mood for something different. Simply Outstanding!",2
"Took a cab from Tempe Diablo Stadium to Courtyard Marriott Sky Harbor. Just a few miles but the driver keyed the wrong hotel and was well passed the hotel when I let him know he was going the wrong way. I had to look up the address and give it to him. When he finally got us there he didn't offer to adjust the fare even though it was his fault. First time, last time with these guys.",1
"the only great thing about this place is the french fries, theya rea real fresh cut potatoes, really really good, if not for those this would be a 1 star. the hot dogs were small in the bun, the toppings were ehh ok, but the bun wasnt steamed, more like it was toastes, and thats not how its dnoe in chicago. the staff were super freindly, but it was expensive. ill still make the trek to the planet hollywood for my hot dog fix at pinks",1
"Cool, casual atmosphere set in the heart of downtown Charlotte. The only cornbread I've ever had that's the equal of this is served at Club 83 in Memphis, and I've NEVER had green beans this good!",2
"All I can say is that my hubby a.k.a. the man who eats to live not lives to eat RAVED about how good their enchilada sauce was. I think we have found our new favorite go to mex place. AND, last night was JAZZ NITE.a bit weird ambiance for a Mexican food restaurant but WAY FUN! Can't wait to go back.",2
I expected more for 5. especially with a hot dog place in the D .,1
"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this hotel and casino. If you're walking the strip, Planet Hollywood is centered pretty well in the middle, so you can walk either way, without tiring yourself out too much. While checking in, we tried the 20 room upgrade trick, which didn't work, so we were stuck with our room without a view. Which was really okay because we weren't in Vegas to sit in the room anyway! nI believe we had the least expensive option and our room was a pretty typical hotel room.average sized and clean. The bathroom on the other hand, was quite large and included a separate shower, bathtub, toilet with a door, and a roomy counter with sink and large mirror. When everything is separate, it really makes it nice for getting ready to go out multiple people can get ready at once . nThe casino part of the hotel was also nice and features the Pleasure Pit, which basically consists of sexy, scantily clad dealers and go go dancers, dancing to popular music. nThe attached Miracle Mile Shops have practically everything you could want with many higher end shops, some great restaurants and bars, and tons of entertainment options. We saw several shows while visiting, including Marc Savard, Comedy Hypnosis, located in the V theater in the Miracle Mile Shops and Holly Madison in Peepshow, located in the CHI Showroom in the hotel. If you're interested in seeing Holly, Planet Hollywood is definitely a good place to stay. We were walking through the casino on our way to our room one night, and happened to see Holly and a cameraman. They were apparently filming for the show Extra, so we stood in the background. Didn't get to see the show when it aired, but it was great way to meet Holly! And if you are looking to see her, act fast because I believe her stint at Peepshow will be ending this year. nOverall, I would absolutely stay here again and definitely recommend this hotel to others. It is a nice, mid range hotel in an excellent location and has many things to do and see in a close general proximity.",2
"Totally unacceptable customer service. Not a good way to run a business. I wish I had read some of these reviews ahead of time. n nWe came from N UT and had always found the R C Willeys fine there including customer service. Here in Las Vegas we will be taking our business elsewhere. We bought a TV console in the clearance area for a good price then I waited in line to pay for it including an extra 59 dollars for delivery. The cashier I think her name was Cindy told me how much available credit we had on our R C Willey account so I told her please put this purchase on our account. She said, ""I don't know how to do that "". Huh? You're a cashier and you don't know how to charge something to your own company's account? n nAnyway, she said that she needed to speak to a manager to see how it was done. She leaves for a few minutes, comes back and says it's all taken care of and your delivery will be on the next Friday this was on Sat . My husband and I rearrange our furniture and give away our old TV console and wait on Friday for a delivery. No delivery. So I call. Oops, your sale was never charged to your account so the sale was voided because it shows as never being paid for. And of course the TV console we wanted was then sold on that Monday so too bad, so sad. n nI call the salesman, Dick ""Dixon "", no help, just cops an attitude. I call customer service and am on hold for 20 minutes. I ask to speak with a manager to see if we can get a similar console at a similar price. I'm put on hold again for about 10 minutes. Then they transfer me to Nadia, a sales person in the clearance area who was extremely rude, said she was not a manager and couldn't do anything for me and hung up on me. I tried calling customer service back but of course was on hold again listening to bad Christmas music. At that point, I gave it up as not worth my time and aggravation. n nBottomline, we won't ever be shopping there again. We had way better customer service at Walkers.",1
"Judging from the range of scores from other reviewers I think your liking of Namaste might be based on a particular preference toward Indian food done a specific way. n nI couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but I just didn't enjoy my meal here very much. n nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was filled with HUGE chunks of dark meat chicken. I'm not usually a fan of dark meat but Indian cuisine usually gets it to really blend with the sauces and spices. This wasn't the case here it was like tasteless brown meat dipped on sauce. n nMeat and veg dishes on the lunch buffet were OK, but a little odd Paneer mixed in with a dry sort of Veg offering was a little unusual and out of place. n nOverall OK, but not in my first few choices for Vegas Indian.",1
"Suffering from a mild bout of cabin fever, my daughter and I decided to brave the arctic conditions and grab some spicy food at A La Brasa. I reviewed the menu options online before our visit and had a couple Peruvian influenced items in mind when we walked through the doors. However, the restaurant now describes itself as a ""Mexican Grill "", so it was time for a quick change of plans note to management please update your online menu . n nAfter seating us, our server dropped off a basket of standard grade corn chips and a bowl of pico de gallo. The chips were heavily salted and were nothing to write home about. The pico de gallo was excellent it was loaded with fresh onions, cilantro and tomatoes along with a healthy dose of jalapenos. My only problem with it was the bowl was too small and every time we tried to use a chip to scoop some out, most of the contents ended up on the table. Because of this, we soon ran out of pico de gallo, but our server was too engrossed with a cell phone call to notice that we needed a refill. n nAfter adjusting to the new menu, I decided about the beef version of the Cemita Poblana sandwich 10 . The sesame encrusted bun was a disappointment it had the texture of a hamburger bun from the local Piggly Wiggly. Also disappointing was the beef cutlet too little beef and far too much of the greasy breading. I did enjoy the rest of the sandwich, which included loads of buttery oaxaca cheese, slightly sweet caramelized onions, spicy chipotle peppers and perfectly ripe avocados. n nThe 7 cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter became a comedy of errors. She is a vegetarian and the first version of her cheese quesadilla was peppered with small chunks of chicken. We flagged down another server our initial server was still busy on his cell phone who apologized for the error and promised to make a cheese only version. It came ten minutes later, but this time, the thick corn tortilla was a soggy mess. I wonder if it sat on the counter too long, since the first quesadilla did not have this problem. The replacement quesadilla also lacked a serving of the salsa verde that added some much needed zip to this dish. We again flagged down a server, and after another wait, we received the green salsa. By then the whole thing was getting cold ugh. While my daughter did enjoy the melted oaxaca cheese, she stated she strongly preferred the 3 Los Gemelos version of this dish. With no sides, this dish was a poor value. n nThe interior of the restaurant was extremely clean, flooded with natural light and nicely decorated. n nOverall, the negatives of my visit spotty service, lackluster food outweighed the positive superb pico de gallo . With so many other great, local options for Mexican food, I doubt that I will be paying A La Brasa a return visit.",1
"Great food. Way overpriced. Tableside guacamole. Two people, bill was over 250. I'd say that it was some real expensive Mexican food.",1
"Grass fed beef. Can't go wrong there. No complaints about the burger. The beef was juicy and the jalape u00f1o bacon had exactly enough heat. Just wished the fries had a little more seasoning, though.",2
"I really do not like to write bad reviews, however, If there was a bad review I have been waiting to write it was this one. If anyone has read any of my other reviews it is easy to see I eat at a lot of places all over the country. I have been to some really high end expensive establishments. I have to say that this has to be the most unreasonably over priced steak house I have ever been to. We walked and and were seated at our reservation time. They were probably 75 full when we arrived. We sat at our table 5 10 minutes before the first person came to our table. It was another 5 10 minutes before we received water and bread that we did not even want. As we were waiting for our water, we did open the menu and we were quite entertained with the 3200.00 bottles of wine, 300 appetizers, 100.00 steaks. I get it, It is a high end establishment, but if you are commanding premium prices, then you ought to be providing 100 premium services and food. So on to that part, the food. I ordered chicken which was so OVER salted, I only ate one piece of it. My wife ordered Halibut which was so dry that it was almost like rubber. Our friends ordered steaks Filet , of which I tried and found them to be sour in taste. The only thing this visit had that warrants a star rating, is the crab cake appetizer, 32.00 mind you, and the sweet potato fries, 10.00. So, if you are looking to visit an establishment where you can flaunt your disposable income, or your looking to meet someone who is flaunting, this is your spot. If you are looking for good food, and good service I would strongly recommend you try another spot. n nThe manager did follow up with a call to see how our service was, and upon learning of our opinion on the visit, he offered us a bottle of wine, which we dont really drink. When we told him we were not interested in wine, he said he would take 100.00 off of our next visit. Given that we are out of town, that was of no value, and even if we were gong to be around longer, I would not go spend another 300.00 to get 100.00 off. n n of in Yelp talk 61 per person does not describe what you can expect to pay per person here. That will be just for your main entree item singular , no side, no drink, no appetizer, no sweets. Oh, you will get bread. Expect to pay roughly 100 per person at least if you want 3 courses.",1
"The food is just ok, but definitely not worth the price. If you want an excellent gyro that is worth every penny, I recommend Pita Heaven.",1
How do I delete a review?,1
"I have been to Sushi on Tropicana many times over the years. I live nearby, and it is convenient. n nThe sushi is good, and the price is right. n nHowever, the last few times that I've been there, the service has been so excruciatingly slow, that I am going to start looking for a new favorite sushi place. The other night, it was over an hour between the time we sat down, and the time the first round of sushi arrived. n nAfter we finished that, I actually got up and walked over to the waitress station to grab our server to take our second order. nThat took about 45 minutes to arrive. n nMeanwhile, the table next to us had taken out a portable DVD player to entertain their children, and was blasting some action flick through tinny speakers. I mentioned it to the wait staff, who did nothing. n nThe food is good, but it is not worth the wait or the aggravation.",1
"I came here for the first time earlier this week since I was in the area and read the great reviews on Yelp, and was completely disappointed. I ordered the house chicken and the flavor was too overwhelming and the veggies were soggy. I also ordered their vegetarian roll and thought it was gross instead of putting in a ton of veggies, all it had in it was avocado, cucumber, and cream cheese. And about 90 of the filling was cream cheese. n nCream cheese sushi not cool. n nSeriously, go somewhere else.",1
"Year to year, this is my summer time favorite. Their quality is perfect for a snowball. Just like the ones from New Orleans. nIf you are looking for some great authentic flavors, try the chocolate or the praline topped with condensed milk. My favorite is wedding cake. nAnd the prices are great for a cheap treat when you are leaving Ikea!",2
"I came in for lunch with two girlfriends while staying at the Monte Carlo we were starving and Diablo's looked pretty cool from the outside. n nI ordered a shrimp salad which literally had exactly 3 shrimp sliced in half lengthwise then flipped over cut side facing down to appear to be 6 shrimp. That, however, is the least of my complaints. n nOne of the girls ordered tacos and asked for Tapatio. You know, a bottle of Tapatio. She received a side of 3 salsas. When she pointed out that this wasn't what she wanted the waitress told her they didn't have any and walked away. adding a 6 charge for the salsas she delivered. n nMy other friend ordered a hamburger. It didn't come with mayo so she asked for some. The waitress brought a small side of mayo. adding a 3 charge to the bill. Notice a pattern here? n nAbout halfway through the burger my friend wasn't looking so hot. She said it tasted funny. In an instant there she goes running to the ladies room to vomit it back up. She came back to the table practically green. n nWe reported this to our waitress who obviously didn't care at all or apologize she simply rolled her eyes, took the burger away and dropped off the bill. After noticing that we had still been charged for the burger in addition to the 6 salsa charge and 3 mayo charge we asked to speak with a manager. n nThe manager approached our table with attitude and before we could even tell him that the burger made me friend sick he said that he already knew and he ""tasted her burger and it tasted fine to me maybe she threw up because of alcohol. "" I explained that we hadn't started drinking yet it was only lunch time. When I brought up the charges for condiments. Seriously?! THREE DOLLARS FOR MAYONNAISE?! I told him ""I've never been charged for condiments at a restau "" he interupted me and said, ""Well, we do. "" I told him they should at least tell people instead of just bringing it out then adding it to the bill. He snipped back ""Oh, well I guess you expect me to comp the whole bill then? "" n nI wasn't going to argue with that. ""Yes, that would be great. Thank you. "" We threw down some cash for the tip only and walked out. n nI'd give them a zero rating if I could. The food made one of us sick, they charge for everything to pad the bill, and the manager that I dealt with was a rude prick. I wouldn't go there again if they paid me.",1
"I had never heard of the Sharp Edge until this past week. We stopped in to grab drinks with our friends who were in from out of town. The atmosphere was very nice not crowded or loud. There's a sweet wall of beer as you walk into the restaurant that summarizes their options. Our first waitress left after taking our order and another waitress took over for our table. I imagine it was the end of her shift, although we didn't get much of an explanation. I thought it was a little odd, but I understand everyone's shift ends sometime. They have a large selection of beers and the ones I had were excellent. We weren't able to have any food but I'd be more than willing to go back and give them a try.",2
"Worst valet in the whole lv area. The desk was empty for 10 mins and asked where they were the door man said over there very rudely. Took them 20 mins to get car with no wait. Was also in the casino and had some one ask me for drugs. Walking thru again was stopped and asked again for drugs. Really hr casino, I'm so glad I spend my bank roll somewhere else.",1
"Another Perfect meal at Del Frisco's! Got a table for 2 right away by booking on Open Table, Perfect Filet Mignon and Crab Cake and Scallops were excellent also! Sides just as good and the Del Salad with Avocado dressing is my favorite salad anywhere! Didn't have room for dessert but the Lemon 7 layer cake is a must!",2
"My boyfriend and I used to live across the street from this place. There's a circle K right by us too, but we would ALWAYS go here. The owner is so friendly and remembers us every time. Super awesome beer selection and a build your own 6 pack for super cheap. Good prices, friendly staff and super convenient!",2
"This was a great find for us. The outside of the building made us question our choice but once we got inside, we were sold. The service was good and included several visits by the owner. Be warned that the drinks are handcrafted so they take a while to get to the table. We all ordered steaks because of the 50 off prices during happy hour 5 7. There was nothing fancy about them. They were cooked right and had an excellent seasoned taste. The truffle Mac and cheese side dish was incredible. Save room for dessert. The donuts melt in your mouth. nBy the time we left at 8pm, the place was packed, mostly with locals. nIt was a 20 cab ride from the strip, but was well worth the trip.",2
"My Vegas trip was last week and I had every intention of writing a Yelp review. And seeing these bad reviews especially, have reaally made me wanna put my two cents in! Wow, I'm shocked at the bad reviews but hey me and my girl had a GREAT TIME! We bypassed the line because we were part of the Night Train tour group. And as we got there my friend and I shared the 100 chair. The price of the chair or daybed or cabana is NOT covered by Night Train. You're on your own for that. But yea it was awesome. My girl and i were treated like royalty! The girls were SUPER attentive and genuinely nice. Even our sandals received rock star treatment. A pool worker immaculately folded a towel and delicately placed our sandals on top. LOL We were so shocked never experienced anything like that before! The pool was the perfect temperature, the music was banging and the crowd was great. WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING BACK!",2
Not just a breakfast place. Have had lunch there a few times and it was fantastic. The absolute BEST prime rib french dip anywhere! The meat is so tender it melts in your mouth. n nVery friendly wait staff and fast service. Have never had to wait for a table. This has become one of my very favorite restaurants. Will try breakfast next time.,2
Not too impressed with the food they didn't even have AC in there. Like how are you not going to have AC living in Az and eating Pho.,1
"Weird show. Rather than focus on the incredible acrobatic feats that were being performed, the spot light was on giant mascot pandas rolling around like Chris Farley in his Chippendales skit. If I had paid for this show, I would have asked for my money back.",1
The worst service I've ever had! The burger I had left me sick for 3 days the first time I came here. The 2nd time I came I waited for 40 minutes just to get a glass of water and greeted. The worst!,1
"Why does this man have a club in Vegas!?! n nThis club is small, with one dancefloor and a small patio in the back. Drinks are standard, but they couldn't make our scooby snacks cuz they had no whipped cream. The guys are less scandalous than the guys you'd find in Tao, but some of them were definitely more creepy. I was busy rejecting this one guy when he told me that he liked being rejected by me. That's when I took it as my cue to run to my guy friend and and beg, ""save me, save me, save me. """,1
"We went to Jasper's Peak courtesy of a Groupon my companion picked up. I'm fairly glad we didn't pay full price considering how disappointed I was with our experience this evening. n nWe ordered the crab dip, the voodoo chicken with added shrimp , and the jambalaya. n nThe crab dip 9 had a nice texture not too wet , but didn't have a distinctive flavor. We doused this liberally with hot sauce, which was a significant improvement. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips, which provided a good contrast with our spiced up version. n nThe voodoo chicken 16 had a delicious smokiness to it, and the shrimp 4 for an additional 4.50 were a nice complement. The jambalaya 16 was weak, thin and not terribly filling. The rice was the best part of the jambalaya as it had time to soak up the sauce, which brings me to my next point. n nThe meats were all nicely done, but it was obvious that they were cooked separately outside of their sauces and assembled later. They were a bit bland unless you were certain that you rolled them about in your sauce. n nThe service could have been significantly better. Our water glasses were often empty for long stretches, and our waitress Rebecca's friendliness seemed forced and artificial. The place was fairly dead, but we weren't checked on until our meals were almost finished. She asked how our food was at that point but didn't even wait for my answer before she walked away. Service was fairly slow throughout the meal, even though I could see our plates waiting on the service counter. n nI wanted to love this place as it is far closer to me than Baby Kay's, but I'm not going to settle for such poor service at this price. n nAlso, the bartender seemed very friendly, guiding the gentleman at the table next to us through a tasting in order for him to make a wine selection. We didn't drink tonight, but I was impressed. n nPros n Quiet. n Large patio area. n Clean. n nCons n No reservation for parties fewer than six. n Service can be spotty.",1
"I love America's Carne Asada, it has been rated the best in the valley several times and I can see why. My co workers and I eat there at least once a week. Spring for the XL burrito extra spicy! Like others have said parking can be a bit of a pain during lunch but it isn't horrible, you can park on the street. 12 for a XL burrito and tamarindo drink is a little expensive compared to your chain fast food joint but this food is WAY better! So worth it!",2
"Studio 3 26 is legit! I get my haircut by Luis and haven't been disappointed once! I was nervous, just having moved to Phx to try someone new, but Peter, the owner, recommended him and he lived up to his billing! nEvery stylist there is talented and friendly.you can tell they all enjoy what they do and where they're at. Peter has done an awesome job at finding the right group of stylists that genuinely care about the quality of their work. n nHighly, highly recommend. Any guy looking for a good cut, go see Luis!",2
"Pretty damn good buffet. I've done the breakfast lunch one. If only there were an easier way to say that.hmm. Anyway, the food is good, if nearly completely meat based. They tend to have fairly exotic meats, such as wild boar or heritage turkeys. Definitely a plus. The only problem for me is that their salads were uniformly piss poor. Especially their Asian style salads wow, downright inedible. Other than that though one of the best buffets in Vegas definitely a battle between Paris and Bellagio.",2
"Definitely underwhelming. The ham, egg and cheese crepe was bland. Service was slow.",1
"I love this place. This restaurant is hands down the best chinese place around the CMU UPitt area. It's kind of hidden in the middle of Craig street so a lot of people don't know about it but it's pretty amazing. I always eat here for their cheap, cheap lunch specials 5.60 entree, side and rice. n nMy favorite dishes here are Black Pepper Steak, the Amazing Chicken and their Pad Thai. n nThe staff is here is usually super nice too, All in all, its a pretty great restaurant and definitely beats Lulu's or Oriental Express.",2
"It is a good price 6 , that's if the guy presses the 6 button and not the 9 one. Also, if he wasn't trying to sell me windshield repair the entire time maybe he would have been paying attention. I think the 4 times I was asked to have my windshield repaired was a bit much. He even pointed to a ""chip "". I made him point it out again and he pointed to another random spot where there was no chip. Not the best car wash, but very quick and easy if you can handle trying to be sold on things you don't need.",1
"Delicious food and amazing service! It's been said several times by other reviewers but the pretzel bread with flavored butters is killer! I had the scallops with granny smith apple mash, yum! S'mores dessert was off the chart with chocolaty goodness! Portion sizes were just right. This is must try, I will definitely be back!",2

"As a burger lover I was really excited to try this place out after having read all the great reviews. We came a little after noon and were seated promptly, though it started filling up quite a bit after that. I ordered the classic burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and split the Campfire S'mores milkshake with my dining companion. The shake was delicious and the alcohol taste was very subtle which I did not mind. It comes with some extra in a tin container and was more than enough for the two of us to share. I was disappointed though that some of the other shakes I wanted to try were only seasonal. n nAs we were waiting I noticed popcorn being brought out to another table twice. I had to ask for some after seeing that and our server acted surprised that none had been brought out. Hmm, wasn't it his job to do it or at least see to it that we got some and didn't he look at our table and see that we had none? By the time our popcorn was brought out our burgers came out a minute later, so we didn't get to enjoy too much of the popcorn. n nWe were debating as to whether we should split a burger or get our own and in the end we each got our own because from what we could see they looked pretty small. Turned out we actually could have split one and it would have been enough for the two of us. Personally that would have been fine for me because I wasn't too thrilled with the burger and have definitely had better. I usually do not mind pickles in my burger but theirs just did not taste good and I had to pick them out. The other greens in my burger did not taste good either. To top it all off I asked for my burger to be cooked well done and it came out pink inside. My burger came with shoestring fries which were ok. They were super skinny so at the end of the meal it looked like I hadn't even touched them. n nIf you are looking for a good burger and fries at the Cosmopolitan I highly recommend the burger at Commes Ca, truly some of the best burgers and fries I've had and for about the same price as what you'd get at Holstein's. Come to Holstein's for the shakes, but just make sure they currently have the flavor you've been wanting to try.",1
"We had a 50 coupon for this place, and with tax and tip it STILL was 130.00. n nAppetizers soup and salad were okay. The 4 different french fries ""compliments of the chef "" were a nice touch. The pork cutlet was HUGE and unremarkable. Mostly, like most of Las Vegas, it was just okay and overpriced. It even falls down by that usual standard, though, because the ambiance is poor, and service was glacial.",1

Ridiculous wait time for counter service and my order was wrong. Not going back as no one corrected the situation. Customer service was minimal.",1
"I didn't like Osaka at all! Service was horrible, we had to ask the waitress twice to get our drinks and the shrimp and fish weren't fresh. I also didn't like that they do not have AYCE. n nOur rolls were okay, I would never go here again!",1
"I've been a long time fan of House of Tricks and Chef Kelly's work there, so it's no surprise that he's bringing it to the waltz, so to speak, just a few blocks away at The Revival. n nWe swung by for lunch today and I had a fantastic short rib sandwich with great fries, while my lunchmates thoroughly enjoyed their grilled cheese, duck sliders, and reuben sandwich. The host and server were quick and took care of things, and while they're still getting their build out situated, the food was completely fantastic. I'm excited to try out dinner.",2
Excellent ceviche! Great place to have a beer and watch a game or two. Chips and salsa are good too !,2
"WOW, I've been to a lot of Subways before, but this is the worst one yet. So, I order one of their featured sandwiches the Turkey, avocado, and spinach sandwich . I tell the sandwich ""artist "" exactly what I want. He puts the turkey and cheese down and when it comes time for the veggies, fails to mention that he is out of spinach. I think that was an important overlooked detail that should've been mentioned at the beginning. but okay. While he finishes making my sandwich, the MANAGER, starts ringing up the order. The artist forgets that it's a Turkey, AVOCADO, and spinach sandwich and has to add the avocado after I kindly remind him. After ringing up and paying for the order, the manager fails to add the avocado to the total and asks for additional money. I ask ""why "", the then start begins a very rude tone. As we walked out of the place, I hear "".some of these people "". I took a deep breathe and kept walking out. Never going back here again. OH, and not mention that their credit card machine was out order and the lettuce was yellow. Just an absolute horrific experience.",1

"Good wine, good food, good service it's as simple as that. We visited on a Saturday evening in June and sat on the patio. In our group, we had a few different red wines and two martinis. No disappointment there. Food wise, we shared bruschetta and flatbreads, both of which were delicious. Only downsides are that the location is not very scenic the patio faces a parking lot and the interior lighting is super dim, especially jarring if you were just out in the sunlight.",2
"Came here with two other people at 6 40, Happy Hour ends at 7 and our waiter didn't arrive to our table until 7 02 announcing that Happy Hour was unfortunately over. We ordered food and drinks and our waters didn't get there til 7 15, so we sat with no drinks for over a half hour. Btw, the place is empty and it's a Thursday. Our friend asked about the Garden Burger which says ""100 Vegan "" on the menu and the waiter lets us know that it's not really Vegan because they put Chipotle Ranch on it and because they use egg to keep it together . n nTheir food is decent at best, the service was horrendous.",1
extremely great service and equeally great food!,2
"I was looking for a new nail salon the other day, and based on the reviews I thought that I would give this place a try. I do have to give them some credit because it was a Saturday afternoon and they were very busy, but I can't say that I was all that impressed by this establishment. The salon was clean, and so were the tools, however, if you are not a regular client don't expect them to pay much attention to you. I only received a pedicure because a wanted to try the place out before I made a commitment to this salon. They did a nice job, however, I don't think that I will be going back. Its a shame that they ignore all of their new customers, because I was really looking forward to make this my go to spot for my custom acrylic nails. I guess the search for a new nail salon continues!",1
"Their employees are the rudest human beings alive. The host are rude and act like they own the joint and the manager Errol is the biggest jerk ever.

"Let me start off by saying I was so completely stoked at the great deal I got with this hotel. I assumed it would be awesome based on how cool the casino looked. n nI have to say this was the absolute worst hotel experience. EVER And no I am not be over dramatic . ok, fine, i will give it 1 16 of a star for the pricing, which should have been an indicator of what was to come. n nLets start off by saying there is absolutely no point to look on their website to judge what your room experience may be. That would be a complete waste of your time. The website does not resemble to room at all. First, the room is completely depressing, barely any lighting and really big, dark furniture. Don't expect to cover up with a cozy comforter, oh that's right, you just get a sheet to cover up with. So at night during the peak of summer you can either sleep with your AC and freeze, or turn it low or off and toss and turn all night b c your so freaking hot. n nLadies, don't plan on straightening your hair which we all know if an absolute essential . That would just be too much to ask. Why you wonder. Well, the moment I plugged in my small straightener, the breaker went off and the bathroom went dark. TWICE and as a result my expensive beauty essential went dead. I made a claim with the hotel and after sending a security guard WTF to my room, I was told that the hotel was not at fault and I was just going to have to deal. n nThe nicest part of the room, I reckon, would be the bathroom. if you like to find a cockroach waiting for you in the morning as you walk into the shower. seriously! n nI would have rather stayed at Hooters, at least I would have left smelling of chicken wings!",1
"NOT SINGLES FRIENDLY! Went here to get a bite before I start work. I ordered 5 servings of nigiri sushi, and one specialty roll. I received ALL of my sushi before I got my warm bottle of Asahi Black or even a glass of water. Which was 28 minutes from when I gave the sushi preparer my order. The sushi preparer was fine but he gave me a bad piece of Surf Clam it was half disintegrating rotting. I told him my problem and he gave me two orders of something else. nI had no one to complain my service to so I just asked for my check from a busser since I still don't know who my server was. n nThe check said my server was Carlos but the guy who was taking my order was some white dude. Overall horrible service and what you'd expect from a typical tourist sushi bar. Never again. And telling everyone I know this place is just pure ass. n nAll the girls that work here are pretty but have zero intelligence and do not bother stepping up when someone is trying to flag them down for an order or help it anything. n nHappy valentines day. n nPros nSushi guy is good prepares them Japanese style small rice mostly protein nFixes mistakes on the fly n nCons nService nService nService nWarm beer nSERVICE n nOverall nUnless you look like money, or have some pretty blonde with you, you're better off eating at Stripburger next door or the food court directly above.

"I love the location and easy parking, but the customer service is a hit or miss here. Some departments are awesome shoes , but some are like a ghost town.

"Gross. The parking lot was full of sketchy people including a guy dressed in fake Marine Corp. gear holding a huge American flag in the rain with a kid as his sidekick, aggressively asking for ""donations. "" Once we got inside, we noticed the floors were filthy and it smelled really, really bad. There were no carts inside the store, or in front of the store so my husband had to go back out into the parking lot to find one. The rest of the store was your average Albertson's but just smaller and more cramped. Weird, weird people shopping in this store. At one point, my son was picking out a box of cereal and a roided out juicehead with biceps the size of watermelons walked past him and said ""f king girly bullshit "" under his breath! Seriously? Over a box of Honey Nut Cheerios? LOL! At least we had something to laugh about for the rest of our trip. The check out line was painfully slow and we had to walk by fake Marine flag guy again, but we got what we needed to stock our hotel room and we know to go somewhere else next time.",1
"This place is horrible in every way. Please do yourself a HUGE favor and do not go here. They are CROOKS and LIARS! n nDoctor STERN is extremely RUDE and treated my son like he was an inconvenience because he had a hard time with the testing process. He then prescribed a treatment plan that caused me great concern, so I decided to get a second opinion from a specialist who confirmed my fears. The specialist confirmed that the treatment plan prescribed by Dr. Stern was 100 wrong for my son. I then phoned the office to change my sons treatment plan and was met with resistance and completely unprofessional behavior. They refused to refund my money for the products I did not need, nor received and refused to cancel the claim so I can use MY insurance for the correct treatment. My insurance company has made many attempts to get the claim cancelled and they still refuse, so my son had to continue to go without the proper treatment he needs to correct his vision issues. I have also called many times, my specialist has called many times and they refuse to return our phone calls. n nSince, I have had to pay for my sons treatment without insurance and Arizona Eye Care has still REFUSED to do the right thing. MY wife even went into the office to resolve this matter and she was met with complete resistance and disrespect, she was even confronted and met with a hostile attitude by the office manager who kicked my wife out of the office and demanded that she never return. ALL WE'RE ASKING IS FOR OUR SON TO RECEIVE THE PROPER TREATMENT AS WE SEE FIT. n nPlease don't waste your time and money at this place. There are many other choices for vision in Anthem and the nearby communities to take a chance with PEOPLE like this.",1
"This is solely a review on the service at this location which was terrible. We were planning on seeing a movie after our dining experience and missed the beginning of our movie because of the lack of service. I literally had to walk over to the service bar and pick up my drink which I visibly saw had been sitting for over 15 minutes after it had been made because our server was nowhere to be found! The food was good as usual but had to wait ridiculously long for our server to process our bill and serve drinks, oh wait. I had to get my own drinks. I recommend you visit the charleston location 4 stars if you value service or simply don't appreciate being ignored. I live nearby this location but travel 3 times as far just to get good service.",1

"Just returned from Dinner. I don't understand the hype. The issue was the food. Service was good. Attentive. nComesquis. Were a good start. Fois gras pout nu was also OK. Not special. Tomato tart was very average. Not unlike something you'd eat on a fast food pizza. nMy Bison rib was good. Vegetable accompaniment was beets tasting substandard. Also came with fries that were just ok. My wife's pork chop was so overcooked it was inedible. After returning to kitchen, the next try was deemed ok. While adequately cooked, the flavor reeked of onions. The pork taste never came through. nDessert was melted vanilla ice cream and ok tasting chocolate pudding. The red wine was also ok. Not great. nFor perspective, this was our fourth dinner in Montreal. All prior dinners ranged from superb . Le Filet to Great.Les 400 coupes. Then along comes Au Pied De Cochon, touted as an absolute must. The reality is that APDC doesn't hold a candle to the top names in Montreal. It is resting on it's laurels. Martin Picard needs to reevaluate the current sad state of this place to return it to it's former glory. nUntil then, I won't return and can't recommend it. n nHaving had the time to sleep and rethink my review above, I can now clarify my negative feelings for last night's meal. n nPrevious reviewers have complained about the lack of service, overwhelming richness of the food and cramped quarters. None of this applied in my case except for cramped quarters which took it's toll at the end of the meal more about that later . n nThis was a case of ill prepared , tasteless and poorly presented food. The only exception to this was the Cromesquis which were an enjoyable start to the meal. n nFoie gras pout nu. This was not NAKED as advertised. It was covered with a thick balsamic reduction which totally overwhelmed the flavor. And far from being large ,the portion of foie gras was somewhat skimpy given the price. n nTomato tartlet.this dish lacked flavor. The tomatoes we're flavorless.very pedestrian dish. n nHappy Pork Chop. As stated above, this was overcooked to the point of being inedible. The next version provided by the kitchen was cooked well but the preparation required seasoning and was overwhelmed by an onion taste. n nBison Rib. I thought it worked well enough. Just nothing to write home about .vegetables on the side were almost unidentifiable. French fries were ok to good. n nWine. The selected red wine tasted cooked. Just OK n nChocolate pudding.good but indistinguishable from other average versions. n nVanilla ice cream. Hard to mess this up but it arrived half melted. n nAs for seating. we were seated in a 2 top at the front of the restaurant. This worked well enough until a large party arrived and were seated in front of our table along the window. Elders in the group required space to the point where the gentleman in back of me was now seated alongside of me and the woman to his side cramped my legroom as I was now pressed against my table not knowing whether to laugh or cry. I was exteremely uncomfortable as the hostess looked upon the situation with horror. n nI couldn't wait to leave. The manager approached. When I described the litany of my experience I focused on the kitchen line as the culprit. He , in the end, agreed. n nMy bill came to 200 dollars. Not a bad price except when you consider how appalled we were by the quality of the food. n nAs I stated above, when you compare APDC to the other top restaurants in Montreal, please be warned. Go elsewhere.",1
"Cannot say enough good things about North Valley Dermatology. After being diagnosed with acne by another dermatologist and seeing no improvement after years of treatment, I was very, very frustrated and called North Valley Dermatology after seeing them in the ""Top Docs "" issue of Phoenix Magazine. I got an appointment with Dr. Magne. I was booked about three months out not ideal obviously. But when I later asked one of their Med Assistants why I could not get in sooner, I was told that between high demand for services Arizona has the second highest rate of skin cancer in the entire world! Only Australia is worse and a high number of uninsured underinsured people, Arizona has a severe shortage of dermatologists. They've since added a couple of Physician Assistants to help lighten the load. When I finally saw Dr. Magne, she told me that my problem was not acne, but rosacea, which requires a completely different medication and skin care regimen than acne! Within weeks of finally starting the right treatment, my skin had vastly improved. n nI also have a fair complexion and a family history of skin cancer, so Dr. Magne performs yearly skin cancer checks on me and has removed a couple of moles that were definitely suspicious. One of the PA's treated my husband for a scary looking skin lesion that turned out to be harmless. The staff is always courteous and professional and they call back with lab and test results quickly. Their office in Peoria which they moved into a few years back is a very warm and pleasant environment. The medical practice shares space with their aesthetic medspa called Original Skin where you can get a full compliment of facials, makeup and cosmetic procedures like Botox. Not really my thing, but as others have noted, they don't try to hard sell you on the cosmetic stuff. It is there, and if you ask, they will provide you with a list of their services, but no one will pressure you into buying. I did ask once about facials, and was given an extensive list. Alas, none are recommended for people with rosacea. But if they ever come up with a rosacea safe facial, I just might be interested! n nI would recommend North Valley Dermatology without hesitation to anyone needing a good dermatologist in the Phoenix area. Great people and great care.",2

"Since the hotel looks like a castle and my boys loved that part of it and my oldest really enjoyed the Tournament of Kings show and the Fun Dungeon, I will give the hotel one star. The beds were also super comfortable! n nNow the reasons for the lack of stars. nAfter arriving in Las Vegas for our first time, the airport shuttle dropped us off at the hotel with a 9 year old, a 2 year old, and 8 bags, we walked into the hotel only to find that we were dropped off in the rear of the hotel and was very rudely informed by a security guard that there was a phone to call a bell hop. After 3 attempts to call the bell hop and being put on hold for extended periods of time, we gave up and walked to the complete opposite end of the hotel to check in. Once arriving at the opposite end of the hotel there was a line to wait in which took an hour to check in. nWe finally get to our room and request more towels and such since there are 4 of us and only 3 sets of towels. We go to eat and when we come back, the towels are on the counter in the bathroom. I lift up one of the towels to move it and there is a large clump of dark hair on the towels which I can understand being missed in the probably massive amounts of laundry that the hotel has to do it the day, but similar instances happened on 3 occassions. One time clumps of hair, second time brown stains on the mats, and the third time brown stains on a towel. All of these on 3 different days and 3 different occassions. That is not forgiveable. nThe first impression is everything! nOn day 3 of being at the hotel and out walking around for 6 7 hours we were sore and wore out when we got back to the hotel and we decided to take turns going to get massages at the spa. I went first. When I got down to the spa I wanted to add on a foot rub to my 25 minute massage but apparently it takes 2 different people to make a back massage and foot massage happen and even though it is a total of 50 minutes of massages between the 2, I was told it would take an hour and a half. So I cancel the foot massage because my boyfriend's massage we only an hour after mine. I go back to the women's locker room and the girl sitting at the desk says that I am already running on my time and I have to shower before I can get my massage. So I am thinking that she means that I am using up my 25 minutes worth of massage so I explain that my appointment isn't until 4 30 it was currently 4 20 . Her response was that my time starts 15 minutes before my appointment. I rinse off with water and proceed to wait in the sitting area for my massage. I bring it up to the girl checking people in that it should be explained to people when they set up an appointment that they need to tell people that they need to be there early. She argues back that they did. My boyfriend was literally still on the phone making the appointments when I left the room and headed to the spa. Now the hotel may be big, but it is definitely not that big. As I am struggling with the staff there are 2 other women who openly share their dissatisfaction with the spa also for different reasons. One told me that I would pay more if I went to the Luxour or the MGM but I looked up the prices for massages at them and they were very similar to the Excalibur prices. If I would have known that before my massage, I would have happily taken my business elsewhere. I was there to relax, not be rushed by someone. nSome other things that were a problem are. n1. The timeshare people always bothering you. n2. The amount of smoke was terrible. n3. The one time we went to the Lobby Lounge for drinks the bartender was slow and the ratio on both my drink and my boyfriends was completely off. n4. Only offered one show and that was the Tournament of Kings. A word to the wise, you can get the souvenir cups for 8 at the 24 7 store upstairs instead of paying 14 at the show n nOverall, it is waaaay better than Circus Circus to stay if you have kids but the kid amenities can be visited without being a hotel guest. We will not stay here next time.",1
Brandon and Elliot did an awesome job helping us move in! We moved from California to AZ using a Uhaul. He helped get everything unloaded.

"This place isn't really a strip club. There aren't a bunch of girls trying to tackle you for your 20 per song and the girls that are there would rate somewhere between a 5 and an 8. n nThis place isn't really a dance club either. It's got huge video screens that play the music videos from the songs they're playing though the video is a bit out of sync with the actual music and no one is dancing, well except the wigglers. n nIt's not a strip club because they play really long songs sometimes without cutting them short. n nIt's not a dance club because most of the patrons there are just guys who think it's a strip club. n nIt mostly just comes across as a sad dysfunction between the two with a location that's far removed from The Strip near Orleans and a 30 cover that just makes you feel like you were ripped off when you leave. n nI actually started the review giving these guys three stars, but now that I've re read it, I'm moving it down to two. if you want to dance, go to Late Night Empire or Drai's. If you want a strip club, then ask your limo driver you're not still driving around in taxi's are you? .",1

"Another one of my recent Hawaiian food finds, this one, like many other Hawaiian restaurants around town, comes equipped with your standard foods and pleasant service Why are Hawaiians so dang happy and friendly all the time? Clearly it's the food. . n nThere's two big differences about Aloha Kitchen that make it one of my preferred Hawaiian places n n1. The inside is actually a really nice place to sit and enjoy a meal. You can take out if you want, but if you aren't in a rush, you can sit and relax a spell in a nice, clean, comfortable albeit small dining area, and enjoy your food at your own pace. Some Hawaiian places feel like they're being run out of a box, and that's fine when doing take out or delivery, but sometimes you want to stay and enjoy the food right from the kitchen. n nAnd n nB. There's something about the mahi mahi here. It's amazeballs. Now, I'm not a big judge on authenticity, I've never been to Hawaii, I don't know how the locals make it, but I'm a big fan of their food and eye candy, and in both I know what tastes I like. Heyooooo. So while other places fry their mahi mahi and that's tasty, don't get me wrong, me and fried are best buddies , Aloha Kitchen uses, like, this egg batter, then kinda flash fries it. It's hard to explain, but it's SO GOOD. You get the mahi mahi, and you're like, ""Hey, Aloha Kitchen, you can't fool me! I ordered fish, not an omelete! "" It seriously looks like you ordered an omelete, but you bite in and it's delicious Hawaiian fish that's A Mahi Mahi MAZING. n n ""A Mahi Mahi MAZING "" trademark 2012 R.

Stopped in on the way to work for a breakfast burrito. I ordered the Machaca and Egg burrito and while it was ok about halfway through the grease started to soak through so much the filling was falling out of the bottom of the tortilla. At that point I just was kinda grossed out and threw out the rest of the burrito. Luckily it was a huge burrito so I had my fill on by that point anyways. Doubt I'll go back when I know Filiberto's isn't too far away.,1
"HORRIBLE! Do NOT come here. I am not high maintenance whatsoever so this comment is left without bias. I work close by and needed a quick polish change. I only had 45 minutes. I asked for cost, i was quoted 20 and told I would be out asap. It took the nail tech 1hr for a gel change. My results look as if a teenager trying to make extra money on the side completed the job. I have polish on my cuticles, top coat on my skin that is very annoying AND the kicker, i was charged an additional 5 to remove some existing gel even though I was not told of the extra cost prior AND I had already taken off half of the gel myself hence why I needed a polish change.

My best friend and I were going to Vegas for her bday and she's never been before. She really wanted to go see Holly Madison because of her show and I said I would go along.

"I've shopped at this Smiths 10 times a month for about the last 3 years and I'm pretty happy with it. The staff is very friendly, the store is kept clean and they generally have everything I need. The one deficiency is the produce department. They have a good selection of items, but there are times they are out of things and may not have them for a day or two. This issue has gotten worse over the last year or so since there has been some turn over in that department. Obviously, this doesn't stop me from shopping at this Smiths location, but be forewarned that this may be a problem. That being said, if this is your neighborhood store it will still do you well.",2
"While I do love beaver tails to the extent that I'd be okay with getting diabetes from them , this is not what I remember it was. n nI ordered a 5 ""Avalanche "". Basically a cheese and nuts beaver tail. While it was good, it seemed rather expensive for 6 Taxes. The beaver tail itself seems much thinner than what it used to be a few years ago. I also remember more toppings were added before although the length is the same, surely so it LOOKS good from the top but feels like a disappointment in the mouth. Also it was served to me almost cold. that was not really appreciated. The only reason I didn't make a scene to get a hot one is because my friend was with me at the time. n nPrices are disappointing for what is being served to us. Selection is OKay. Time to prepare is a bit below average for just a piece of fried dough with a topping squeezed out of a bottle. Mine was served almost cold on top of it. n nHonestly when I think about it, I finished the beaver tail because I'm a fatty food lover, not because it was actually good if that makes any sense to you guys . n nNot recommending the place. Quality went down a lot after it became almost a chain in Montreal. You'd be better off stuffing your face with Churros from Costco to be honest. n nAlso they don't take debit credit? Really? What the fuck.",1
"First off, I should comment that my husband made a reservation for the wrong restaurant and at 7 pm on a Friday night, we got right in. n nOther than that, my experience was less than gratifying. n nThe calamari fritti was good, sauce was pretty good. n nI was pretty upset to find that the menu on the website is not even a representation of the menu provided in the restaurant. The website says copyright 2012, but Ferraro's does NOT serve Eggplant Parmigiana as stated on their website, nor is their Chicken Parmigiana 20. It was 24. Also, I've NEVER been to an ITALIAN restaurant that serves broccoli, carrots and POTATOES potatoes!? seriously?! with ANYTHING in marinara sauce. Especially since the menu both on the website and IN THE RESTAURANT says ""served with pasta. "" n nNOT IMPRESSED. Still searching for a REAL ITALIAN restaurant outside of NY.",1
"I was really surprised to see all of the positive reviews for The Desert Rose because my experience was not a positive one. First the good things I am a Shell Owner so staying here is part of my plan but from what I hear the place is a great value for a location this close to the strip. The lobby is nice and our room was also well decorated despite some shabby furniture. n nBut the biggest problem we experienced at the Desert Rose were the cockroaches, and when I say cockroaches, I don't mean one little beetle like bug, I mean that once the sun went down the entire grounds were infested with them running all over the paths, up the exterior walls, in the elevator and unfortunately in our room. n nI happen to be deathly afraid of insects, all insects. My husband took me to a butterfly conservatory once and I nearly had a stroke so when we parked and went to bring in our bags and saw the nasty little buggers all over the path to our room I just about had a nervous breakdown especially since this is Vegas and you have on cute little strappy sandals, not army boots to protect your feet. But once I made it to the door of our room I thought I was home free until I saw them on the door to the room. Finally my husband cleared the way and in we went. Not ten minutes later we placed our first call to the front desk about the fact that we had several roaches in our room. They were not surprised to hear this and said they' d send someone to spray. n nThis helped for a day or two but soon our guests were back. Several in the bathroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room and though it traumatizes me to write it, one on the sofa that ran across my lap while watching TV! We complained to the front desk to which the woman responded, ""Well, we're in the valley and it is summertime. "" As if by some strecth of the imagination a roach infested room is seasonally acceptable! They offered us a second floor room, reasoning that they may not be AS BAD upstairs. Well, in truth they weren't that bad but they were still there and I still had to run screaming down the paths if we were out at night. The registration desk said that they would offer us a discount on the room, but since we are owners there was nothing they could do for us. Unfortunately complaints made to Shell Vacations Club later went unanswered. n nThe pool area was kind of dirty with bandaids in the water, cigarette butts and roach carcasses around the pool. I loved Las Vegas but I would never stay at The Desert Rose again, no matter what the season!",1
"I have been here twice and had 2 different experiences. The first time we liked what the menu looked like so we had lunch here. Food was good, standard bar food so nothing overly special but good. Service was decent, it was not busy so we were checked on regularly. We found out they have the UFC fights so we wanted to go here to watch them. Fight night we show up and it is 10 per person! What!?! Every other place in EV only charges 5 pp. We were already there and they were just about to start so we stayed. Next our waitress informs us that she needs a credit card or id as a security for the table. What?!? We are a 40 something couple, you think we are going to dine and dash.really. After a bit of discussion, I reluctantly give up my card. Then the fights start but because it is March Madness, not all the TV's are turned to the fight as they said they would be. So I have to crank my neck in order to watch them, even after the game ended they still did not turn the tv's. nThe food again was ok and service was good so we will go back for food but not to watch a fight, I will stick with Old Chicago or Tilted Kilt for my UFC viewing.",1
"Update 9 23 14 Downgrade to one star n nI spent an hour on the phone this morning with my insurance company. Here I have a procedure that will likely relieve me 30 years of pain or at least reduce it a lot and what is happening? n n1. Blue Cross Blue Shield will cover having everything done in one procedure so my time off upaid and recovery upaid and need for a ride hard to find when everyone I know works days are better for me and one sedation and one procedure is less risk of complications and infection. n2. I got a call back from Innovative Procedural and Surgical Center saying they follow Medicare guidelines even though I'm not on Medicare and Medicare requires the procedure be done on one side, then wait 2 weeks and do the other side. They didn't even address the fact they said they were in network and they are not and one part of the business is and one part isn't and they didn't bother to inform me? n nREALITY Blue Cross Blue Shield will cover having it all done at once but the 2nd side is considered the same area and is covered at a reduced rate. By splitting it into two procedures they are increasing their reimbursement but it is absolutely not medically necessary nor is it required by my insurance company. n nSince they won't make the MEDICALLY CORRECT decision because it isn't to their financial advantage, I now have to consider alternative pain management which is bound to be drugs. nTwenty five years of pain and there's a glimmer of hope to not be in pain and this is what happens? I have no complaints about the quality of care. They definitely know what they are doing but ETHICS of the business side are questionable. n nSooooo. off I go to file a complaint with the board and my insurance company which means my chance of getting quality care from this facility are now zero. n nHow depressing is that? n nSo I have had the 2 uncomfortable test procedures and it seems the bigger procedure is likely to work. Now the problem. two procedures one for each side of my spine? why? Insurance won't pay for both sides? Hard to believe. Working through that with staff because I know insurance is a pain in the ass for everyone. n nBUT now I have billing problems. I made sure to ask at the first appointment if they were in network. WELL. one part of the business is and one isn't and NO ONE bothered to mention that. It's a mess. n nAm I supposed to be a mind reader? After 30 years of pain, pain, pain there's finally a glimmer of hope of some relief and I just want to getting it done yet nothing is ever easy. n nI just want to be pain free and I've managed to managed a pretty crunched back with little no meds for decades. Hope in the procedure and hopelessly entangled in a mess! n nThe first specialist I saw couldn't believe I could walk. I'm blessed I'm even mobile so now the one procedure that can take away the pain is within reach yet so distant it's not even funny! n n. and if anyone wonders why there are so many drug addicts, this would be it. The alternatives are so hard to get! I'm sort of fortunate that I'm hypersensitive to all the drugs everyone else gets addicted to so they work but make me puke! n nIf anyone knows their way around BCBS coding and wants to help, write me privately. This is a joke.",1
"There are a ton of Salvadorian restaurants throughout Las Vegas. Big ones, small ones, mini chains, etc. I've tried a few, but keep coming back to this one. Maybe its because one of my best friends is a Salvadorena, or maybe it is because I've never met a Salvadoreno I didn't like, but the namesakes of this place are amazing. I've had many different kinds of the pupusas here, but on my last visit I had the been and cheese. They were like heaven. Each bite more delicious than the last. I also had an order of plantains.can't get enough of these, and Las Pupusas does them just as good as any of the Cuban restaurants in town. The group I was with all had different things carne asada, pupusas, salad, etc. and all were very very happy with their selections. It was a Wednesday night around 6 30, and the place was pretty busy mind you, this place is big for a ""hole in the wall "" .mostly families but a fair share of people picking up dinner to take home. nI particularly like this place because they are patient. Sometimes when you don't speak the language the staff can be really impatient, or even rude.not the case at Las Pupusas, they are very friendly, very patient and will make substitutions if you ask nicely. My meal of 3 pupusas, plantains and water was around 6 and I was super full. I don't know anywhere else where I can get this feeling that is not the Terrible's Buffet or Cici's Pizza in Las Vegas.",2
Some people have difficulty grasping the concept of Planet Fitness. It's just high quality fitness equipment geared at getting you in shape. No glitzy smoothie bars or aerobics classes for ladies to get all dressed up trying not to sweat. The attendants are pleasant and readily answer questions. The Lunk Alarm can be a little irritating but you overlook that after awhile. Keep doing what you do Planet Fitness because I'm a fan!,2
"New Years Eve here was a major disappointment. The tickets we purchased indicated that we would be served top shelf liquor with this all inclusive ticket, but we were served some no name vodka, and the Crown Royal ran out within 30 minutes of being there. There was also no fruit to go with any of the cocktails. nThe bathrooms were absolutely atrocious. Honestly, I have never seen anything like it, and I hope I never do again. nGenerally speaking, it was poorly executed and a colossal waste of money for my group of 15. I won't be back.",1
"After reading the fairly positive reviews we decided to give Cafe Zamora a try. What a mistake that was as it was some of the worst mexican food we've eaten. I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and the chicken was so dry and looked like a dry sponge. I complained to my wife and she thought I was being picky and tried a piece and had to spit it out. n nIt appeared as if the chicken was precooked and sat in a tub in a cooler for a month. When they served it they drowned it in a liquid the liquid covered my entire plate even over the beans and rice and heated it in a microwave. The chicken was flavorless and the consistency of a dry sponge. I could not tell if the beans and rice were any good due to them being covered in the liquid from the fajitas. When they sat the plate in front of me it looked more like a bowl of soup than a meal of fajitas, beans and rice. n nThe only good thing was the salsa which had a great flavor and was served cold. n nWe'll never go back.",1
"I use to go to K town all the time in LA and still do when I visit so I know my Korean BBQ and this place sucks. n nSo the service started out good, lady was nice when you walked in but if you are not Korean you dont' get any service, no steamed egg, no soup don't think I want the soup either, saw a waitress taste one with the spoon and put the spoon back in then brought it another table . We got three sides and the kimchee smelled fishy, I have eaten a lot of kimchee and this is the first that smelled like that, they didn't even give us the soy sauce dip till we asked for it. n nService at all asian places suck but this is below bad, what if you have never tried korean BBQ before, do you not get the banchan? n nAs for the meat selection, it's a joke for AYCE, n One order of short ribs allowed, it was not good n One order of sirloin and it was chewy n Bugolgi was way too sweet and really fatty n Brisket, only thing edible nDid not try the rest, just stuck with the brisket since the rest was so bad. n nTowards the end we had to waive down someone to just bring us more ice tea. n nThis was the first and last time for this place.",1
"Delicious food, amazing staff, good price. I came here for the buffet and found out they had mango lassi on tap! This place is a gold mine, by far best punjabi style Indian buffet in all of az. Will definitely be back again!",2
"Rude ! They lie on the website . For instance, the details about the room are scams . Youll find a 1990 TV and so on .Moreover, service is bad , I won't recommend it at all .",1
"Big hot latte, a date and walnut scone warmed through in an oven not a micro and a dollop of clotted cream and homemade strawberry jam. Add to that a very happy pregnant lady serving with smiles all round and you've got the perfect recipe for a mid morning 'fly cuppa'. Little bit crowded but great none the less. nWill be coming back this way again!.hope she was with child and I haven't made another classic Al faux pas.",2
"I love Sweet Frog! n nThey always have new flavors and a huge variety of toppings.my favorite is the strawberry syrup! Its delicious! Fruit, candy, chocolate, cake, brownies you name it they have it! n nWhat's very cool is that the machines are set up so that you can either have one flavor or a mix of both! n nYou make everything yourself, pick your yummy flavor, pile on the toppings and weigh it at the end! n nLove, Love, Love it!",2
"3 stars for the food, but I have to give it an extra star for the view of the strip! We sat right on the patio and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio and of the attractive and at times not so attractive people walking by the strip! The burgers here are good, but don't try the crepes very flavorless! I highly recommend ended your meal with a latte! It was the best latte I've ever had!",2
"Poor service once again, several empty tables, so it's not that busy where we should be ignored by our waiter. When my drink is empty I consider it a bad thing. My son' drink was emptied half way through his meal, we would have ordered him more but we never saw the waiter. Steve was in attentive and as we finished out meal all four if our glasses were empty. I'm sorry that's not good in my book. He didn't offer dessert he asked if we were all finished. I think we found another restaurant to mark off our list. Food was good though!",1
This place is so disappointing. 10.50 while you make it and a cool cooks it for you? Totally not worth the money. Very bland tasting and highly overpriced. They charged 50 cents for a takeout box? What is that?,1
"First impression when we walked in the door.everybody said in unison ""What the hell is that smell! "" nSmelled like Sh!t. Seriously. Good thing our friend had room deodorizer in her possession, which we're still wondering why. nThe room was large which was expected because all their rooms were suites. It's a lil difficult for me to not be biased from what I've been used to. I'm a regular at the Wynn, Encore and Palazzo but we got this room Comped so we took advantage of it and accepted it as.well. Comped. The wall decors looked like they've been renovated but most everything else was out dated. The couch, carpet and drapery were typical 90's. The restroom was very basic. Nothing to brag about. There's no luxurious feel whatsoever but then again, it's not the theme. The plumbing for the two sinks need some work. I can hear the gurgling every time one of them is used. Wifi was not complementary and the TV channels were very limited. The outlets were broken. I mean the wall socket plastic cover was shattered revealing the inner walls and the actual socket was loose. When I tried to plug my phone charger to it, it turned off the alarm clock. Yes there's a short. Isn't this a fire hazard? nThe beds were comfortable. The linens were clean. Loss my butt off on Blackjack but that has nothing to do with the room. Had a great weekend nonetheless. n noh forgot. It's a No Smoking floor but the entire freaking hallway was reeking of Cigarette Smoke. WTF? When we opened the door to go out, it's as if somebody was smoking outside and blowing it directly towards our door for us to take a huge whiff of. We even laughed about it. We get Cig smoke going out and Sh!t smell coming in.",1
Went for brunch today by suggestion of a friend and was very pleasantly surprised. Our server was very friendly and attentive and helped us with the menu and any questions we had. Some of the things that made me love this place was 1 the bottomless champagne brunch 2 the food was great. I got the green Chile burger substitute for chicken and it was delish ! 3 BOTTOMLESS CHAMPAGNE. n nI will be going again!,2
Visited it yesterday. The design inside is pretty simple feels like aquarium. Sushi are overpriced and not good as expected. Not worth to visit at all.,1
"Did someone die in my room? n nI had to make a last minute reservation for a hotel the week of the CES show. And if I had 500, I would have taken my benjamins elsewhere. But I didn't so I ended up booking at the once luxurious in 1973 Imperial palace. n nWhen I got there, they only had smoking rooms available. I figured one night, shouldnt be that bad. I mean all of vegas smells like smoke. WRONG. opened the door and totally could not escape the stale smell that came wafting off the floors and walls. n nI go in, and the room is dark, lampshade is crooked, and a chair is faced looking outside the balcony which overlooks a parking garage. n nI'm pretty sure someone, at least one person, had OD'd in that room. You could feel the history in that place. Im also sure the linens were hand woven from the lingerie of a thousand dead hookers. That ish was RIPE. n nVegas is vegas, and you probably won't sleep all that much there anyhow, but if you have no other options for a hotel other than IP, find them somehow because this hotel was something else.",1
"Not impressed one bit! After seeing the menu online I was very excited to try a new restaurant close to home. It was nothing special, AT ALL! The BBQ chicken salad I ordered had a very slim amount of the ingredients mixed in and it maybe, maybe, had 2 ounces of chicken breast. My daughter had the chicken strips and fruit from the kids menu. She's a toddler and eats ketchup with most items. They didn't have ketchup. The lobster bisque soup was okay. A small salad was not enough food and was not offered a size portion when I ordered it. The bread that comes with the meal is just a section of a cold hard loaf and the butter is over ice so there's no way you're spreading that on your hard loaf. The chocolate covered strawberries were a disappointment as well. Only less than half of the strawberry was dipped. Sad to say it but this place doesn't stand a chance with the other restaurants in the shopping center",1
"Not really sure how to go about this review. but one thing i do know is that Archie's has a great wing! Another awesome thing is that their wing night is Monday THROUGH Thursday. 35 cents. This includes regular wings AND boneless Score! n nJust an FYI though. you have to order them by 10wings. Also, only one flavor per 10 wings. n nI normally order the boneless but forgot to mention it to our server. The regular wings were not bad at all! I believe I ordered the teriaki and Bobby ordered the Honey BBQ. I tried both and they were great!",2
"Went there last night, had so much fun. n the crowds were not that bad, around 9pm it was starting to get really busy. nthe food prices were fair. and very good choices n Had a blast on the rides and enough campy lounge singers to round out the night , nGood times",2
"If I could give this NO STARS I would! It is the worst place possible to send a patient here 3 weeks after Open Heart Surgery with NO doctor on staff only on call. The nurses did their best, but I suffered greatly by having medical emergencies 4 out of 5 days. Upon arriving here late at night, I was put in a room and never attended to for 45 minutes. The stay was awful. No choice of any food, you eat what they give you. Or,you don't eat at all. NO DOCTOR came when I had these emergencies and had to be sent to another hospital. Three blocks away, the ambulance charge was 1,000. Sent back here again and had a very dangerous medical problem, sent to another hospital. My insurer doesn't use the ""best "" only the cheapest. If you have someone you love or yourself, REFUSE TO GO HERE! I was threatened by my insurer that if I did not go here my hospital bill which was over 500,000 would not be paid nor would I be reimbursed for nursing care at home. To go here Three WEEKS after major surgery is just wrong!",1
"I recently discovered heaven on water in Montreal. If you want some real R R and little bit of nosh then make your way to Bota Bota, spa sur l'eau.

"Extremely good massage. 38 for an hour. Ive had hundreds of massages and this was in the top 3. Yes, it is hard to find, and yes the mega strip mall this place is located in feels a little like the set of Mad Max, but Its a safe area, close to the Wynn and strip, and a great deal. Must try!",2
"I'm not a huge Michael Mina fan, but have had a couple good meals at Arcadia in San Jose and Michael Mina when it was in the St. Francis. Was this a mind blowing meal? No. Was this a great meal across a baffling menu that some how pulled off Seafood, Sushi Rolls, Asian and Italian? Yes. n nHere were the highlights n Spicy Diver Scallops n Tataki Roll n Yellowtail Sashimi n Brussel Sprouts and Cipollini Onions n nAte a bunch of other stuff, but none of that was really memorable recommendable if that's a word.",2
"True Story n nI heard that Robert McGrath was renovating the old Smoke Tree Resort. Drove by a few times and then noticed the REM sign It was kirei board! and there was a small hand written sign beside the door with the hours posted for lunch. I should backup and say that this occurred last July 2007. We went for lunch, walked in the door, no one around, went towards the restaurant and noticed a group of 3 guys having lunch. There was an old school vibe, no music, old school furniture, and also new silverware selections, drawings and blueprints on a large cluttered table, etc. n nThe waiter comes out a few minutes later and brings the menu 3 items A salad, pulled pork sandwich, and a chili I think. The menu was printed on a sheet of paper, bold lettering, no descriptions, so classic. just the item and the amount. It was pretty obvious that they were either testing menu items, or., not sure why else that it would be open?! The experience was worth us coming back again. So anyway, we came back the following week. Nothing had changed, same old school, stumbled upon feeling. n nAt the end of our meal, we realized that we didn't have any cash! Sharing this with the waiter, he actually said ""That's ok, pay me the next time you come in. "" ! How cool is that? We scoured her handbag, my wallet and came up with just enough. n nI am looking forward to REM opening maybe I can have the same deal?",2
Don't waist your time here. Service is BLAH and food is nothing special. Their happy hour food is a joke. One star for the beer and one star for their free chips and salsa.,1
"My friend saw Bachi Burger featured on the Food Channel, and so we ventured off the Strip to try it. There were 10 of us, and the service was slow. Our table was set up, but somehow it took another 10 minutes to seat us. It was 20 minutes from ordering to getting our food. However, once we were finished, they were in a big hurry to clear our plates. n nFood Review nRonin Burger quality meat and tasty bun, overalll good flavor nKalbi Burger a burger with Korean flavorings, we found the kimchi to be too sweet nOx Tail Chili Fries little ox tail, IMO, not worth 11 nVietnamese Coffee watererd down, not really Vietnamense style nSweet Potato Fries crispy and tasty a hit at our table nParmesian Truffle Fries fries were tasty, although most in our group didn't care for the gravy nCaesar Salad a little too cheesy for us n nFor 20 person including tip, it's pretty steep for what you get.

"Listen, this is THE BEST italian restaurant. Ever. Ive been to many italian restaurants and it's my first time here, Very welcoming staff I think it was the owner It was my friends birthday so I reserved and the guy over the phone told me he'd take care of everything. We had mixed salad and penne perfection. Cocktails, Then dessert with a sparkling candle for my girl's birthday. It looked like chocolat lava or something and ice cream on the side.THANK U!",2
"Huge rooms. Soft towels. Comfortable bed with tons of pillows. nThree things that make me happy when I'm traveling. n nWhat's wrong with this place, then? First of all, the location is central to nothing aside from the mall which houses several chain restaurants. Second, the staff could not care less about pretty much anything. While the woman who checked us in was helpful and friendly, that was the end of that. Despite requesting my Hilton status ""amenities "" just a package of snacks and water.not much , I never received it. I was also charged 30 for internet when I shouldn't have paid a thing got the bill corrected at check out . And housekeeping didn't leave enough towels or replace the water. n nConsidering we paid over 200 a night, the blase attitude of the staff is very disappointing.",1
"Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years. On that fact alone they receive 5 stars from me. n nDo they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has? I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. n nI had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get. n nThe interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the ""hood "" but who cares. Darn good fish and chips IMHO. n n PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing. Ranch makes everything better!",2
"I've stayed in a lot of hotels over the years. I've stayed in some Doubletrees and usually come away much less than impressed. Then I stayed here. n nThe rooms, the suite we had, was enormous. Large living room with a small wet bar and fridge. Huge L shaped desk. Large television and a nice little balcony with two chairs and a table. The bedroom was just as large as the living room. The bed was comfortable but not outstanding, the linens and pillows however were wonderful. The only somewhat critical comment I would make about the room is that I think, given the large proportions of the other rooms, the bathroom was small. With that much space they should have built stand up showers. That said, the generous sized tub made showering simple and pleasant. The low water flush toilet sounds like a jet taking off but unless one spent all the time flushing toilet I can't see how that matters. During our stay we never heard noise from other rooms of the hall. n nThe real surprise was the staff. The staff was much better than I ever would have expected from a Doubletree. From the desk staff to housekeeping they were all friendly, pleasant and very helpful. The staff in the bar and restaurant were also delightful. All of these people helped make my stay in Charlotte very pleasant. n nThe next time I am in Charlotte I would definitely stay at the Doubletree Suites again.",2
"If you are active or family of the military check out the new USO suite in Terminal 4. Also, I was most impressed with the , ""Lost and Found "" service I received last week. They literally got back to me in less than an hour. Nice job Sky Harbor! I can't wait until the Sky Train opens too.",2
Service was great and food was good bar grub. Onion rings club sandwich were both tasty. Horrible beer choices nSMOKEY interior brought this place down. n nTypical macro beers and maybe one fake micro were only taps. n nTried the patio but it was too hot and most drivers taking the corner seem to be trying out for Grand Prix racing team.,1
The chicken fundido is excellent. The margeuritas are delicious. I'm not sure that I like the duck turtle pond.it seems a little gross. There are lots of birds on the patio so we always eat inside .,2
best people watching in my life ever!,2
"Keep your beloved pets away from this unprofessional place. A few months ago I took my young kitten into Dr. Pence at AZ Spay Neuter for a typical spay for her. The surgery was done the same day by the Dr. Pence himself and later that day I picked her up seemingly without any complications. Nearly a week went by when it was detected that the kitten was in pain with a dis coloring on the belly area that exacerbated each day. Little did I know from a routine surgery, but Dr. Pence according to a professional vet who corrected the mistake failed to properly stitch up the fibrosis layer tissue and subsequently internal bleeding was causing the dis colorization. I asked him how such a simple routine procedure by someone who bragged about their 35 years of experience could be so botched? In response he had nothing at all to say in his defense and was not remorseful in the least for his mistake if not confrontational about it when contacted. Needless to say I took my kitten to a real vet to have the damaged caused by AZ Spay Neuter repaired to the tune of 500 asking the clinic to at least help with the expensive bills of which they refused. So that response to it and the terrible job that nearly killed my little kitten over their negligent surgery, is reason for this terrible review on a nightmarish experience.",1
"Great food, not Greek, but Lebanese. The menu isn't too big but everything is made fresh to order. Staff very helpful and out going.",2
"Great. Never would have expected greek gyros driving by the place. n nWe had great service, all the food was delicious and down to earth.",2
"I must confess, this review is way way over due. And there is not excuse, though if you would accept that the dog ate my review I might try and tell you that is exactly what happened. In actuality I was looking through my reviews today and noticed this one was never written. nThe hubby and I went to tuck shop in November. Yup, that long ago. We stopped in before enjoying the art walk. I'm a really big fan of the location, I love all the historic homes, any excuse to drive through these lovely neighborhoods works for me. And the building they are housed in, beautiful. I really love how they set this up. The dining room is lovely and I look forward to taking advantage of using the huge table in the middle of the dining room for a birthday or other celebration in the future. nService was good, our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. I really love the bottled tea they served. nNow for the important part, the reason I am writing this review so long after the fact the chorizo stuffed dates, covered in gouda. OMG. I mean really. OMG. These suckers are like little pieces of heaven. My husband and I could not get enough. Sweet and spicy and smoky. I now serve my attempt at them at every family gathering, I think they are making my mother in law start to hate me a little less, so special thanks for that Tuck. nWe also had the cheese curds, another first, and they were good. And we split the rib dinner. Those ribs, oh boy, the meat just melted off of the bone in the absolute best way possible. My husband was none too impressed by the cole slaw, but its hard for any cole slaw to stand out in a meal like that. nMy only gripe, like some of the other reviewers, is the price to portion ratio. We only had four of those mind blowing dates, which would be fine, if the price was better proportioned to the size. I felt a tad bit taken on the ribs also, again small portion for the price. This is the only reason I haven't been able to talk the hubby into another visit as of yet.",2
Everyone should try this place. One of the best late night dessert spots! Very affordable too.,2
"After all the hype about this place, I came there with high expectations. Boy I couldn't have been more disappointed. n nOur server was nice enough and very attentive, but when that is the best part of the experience, it's not good. My girlfriend and I both order various forms of their Bacon Cheeseburger. I ordered mine to be cooked medium and it came out well done. My girlfriend ordered her burger medium well and it came out medium rare. I decided to just go ahead and eat my burger, while she decided to send it back and have it cooked longer. n nThe amount of grease that was dripping off both our burgers was too much for us. We both ended up eating almost half of our burgers out of pure hunger more than anything else. I was really shocked at the quality of burger from a ""burger bar "". The fries were decent. n nThe restaurant itself has a pretty cool look to it, but it is very loud, almost like you are in a school cafeteria. I'm not quite sure where all the hype comes from for this place? It comes off as a desperate attempt to be the cool local burger joint that everyone thinks is cool to say they go there. n nThere are numerous places, not only on East blvd, but in the greater Charlotte area that I would recommend to get a burger. n nMaybe it was just a one time bad experience, but like my rating says. ""eek! me thinks not. """,1
"I would have given this place 2 stars. but just readon. n nI wasn't concerned that my room smelt like smoke even though it was non smoking or that all the creepers were also staying there, but what I was concerned about was this. n nThe second and last night I was there, we ordered room service after getting back from the bars. This was a little after 3 a.m. Myself and a friend I was this ordered some omelets, and we were told that it would take 45 minutes max. I mean. how long does it take to make and deliver an omelet? An hour goes by so we call and see where the food is at and they said 5 minutes ""we are busy "". Ok cool. 45 more minutes go by and. no food. We call again. I should be on its way. Well the food finally shows up at 5 30 am. The food is cold, omelets looks inedible, and the server doesn't have change for 100. We call room service and tell them this and how we waited for 2.5 hours and that if we knew we would have to wait this long. we would have went and got it ourselves. They told us to pay 50 of the bill. The guy comes back at 6 30am with the change as we were struggling to stay awake. n nAll in all, you get what you pay for and I'll never stay at the Imperial Palace. Save yourselves the trouble if you stay there and DONT ORDER ROOM SERVICE. n nI guess the one pro is that it has a good location on the strip. n nOh and this is not a place for children.",1
"Me and my dad have become regulars at this place. The atmosphere is always great and we are never disappointed with the food or service. We go to trivia night on wednesday nights and always have a blast good food, drinks and people. I'd recommend this place to anyone!",2
"Despite other reviews, we've gone here and never had a bad experience. They always get us in and out in under an hour. The staff is friendly and caring. The doctors are very skilled. They've treated my son and I for a variety of things during times our regular doctors couldn't see us.",2
Love this place! The garlic shrimp arepa and fried plantains are sooo good! The ribeye steak was a very generous portion for the price! n nWill definitely be back soon and recommend it to my friends!,2
"We've stayed here for the last couple CES conventions. The previous visit was definitely more enjoyable. During my most recent visit, the room 14th floor, not facing the pool was very noisy due to the ventilation system or something directly below. Also, the casino was extremely smokey, which is strange since this is technically a newer casino I didn't recall it being that bad previously. Other than that, I'd place South Point as about a 3.5 star hotel or a 4 star rapidly trending down . The rooms are great sized for the costs, but getting a bit worn. And the restaurants are all good. It would be nice if they had a more late night dining options.",1
"Why 5 stars? n nPrice to quality of the food ratio is excellent Don't expect to die of food joy, but you will come away happy and your wallet will still have some money in it. n nService is uniformly both friendly and accurate, without being overly attentive and hovering. n nThe ""YEAH TEXAS "" theme is a bit much, but what can you expect with the name? n nThe only thing that I totally HATE about the restaurant is the country music. I've been told that it's corporate policy to pipe that stuff in. If you ask, however, they will turn it down to a more ignore able level.",2
"Amazing seafood. n nThey have a bunch of different cuts of fresh fish out on display, which I personally love to see in a restaurant. The food is great and the atmosphere is great, although it can be a bit pricey. I only took one star off because service was slow, but I also went during peak dinner hours so that's excusable in my opinion.",2
"Let me start by saying that I have never written a review for any hospital ever. As a former Critical Care nurse I take patient treatment very seriously. Yesterday afternoon I had an unfortunate accident of falling off of a 3 foot high solid wood bar stool while hanging a photo I fell flat on my back onto the solid wood pottery barn stool breaking the stool into several pieces. Immediately my right arm and leg went numb and tingly and the pain was the worst excrutiating radiating pain I have experienced. I was shreiking at the top of my lungs from the pain. Luckily my husband was in the room and saw it happen. He lay me flat on the floor and because of the pain we thought I had definitely broken my back. I have never called 911 or had the opportunity for ambulance transport in my life. The Gilbert paramedics from Germann Lindsey were exceptional. They started an IV controlled my pain and looked at my back. They asked where I wanted to go and I hadn't hear any reviews regarding GMMC but it was the closest ER. The worst care ever hands down in my life. Chris RN seemed distracted and completely put out that i was there. Even after pain med from the paramedics my pain continued to be excrutiating. Dr. Nolan triage MD came in touched my toes and left. Never looked at my back, hip, etc. She slightly pressed on my abdomen and said xray ct and left. I told Chris RN my pain was over a 10 and he came back in 15 minutes later with Toradol basically Motrin . This didn't help even a little. As I cried in intense pain over the next 30 minutes my husband got Chris's attention and asked him to help. He said Dr. Nolan was the triage doctor and he would get another Dr. to ask for pain med. A gentleman with red hair and a badge that said Contractor came in and asked me a few questions. My husband had to leave while we waited for the CT to go home and check on our children we have a special needs son . While he was gone as I lay in excrutiating pain I got to listen to the nurses station party it up. Wes watched and listened to the preakness from his computer at the station, he was actually watching tv with an ER full of patients. He went on and on about who won what. Also, one of the ER techs was talking about ""cabeza de chorlito "". I guess he didn't think I spoke spanish, it means scatterbrain. Dr. Barrell the new physician RN Chris called, came in and touched my toes and again never looked at my back or hip, however, I was allowed 6mg of Morphine for pain. I couldn't get Chris's attention and so a female nurse put me on a bedpan where I sat for 20 mins until I slipped it out myself and it sat on the end of the gurney. My husband returned and I mentioned to him just how awful it was while he was gone. Thank heavens the xray and CT were negative for a break. I left immediately after the results as the care was so bad. I shuffled over to the bathroom with the help of my husband and Chris my nurse didn't even know. Dr. Barrell came in and told me their was about 10 min of paperwork to do and what pain med did I usually take I don't take pain med regularly and didn't really understand his question . I said whatever he though would stop the back spasms. I left with instructions for ice and hydrocodone . My IV was empty backing up with blood into the tubing and my nurse checked on my maybe twice in 3 1 2 hrs. Not one person looked at my back or hip while I was there. How can they even evaluate my accident? I woke up this morning with a huge hematoma about the size of an orange on my lower right back, a fist sized hematoma on my hip and a 5 inch bruise on my left buttock. The pain is very bad still today. It just occurred to me as I spoke to a nurse friend of mine that the ER people must have thought i was a ""drug seeker. "" I can't imagine why else they would have treated my so rudely. Never listened to my heart, lungs, or the part of my body that was hurt. I will never, ever return here for any care and would recommend that others drive a few minutes further for quality care. I haven't been out of nursing that long but I could have gone to the grocery store and received a better workup.",1
"The food is really good. My favorite dishes are the stuffed chicken wings, pat Thai, and basil chicken. I go to this place often since I live close and never had a bad experience with the food. The prices are right around 10 12 a plate. Service is not always the nicest, not rude, just not very nice. You get the feeling you're always bothering them. I don't care though, cause that's not my problem, so I just enjoy the food. Enjoy!",2
"Went here for lunch with a coworker. Got the chicken and mozarella salad. VERY tasty, but small portion. They give you a roll in a bag, which was odd. 23 for 2 salads, so a little steep.",2
"By far the worse place I have ever gotten my nails done at! I went here with my sister in law, and sister my manicure was horrible I asked for purple nails with white tips it looked as if a 8 year old had done my tips very crooked and my sister in laws nails never dried we got home and they were still wet 5 hours later as if the nail polish they used was sticky and not any good. Beyond disappointed with the job they did. They rush through the whole process and don't even check your nails to make sure they are dry. I'M WARNING YOU DONT GO TO THIS PLACE!",1

"That's one more cheap Thai place off my checklist. n nMy friend invited me out here for dinner. Don't get lost looking for this place like I did. It's around the corner at the edge of that really long strip mall with places like Pho Kim Long and Lee's Sandwiches, and the signs merely say ""Noodle House. "" n nThere isn't anything truly spectacular about the decor or ambiance, but I had absolutely no issues with it unlike some reviewers whose words I just read. You can see photos of the interior of this particular location on their web site. n nI mostly deferred to my friend's recommendations. We ended up sharing three dishes. n nRoasted duck curry 8.25 this was supposed to be duck fried rice, but we ended up with this instead due to some sort of miscommunication. Ordered as a spicy level of 3 out of 10 , which ended up not being bad at all for me. Decent amounts of duck, sweetness bolstered by the pineapple chunks. I've decided that I'm not a fan of this level of sweetness, but nothing wrong with this dish. n nYellow curry with chicken 6.95 spicy level of 5, but actually not an issue with my normally sensitive palate either. Potatoes were better than I've experienced in other yellow curries. Well executed overall, and my personal favorite of the night. n nRad na with beef 7.25 actually the first time I've tried this. Enjoyed the savory gravy quite a bit. Flat noodles, Chinese broccoli, and beef were all delicious as well. Glad I listened to my friend instead of defaulting to pad see eu. n nOverall impressions good portion sizes for the price, not as spicy as other Thai restaurants. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying that duck fried rice.",2
"Barrio is known for overpriced food and drinks. I have used to go to the original Barrio location a lot and watch the prices rise big time over the years. 11 for a dessert.

"An absolute gem of a park. At this point, I've been to 19 of the 30 MLB stadiums and this is tops for the ""new "" parks. It's hard to compare this to, say, Wrigley or Fenway simply because of their legitimate old school authenticity. PNC Park is one of the few retro stadiums that can actually hold a candle to the aforementioned parks. n nThe setting across the river from downtown makes for some amazing photos and views if your'e sitting most anywhere but the outfield. Closing down the bridge on game day to vehicle traffic is such a nice touch too. We were here on a Fri Sat evening pair of games against the Padres. Both were sold out, with the final one finishing off with fireworks and a concert. Never have I seen so many people stick around for such a terrible game Pirates lost handily . All this place does is promote the atmosphere of what's happening on the field even if that isn't all that great of a product . Someday, the Pirates will field a winning ballclub I KNOW IT! and this majestic stadium will be on prime display for the rest of the country to see. Until then, try and visit as soon as possible. You won't be disappointed.",2

"Went here with friends at 1030 p.m. following the marathon and amazed that they let my husband in while wearing his running attire as this is truly fine dining and he looked extraordinarily out of place. After losing an undisclosed amount of money, I wasn't really in the mood to eat yet another expensive meal however. n nI was prepared for high prices and adequate food but my oh my was I in for a pleasant surprise. at least on 50 of the expectations. Food Fabulous and Prices were indeed expensive but I have to say worth the full experience. n nMy husband shared the Chateaubriand Carved Tableside for Two, Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes for 110 Same as the Filet however, it comes with sides and costs less. It was prepared PERFECTLY and was delicious from the first bite to the last bite. n nOther sides folks had and loved were New Orleans Creamed Spinach Twice Baked Potato with Bacon and Vermont Cheddar nThe wine we chose we asked for a med full bodied red with a smooth finish and complex aromas that didn't cost more than 100 or 1000 see photo of wine prices He actually suggested something for around 60 or so and it was exquisite! nChappellet Mountain Cuvee 2009. n nAdd this to your to do list in Vegas and go hungry!

"I went here after reading the reviews on Yelp, they took my insurance and I could walk from my house! I was greeted by Brittany the receptionist who is fabulous she gave me a tour of the building explained there was a little area for me to use the computer to check email or use the phone if I needed to, showed my the waiting area with complimentary water and a TV to watch whatever I want and where the exam rooms were and the rest rooms I was made to feel very welcome. Only after I had been show everything and made comfortable was I given any paperwork to fill out since it was my first visit normally, when you arrive the first thing they do is ask for your insurance card not here and I must say, a very nice touch ! n nChelsea, the hygenist, came to get me next, once i was done with the paperwork and walked me through everything she was going to do in easy speak as well as finding out a little bit about me. I was having x rays first and she was really gentle and encouraging . When she left to go and develop and scan the x rays, I was given the remote to the TV above my head and left to watch whatever I wanted. n nThe cleaning was painless no hard scraping or poking and she explained what all the numbers were that she was taking notes of regarding my gums. n nDr Tran is charming again she explained everything and took pictures of what needed to be done so she could explain to me easily. n nAll in all a simple and painless experience and I would recommend Simply Dentistry to anyone the inside is beautiful, spa like and they treat you like a special human being !",2

"I was craving korean bbq one night and decided I'd eat somewhere I've never been before, so I ended up at this place. I ordered a combo that came with some spicy tofu soup and a few pieces of short ribs for 18. The tofu soup honestly tasted like mildly spicy water, there was hardly any flavor. The short ribs were somewhat good. The whole time while I was eating, nobody came to my assistance asking if I needed anything else. Minutes later a young lady came and asked me to pay even when I wasn't even done with my food I found this kind of rude . I told her I wanted to order something else because I was still kind of hungry, so I went and ordered some beef cubes which came out to be 28 Pretty pricey for a plate with a few pieces of meat . She still insisted me on paying for my first meal and then pay for the other stuff later. The beef came out to be a little over cooked, there was no juiciness to it. The whole entire time, still, no one came to ask me if everything was okay. I wasn't too satisfied with the customer service. All in all, I could've gotten all you can eat korean bbq over at Korean Garden, Tofu Hut, or Sura for way less with better service. Don't think I'll be coming back.",1
Reasonable Mexican food at rock bottom prices. Great cocktails too. I went with a large group of people on a hot day and it was a little uncomfortable in the small dining area most people had to go outside at some point for air. Other than that we all had a nice meal and were impressed by the service.,2
Everything is 100 fresh and organic. This is an amazing venue and it is open everyday!,2
"Noticed this place when in the area for gelato and fish tacos, but reviews made it sound pretty dismal. I'm not really an AYCE sushi person, and not having a website listed or menu in the photos made me hesitant to visit. nHesitation wasn't unwarranted, it turned out. n nWent in to order takeout. Opted for the rolly roll and the pink lady roll. nSat at the sushi bar next to an AYCE patron. As I waited, he ordered and received 3 different rolls. This began to get annoying as I waited nearly 20 minutes for my order restaurant wasn't busy, only two other tables were in and neither was actively ordering. One other person was waiting on a takeout order and waited longer than I did. nWhat really irritated me was realizing that my order sat at the counter for a good 10 minutes before the older waitress noticed and brought it to me. nAnd then I had to remind her to charge my card before I left. Service, needless to say, is lacking. n nFood was okay. nRolly roll was one of those rounded mounds of mixed rice and fish I'm not a huge fan of that type of ""roll "" and though there was nothing wrong with the flavor, I was annoyed that the nontraditional roll structure was not mentioned on the menu when I ordered. nPink lady roll was just okay sauce did not taste like any garlic ponzu I've had and the salmon almost tasted cooked rather than fresh. Disappointing.",1
"This is my new favorite shop by far! Huge selection of quality clones, and a good number of authentics, Not overly pricey, and a generally cool ambience. Taylor was a cool guy, and on subsequent returns the other guys working there proved to be equally knowledgable and friendly. Juice selection was great because they have stuff you don't see in other shops, like bamskillicious, and Dr. Mike's. Very good experience each time i have been there and would recommend this place to anybody who vapes. Possibly not the best for the brand newbie, someone who has never vaped before at all, but definitely intermediate to advanced. Very awesome shop, worth the drive from wherever you are coming in the valley.",2
My favorite suntofu place! I always recommand this place to my friends when they want to eat korean food.,2

"We were so excited to try this addition to Legume out. We arrived around 7pm, sat down, ordered drinks, and inquired about food desserts.

"I would say the 3 stars is representative of how the restaurant's food is but for some reason our service was terrible. n nThere's a to go window right next door for those who don't want to wait 15 20 min. I came by for lunch on a Saturday at around noon, and placed an order of the beef Thai salad at the to go window since we were hungry and wanted something to eat while we waited. n nOnce we got inside, for some reason it took forever to flag down a waitress. When we ordered orange smoothie, ABC burger and pizza with onions and spinach , she came back 5 minutes later asking me to repeat my order, and if I wanted it for here or to go. What the hell is that supposed to mean? If I'm dining inside the restaurant, why would I want it to go? n nWhen the food finally arrived, the order was wrong they gave us pizza with mushrooms and spinach, and the burger came with a side of french fries which I didn't want the waitress never asked us for our preference on the side.

"As a Taiwanese native who came from Taiwan years ago, i think this place has a mediocre taste. The food looks good, the service wasn't bad, but the food doesn't have much flavor. My wife and I ordered Fried chicken with rice and ""rou wan "" . The ""rou wan "" only has a little bit of meat which is a bit of a rip off and the fried chicken was just an ok. The overall experience was a 2 out of 5. This place is not bad, but I wouldn't say it is outstanding. nAlso noticed that this place was also called Taiwan Deli on yelp!",1
Good burgers but even greater fries and sauces. I didn't like the chicken burger but farm burger and the hog burger ?

"Just wanted to write a review to chip in with what the others said. I would not recommend going. If you have little kids under 8 maybe , they might like it but unless you have a lot of money to waste it probably wouldn't be worth finding out. A lot of the attractions are not very accurate. There's one where you strike a pose and you summon a superhero based on your pose. 8 out of 10 people would change their pose and summon the same superhero. Also, there's nowhere to sit. You wait in line after line and nowhere to sit. By the end, we were excited for the sitting ride. That actually was a cool part really, the only cool part. Yeah, just thinking about it now depresses me a bit. I would gladly have the memories erased from my brain if I could have the money back.",1

"Although I'm a woman and this is a men's store, I've been in there several times with my partner. He's a tall and skinny guy and clothes never seem to fit him right. This store has sizes perfect for him. You can not only find the obscure ones but they will also order things for you. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. I only find it strange that they have three people working in such a small space but they obviously all like their jobs and are very pleasant, no ""above you "" attitude. They do, as someone else said, have sales once and awhile. Today we went our third time or so there and they had a sale where most things were 50 off. Even though the dressier jean trousers were about 160 with the sale, they are truly worth it. The fit is amazing, the fabric is great, they are made in the USA. Great little store, and we will continue to do our once or twice a year shopping there.",2
"It's just ok. At first, the food tasted pretty good, but as we settled into the meal we found it to be quite greasy. In fact, my wife got sick from the meal while I only had an upset stomach. I think we'll have to find another place.",1
"Went in with a group that paid for bottle service, I am the lone black dude in our crew, about 4 I went back to our table which was vacant the time most of the crew had left . Manager comes up and tells me the table is reserved and proceeds to kick me out for sitting my table! n nI'm a 15 year clubbing veteran and this was the first time I'd ever been kicked out. n nFirst time for everything I guess.

Staff is very friendly and always glad to see you!,2
"50 minute delivery sweet. Order arrived correct sweet. Sauce spilled in bag everywhere, not sweet. Pizza toppings all tossed in the middle. Half my pizza has no toppings just cheese. Serious? Fries soggy as hell serious? Driver disappeared right after cash gone. Never restated order , confirming nothing. Give me money gone. No have a nice night, just in out gone. I appreciate the food from here when done right, but tonight it was done disastrously. We tossed it out and hit 7 11.",1

Best Taiwanese restaurant so far since I came to the states!,2
"If you are female I would not recommend this place! Stay away service contracts etc added in after being shuffled through 5 salesmen! Really it is the epitome of the ""old car "" sales place!

I found this spot on yelp. Me and my wife went there for breakfast. I couldn't believe how busy they were. It lived up to the 5 star reviews. Met and talked to the owner very nice guy . Crepes are incredible. A little bit of a drive but well worth it. Will be back.,2
"I don't need to sing the praises of The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. This working scientific research station has been adding value to Edinburgh and scientific understanding of plants and fungi since the seventeenth century. n nIn the past 30 odd years, the RBG has reached out into the community, engaging folk in all parts of Scotland and around the world in the enterprise of discovery. n nThe new kid on this established block is the John Hope Gateway at what used to be the 'back entrance' to the Garden on Arboretum Place. In the John Hope Gateway you'd find the RGB's new biodiversity and information centres and a simply excellent place to go for breakfast, lunch or afternoon tea. n nThe Librarian and I took the train from Glasgow, made our way across Princes Street to Hanover Street. We walked down Dundas Street and onto Inverleith Row by way of Brandon Street. Through the Garden we reached the back door now guarded by the very welcoming Gateway. n nWe had booked and were seated whenever we arrived. The menu was proffered and we looked over the balcony to the madding crowd below. We selected crab salad and duck boring, I know, but we both had the same. n nThe food was nicely prepared and well presented, although the crab salad gave the impression of being a little 'tired'. Perhaps they were saving money by preparing the little salad starters early and having them sit about waiting to be ordered? n nI noted that HMQ had been to the Garden formally to open the new gateway. She will have been impressed by everything that she saw. n nI cannot think of another scientific research institute in the UK that is as open to the public nor as responsive to public interest. The addition of the Gateway is icing on an already very nice cake, and the inclusion of this restaurant is inspired.",2

They are very profeesional and a great company! n n nLOVE LOVE LOVE DOLCE!",2
"Once again US AIRWAYS has proven itself to be one of the worst air carriers that I have ever had the unfortunate pleasure to fly with. Not only did the ticketing agent take my properly stored ammunition, stored in accordance with TSA guidelines, but then began the process of denying me my flight because I said I was going to file a complaint. The ""Supervisor "" was very belligerent when i asked who i talk to in order to get reimbursed. When I challenged him regarding something I had said he replied ""Are you saying the I'm lying?! "" Yes ""You're telling me that a 60year old man is lying?! "" Yes. This is not the first time US AIRWAYS has made my travel a living hell but it will certainly be my last.",1
"This is a NOISY, DIRTY UN FRIENDLY store! Sure it has all the same items every other Dollar Tree has, but the ""cheap "" isn't worth it!

"Came here for Sunday brunch. It's a nice restaurant, and we were able to actually sit outside while we ate. The food was very good, if somewhat on the small portion size. I had the croque and my husband had the crab oscar benedict. Wish we had the chance to come here for dinner.",2
"This place came recommended by many as the buffet with the best value food cost wise. 25 bucks for dinner on the weekday. For my first round, I got the beef roast from the carving station, shrimps, crab legs, fish cod and bass , sweet potato fries, and a salmon skin roll. The beef was delicious but a bit over processed or too tenderized. And you can't really choose how much it's cooked. They just slice you off a piece. And I love sweet potato fried but these were just ok. The crab was too salty for me. Next I got a bowl of pho and wonton noodle soup from the noodles station as well as some porridge congee from the Asian station. Yeah I know I'm very Asian. They were piping hot and so tasty. The bowls are weird though so you can't put too much in there without it spilling. I couldn't eat too much after that so I went to the desserts, getting some fruit and gelato. I love that they have their own display case of gelato about 8 different flavors worth. There's so many other stations too pizza Italian, Mexican, seafood, Asian, carving, salad, cold foods, noodle, and desserts. Something for everyone. n nI also came here for champagne brunch a couple years ago and it was amazing. We stayed for hours, enjoying the food and out mimosas. Also a good price for good food.",2
"Their Chicago style pizza is delicious with chunks of seasoned tomatoes and gooey cheese nestled inside. Their other pizzas are quite tasty as well. Delivery is quick and easy. I can't speak to the authenticity of their Chicago pizzas, but I'll be returning many a time to Little Chicago's.",2
"I have not even set foot in the store and I never will. n nI flew down to Arizona a few weeks ago to visit my really good friend Dani. She'd just gotten engaged, so we made an appointment to go look at dresses. I called to set it up, and the lady didn't even ask my name or anything. Then I realized I'd forgotten if she said 1 30 or 11 30. So I called back. They had no record of me. I rescheduled for 1 30 on a Saturday. STILL DIDN'T ASK FOR A NAME! Again it was a very short conversation. n nThe bride and I were kind of put off. Then we emailed them, hoping to get someone who wasn't the receptionist. NEVER HEARD BACK. We emailed 2 days after our ""appointment "" and said we didn't feel like calling to cancel because they couldn't even respond to us, or care who we were! n nNo response! n nNot even an apology or a manager stepping in. We found a few other places around to browse, but it really killed our buzz. Needless to say she won't buy from there, and I'm never traveling for them again!",1
We went there last night because we heard of the all you can eat crab legs. The crab legs had no flavor at all. None of us liked any of the food there. We wrong be back. On a side note they were very friendly.,1
"They gave their coffee away for free for a few weeks as a promo. There was this this tall guy that went in like every day and only got the free stuff.and never went back. I don't think he even tipped. Now they are out of business and i ""m pretty sure it's entirely his fault.",1
Great breakfast burros and hot sauce. Will be back very soon to try the rest.,2
"I came here for Sunday lunch with my roomie back when I lived in the city. They were running a BOGO special last summer, which led us to try the place. I'm a huge fan of spicy dishes, so I went for the Indonesian Peanut Saute Noodles with the Thai Curry Soup. The soup was nothing special, just a simple, spicy broth with some fresh veggies thrown into it. I did enjoy my Indonesian Peanut Saute. I wouldn't exactly classify this meal as authentic Asian by any means, but it tastes great from an Americanized point of view. The portions here lean on the larger side, so come here hungry!",2
"I had heard about this place from a few people.all who loved it. I didn't want to review it after my first dinner there because I was sure it was a fluke. After the second visit I realized there wouldn't be a third visit. n nThe first time they were short handed in the kitchen. The food took a long time. But it was good, the risotto fantastic. Also, the service was okay.nothing spectacular but not the worst I've had. n nThe second time they were short handed in the front of house. The service was appalling. My water only refilled once.we could never catch our server to get another glass of wine. Only 1 employee.a busboy.showed any desire to be at work. At one point the hostess was chatting with the people at the next table and then showed off her newest tattoo on the shoulder blade. The food was mediocre. Oh and the fabulous risotto? It is only offered with the special. n nOh and don't plan on spending less than 2.5 hours for dinner with no dessert.",1
"This is an amazing museum! It is so large though so you will get tired. Since I can't offer any other display information that the other reviewers have not already told you I will give you some advice on your visit. Wear your walking shoes. Honestly, I can't even imagine bringing kids here since I spent 7 hours and still missed things. I was beat afterwards. n I loved my visit here.I especially loved the Artist Room with John Lennon and Paul Simon on display. Heaven for me The traveling Latino display with the NYC Juke box listening booths and Interactive displays were so much fun. You can remix songs and play the piano keys back to some cool songs. i just could not get the 5th song right on the playback the tune display. I trilled those keys for like 15 minutes. I was so stubborn and finally played the right notes. After you get it right the screen tells you the name of the song. I felt like an accomplished musician after I finally go it right! lol. I also liked the big wooden dance floor and dance video exhibit in the same room. n The negative of MIM is the expense. It is obvious you need more than one trip here to see everything and the price might inhibit that. 15 dollars. I was able to get in free since it was teacher month. However, I am sad to think I won't be able to go back since it is also a far away drive. They don't offer coupons either according to the staff and from anywhere that I have ever found. and I am good at scoping out those types of things n If you do get a chance to go THEN GO and RUN THERE! You will love it if you love music. if you are a teacher you have to go now since you only have one more week to take advantage of their free admission. And as the intro video pointed out. n n ""Without music the language of our souls would die. "" So true! Enjoy your visit!",2

"Korean BBQ Warning while attending and eating Korean BBQ please dress appropriately! After effects may include full belly, the need to use a toothpick, flush face especially when you're Asian , and YOU SMELL LIKE YOU JUST ATE SOME KOREAN BBQ comments! n nI should have known, but I enjoy putting on a nice blazer that now needs to go to the cleaners. n nMoving on, Korean BBQ is a small mom pop shop. The name of the restaurant got to the point and no beating around the bushes here. You get what you order. Grill your beef strips and pork fat yourself! Hmm ain't nothin' like some pork fat over some Hite OB beer Soju doesn't hurt either, but make sure you can handle yourself after a few rounds. Overall, the food was pretty good and authentic here. Service was lovely and our waitress started the grilling for me and showed me the tools and tricks. Yes, my friends I'm not much of a cook even in front of a grill. n nAs I said early Korean BBQ is a small shop with some basic decor. They have a full bar, but I didn't take advantage of it since I was busy trying to grill haha! They seem to have a karaoke room that was empty. Not sure if they have karaoke nights, but let me know and I'll bust out my Bruno Mars impression! Enjoy!",2
very nice spot right off s blvd in charlotte. astmosphere is laid back and they have a live band at times which makes the experience that much more pleasureable. as for the food.excellent! i would recommend to everyone,2
I've been for lunch three times. We had fabulous food every time. Menu selection is very original. Prime rib sandwich is the best I've ever had. The wait staff is efficient but kinda dry. Overall this one is a keeper.,2
"So the coleslaw wasn't for me. but then again I just remembered I don't like coleslaw no matter how good it is!

Linens at a bar?!.oh yeah! n nI can see my food being made and could tell kitchen was clean. I was impressed. Total 180 degrees from a year ago.

"Boy, this place went downhill fast. Did they change owners, cooks food suppliers. Food is gritty, sauces are thick and or slimy and the chicken is not cooked all the way. What a shame. Won't be back, until things improve.",1
"Wouldn't recommend this company for a Segway tour. They appeared to be rushed, not very knowledgeable of downtown and the areas that were toured were uninteresting.",1
"Older casino on the strip. If you are going to the strip, you should hit the big flashier casino to get the full Vegas experience. But if you are going for a smaller laid back feel, you might as well hit one of the local Station casinos or The Orleans. Cleaner and more up to date. This casino definitely looks like old school 'has been'. It needs some serious updating.",1
"RUDE AND INCOMPETENT SECURITY OUTDATED ROOM POOR MANAGEMENT n nThis is a one star coming from a person who couldn't care less when it comes to hotel rooms. I've stayed at the Motel 6 and was even fine with it, so to say that my experience at Motel 6 TRUMPS my experience at the Caesars Palace really means something. n n1. Outdated rooms. Step up your game, Caesars. Even Circus Circus has all their rooms fully renovated. n n2. All our room keys suddenly stopped working the second night even though we had the room checked out for three nights. What? We were extremely tired and all we wanted to do was come back for some rest, but were locked out and had to inconveniently go downstairs to be issued new keys. n n3. After working in customer service for more than seven years, I have a lot of empathy for the people who work behind the counter. I understand there are some bad days and some customers just ask for it, but what I got from the incompetent security guard was unacceptable and uncalled for. All I wanted to do was to pick up a binder that was left behind by my friend who had the room checked out to her. My friend spoke to the hotel manager about the situation prior to my arrival and he told her to let me know the procedure Go to security get housekeeping involved get the binder. n nThis security guard made my life so much harder by playing games, asking who specifically stayed in the room even when I gave him the name of who the room was checked out to, saying the room wasn't checked out to her even though it WAS, playing with the pronunciation of names, making me walk all the way to the front desk even though he knew the power was in his hands to just call housekeeping up for the item, making up ""issues "" even though the hotel manager clearly said THOSE WEREN'T ISSUES to begin with. n nBasically, this guy just wanted to come off as if he knew everything and made up his own procedures to kill his boredom. I ultimately got the item after more than an hour of dealing with his incompetence and his need to go on a power trip. n n4. No apology from the hotel manager even though he knew exactly what the dbag security guard was doing. n nTo top it all off, this whole security fiasco made it a sour start to my birthday. I recommend this place to no one.",1

He also found a piece of lettuce from the dishwasher I guess in his glass of water.serious? nI sent back my Cajun Chicken that tasted like it was rolled in the Dead Sea it was disgustingly salty. nSimply put, they take no care in the food they serve and it's totally bad. Our waitress tried hard to keep us happy we are not complicated guys but the food was horrible. nThis place needs Gordon Ramsey to show them how to cook.",1
Not a good meal. Meatballs and chickpea crepes were too salty. Eggplant and spinach was an unappetizing greasy pile of slime and tasted oily. The meatballs were accompanied by truly tasteless tomato sauce. The pasta was nothing special. Crispy Brussels sprouts were anything but.undercooked and chewy. And three slices of bread was brought to the table with just enough olive oil for two slices.,1

"I was driving down Buffalo and came across this place. Boy am I glad I stopped by. n nOMG! This place is the bomb diggity! Never expected the food to be so delicious! It's like an explosion of flavors in your mouth! The red velvet pancake is to die for. n nI'm from Hawaii so it was a surprise to see Hawaiian dishes served here.

They filled our drinks when needed and provided a smile every time they came by. n nI know this is random but their water was so good! Very Cold and tasted fresh! That is also a plus for me when checking out a new restaurant as you know you don't always want to get drinks. So rest assured if you want water here your gonna have a good one. n nPrice is very reasonable for the taste your are going to receive. The portions are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go! n nI had a great overall experience as a first timer.

"Don't eat here. Just drink here. On second thought, maybe don't even drink here. nFor breakfast, I had a lapful of mimosas and somebody else's food. In their defense, they did comp us the first round of drinks, and we did get free cotton candy. I dunno, I'm just not impressed.",1
"I had some issues with my tires and I found this place and made an appointment online very convenient . Within a day, Howard Jr. emailed me back and helped set up an appointment promptly. I went to the shop very clean and neat to have them look at my tire issues and also change the oil. My low profile tires needed to be ordered from another shop which I was told would take about an hour or so. So one of the employees a very nice gentleman training to be the manager of their new location in South Phoenix offered to drive me home allowing me to get some work done. An hour later, the shop called with my new tires and the same gentleman came to pick me up again. So easy! n nNow, my car is old so it needs a little help, but my biggest fear in mechanics is that they'll find so much wrong and they'll condemn my car to certain death. So I knew that in the oil change process, the mechanics would find some things that needed work. They found a few concerns, but Howard explained to me what was needed without trying to scare me into forking over loads of money for these repairs. I had been quoted these repairs at different shops as well but for twice what Community Tires Pros would charge me. The whole process was super easy and everyone was patient and answered all my questions. When I do have some more money to start on the list of repairs on my car, I will be taking it back to Community Tire Pros. Oh, and today I received a delightful thank you card in the mail. The actual mail, not email. Wonderful!",2
"Totally mismanaged. Showed up on the night of Valentine's Day at 8 00 and was told they were not taking anymore reservations and no longer had availability for walk ins. The line going to the entrance was pretty long. I went onto my iPhone and used OpenTable to make a reservation for 8 30. I came back at 8 30 and they made us wait until nearly 9 00. By that time, they were chasing others away. When we were finally seated, we realized the place was dead. I couldn't believe all of the open tables. Then I thought that maybe they were just understaffed. That wasn't the case either. Our waiter came over to us and just stared at us as if he was expecting us to ask a question. Maybe he was mentally trying to ask if we wanted something. I mentally tried telling him to F Off and I think he heard me. I felt bad for those people who were told they were sold out. They were lied to. It's a shame because the Memphis All Stars were actually a really good band. Only in Vegas can you have a wedding reception at BB Kings and have the Memphis All Stars as your wedding band. To the management sorry guys, it's BB Kings, not Studio 54.",1
"Amazing service. Really. I've never heard of this burger chain, but hadn't eaten in 12 hours and 12 states. I just wanted a burger. The menu was a befuddlement of strange ways to make a burger. I picked a Cali burger but without the house sauce careful due to egg allergy . It tasted weird, really.weird. The tomato was a glop fire roasted apparently and the onions were more like egg noodles wet cooked strings. nI scraped it off and tried again but it still tasted weird. Megan, my attentive waitress, asked if everything was good. I expressed my opinion. Although I didn't like it I didn't blame the restaurant. Sometimes things just aren't to your taste. However my surprise and delight the manager immediately swooped in, organized for me as close to a ""regular "" burger as they were able to construct which was basically burger, bun, lettuce, raw onions. The manager also brought over a selection of sauces on the side. She asked if I like mustard. I said don't even go there I only like colemans. 3 minutes later she showed up with a side dish of English mustard! The new burger was much more to my liking. n nSo there you go it's not my kind of restaurant but that's no ones fault. This place went above and beyond to make it as right as they possibly could. Epically amazing service.",2
"I visited Pho Saigon 8 just this past week because of it's ratings on Yelp. What a major disappointment. This restaurant doesn't even compare to the Vietnamese places I've frequented in San Jose, or my more recent home in Santa Rosa. The broth for their Pho is watered down and really pretty tasteless. So sadly, I will never visit this restaurant again. I'll look for another place the next time I visit Las Vegas. I can't believe this place gets such a high rating. I guess taste buds dry up in the desert.",1

"Absolutely THE best place to eat in the West Island. Mouthwatering salads, fabulous pizza, amazing grilled chicken pasta dishes. all made with the freshest local ingredients and served to you by friendly courteous staff. n nIn the summer, the terrace is an oasis nestled beneath a vine covered pergola where you can enjoy the waterfront ambiance while sipping Sangria and enjoying a leisurely meal. n nIf you have not tried this place yet, you're really missing out!",2
Worst Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had! Not sure if it's the seasoning on the beef or the beef but it has no flavor and very bland. Waste of 10! Won't be coming back.,1
Still one of my favorite buffets on the strip. Good variety of food and good quality. Be sure to get the 39.99 24hour deal.,2
This is the worst type of place! 1st of all it's in a strip mall so you know 6 months from now it will be a T Mobile. 2nd of all the staff is RUDE! I asked what kid if cheese they offered and they elderly lady behind the counter seemed very upset that I was even there ordering. The walls and floors were not clean my table needed to be wiped down and I had to ask twice before it was cleaned. It took forever to get my food and they were not that busy. Some old man and young guy were fighting so loud in the back room I could hear them at my table. They offer free refills on drinks but you have to go back to the counter to get it and they act mad that you want a refil. 3rd the food. Average at best. I was so hoping the burgers would be good. The bun was nice. But the lettuce was turing brown and the tomatoe was soggy. The patty itself was dry and over cooked. I also ordered zuchinni sticks and they were ok. They chop them long ways and bread them but one was not cooked all they way. Surprise needs a good burger joint and this is not it.,1
I love ra and have been here many times and many locations. This ra has the worst service of all! We had to ask for our server multiple times and usually do at this location. This was a Friday night and there were tons of open tables. The worst part is that they were out of fried ice cream. The whole reason we went to Ra instead of a different sushi place. The server did nothing. I am sorry but you shouldn't be out of your desserts on a Friday night and there's clearly something wrong with this location since it was empty on a Friday night and every other ra you go to is packed beyond belief. We will be going to the other locations from now on.,1
I buy about 3 or 4 pairs of j's a year just for hoopin. You can always find a pair for half the original price,2
"I wish I could give this salon a positive review. Davy o, the owner, is a very nice guy and was beyond accommodating during the time he spent doing my hair. He was super cool and puffed cigs and chatted me up while putting in my extensions. Thing is, you don't go to hair salons to hang out with your homies. Duh. n nThe thing is, Davy o uses low grade, loose hair for his keratin bonds, instead of using pre tipped hair. What does that mean on the ""user end ""? It means that your ratty extensions will almost completely disintegrate over the next month and you'll have to pay someone else who actually knows what they're doing to replace them. He also trims the hair before attaching it, in effort to make neat little bundles to dip in the keratin glue. This means if you bought 18 inches of hair, you'll end up with 16. n nThe final result was much thinner and shorter than I'd expected. I was so disappointed, I went and cried in the bathroom for a minute, before paying and going on my way. I'm getting them removed asap and will not be back to this salon.",1
Great service. Always fast and courteous.,2
"Both my boss and I really wanted to like Rigas Diner, but they make it so hard. It's right between work and home and it seems like it should be as good as it is convenient. It's just not. The first visit there they served raw fries coated in fryer grease. When we spoke up about it, the owner said ""well, it was taking too long to cook, so we just served it "". Maybe they thought we were to dumb to notice? If a Rigas Diner can't even get french fries right then you can probably imagine just how really bad the more complicated items are. Well, they are worse than that. nAfter that, I pretty much gave up on Rigas Diner. My boss still keeps trying to love that place even though every time he visits, he gets some kind of unearthly mockery of what he ordered. For example, he got an omelet one time, and for some reason they decided to put a half pound of canned Jalapenos on it. He showed me his meal take out and it was really funny just how ridiculous it was! nAnother time everything was raw. nI make fun of him for going to Rigas because he always gets awful food. He says the menu has the potential of being awesome, and he hopes that one day they figure out how to make what's on it. I think he might get really sick way before that ever happens. nAt least as I passed by today as I do every day I saw that it was totally empty in there. Friday night at dinner time is usually a busy time for any halfway decent eatery. I guess people have figured out that this place sucks.",1
"I feel very conflicted in writing this review, but I think it needs to be written. Our party arrived at 4 30pm in order to get a good view of the TVs for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals. n nThe good Food. Everything we ordered came out cooked well and tasted fantastic. The beer cheese? AMAZING. Pulled Pork? Fantastic. After ordering fries from the happy hour menu more on this later , it took about 20 minutes to get them. Our server gave us a second order at no charge. That's really where the ""good "" ends. n nThe bad They didn't have ANY drinks available for happy hour! What kind of bar, new or old, doesn't have drinks available for happy hour?! It's on the menu, but they ""haven't figured out the pricing for it yet. "" So you still pay Strip prices for alcohol. This was a huge disappointment that they hopefully fix very soon. n nThe UGLY After being there for a couple hours 3 periods, plus intermissions and OT , someone decided to change the channel in the middle of the OT period. We waited for about 2 minutes before we bailed on our check and ran down the way to Yard House who had the game on. We did come back to pay our check and watch the second OT period, but they had split up our table and didn't put the game back on the TV we had been watching. Our server apologized, but the only comment we received from management was ""you should've stayed. They got the game back on, "" met with a chuckle. As a Kings fan, during the eventual Cup winning game, I felt this was very rude and a little bit disrespectful. n nI won't trust Tilted Kilt LV to air any professional sport in its entirety from here out. I understand it could have been a freak incident, but to cause customers and fans to potentially miss the game winning goal and NOT APOLOGIZING is pathetic. They are lucky we were honest people that came back to pay the check. Get your issues hashed out and put booze on the happy hour menu and MAYBE I'll change my star rating. Until then, I won't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"For over a decade, Claim Jumper was one of my favorite family restaurants. Things changed when the Landry's corporation began taking over. Favorite dishes like the Whiskey Chicken, Gold Rush Chicken and others started disappearing. Prices slowly crept up. A favorite of mine, the salad bar, is now only available in a couple of locations. Then before you knew it, no more muffins with your entree. n nLandry's, thanks for ruining a good thing. I have to remind myself not to be tempted coming here based on memories of great past experiences.",1
"I would not recommend this restaurant. n nUpon arrival, sour puss, non smiling hostesses. If I were their manager, I would tell them to smile to each and every guest at a minimum. If not, just go home. n nWaitress was fine. Nothing to compliment or complain about. n nThe food. oh, the food. n nBland. Tasteless. Biscuits and gravy was like eating paste. yea, that kind you get in kindergarten. don't lie, we all tasted it once! It did have chunks of cold sausage in it though which was good. If cold sausage is your thing. n nHome fries were NOT home fries. They were grilled sliced potatoes. No seasoning or onions or peppers. n nNo free refills on iced coffee BTW, even though the waitress made it seem that there were. n nThe real kicker I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. They came out with a nice glaze over the top and hard as a rock poached eggs. the cook left it sitting in the heat lamp for too long which is any amount of time greater than .01 second . I sent it back to receive about .25 oz of smoked salmon and maybe 2 T of bland Hollandaise sauce. Not quite the 12 dish I was expecting. n nEverything else was boring too. n nBlueberry pancakes and coffee were very good. n nDefinitely NOT going to return. For the 60 it cost me to eat here, I could put out a killer spread and STILL have money left over to hit up Bergies for an outstanding ice coffee.",1
If you win you lost ! They wont pay your win ! Service is unnessecary because nobody cares and service buttons mostly doesnt work. staff is unfriendly and the old ladies who serve cocktails are just disgusting! Buuh.,1
"I am so disappointed in my treatment from the Luxor after reporting that I had items stolen from me. Here is a copy of the email I wrote to them at the beginning of September. I had to follow up myself, more than once, to see the outcome of my claim. Basically today I was told that after the ""internal investigation "" the woman Lisa in lost and found said she didn't steal my things. Again, it could have been anybody working in Lost and Found during those 4 days before it was sent back in the mail. My response to the man working on my case was "" no one is going to admit to stealing! "" Basically I got a ""sorry lady. "" He never said he interviewed anyone else either. I felt like my claim was just swept under the rug. The way the investigator treated me it was as if I was the one pulling a fast one! For a company this size compensation would have been nothing to them. Having to replace all the items I just bought cost me an extra 450. I am staying at this hotel in December for a bachelorette party, but after that I will never be back again! Shame on you for being so blase about this matter! You have thieves working for you! n nHere is the email nI am writing to you to bring to your attention theft of my belongings while they were in your care. I stayed at your hotel August 15th for one night, reservation was under Jayson Khademi and D'Lisa Ledgewood. When leaving in the morning I left my backpack on the bench at valet and once I realized this I called right away. Lisa at lost and found informed me she has my bag but since it didn't have any identification in it we went over what was inside. Right on top I had a gallon bag filled with skin care products, most of them were brand new because I purchased them right before my 2 week road trip. Lisa even joked that I had quite a bit of skin care items and I told her that I was a salon owner in Scottsdale and an Aesthetician so my skin has to look amazing. She told me how to go online to claim the bag and have it sent back to me. We were on our way to Sedona and the cabin we were going to be staying out didn't have internet. I told this to Lisa and informed her that I would fill out the necessary forms when I got home on Sunday. When I received my bag back 90 of my skin care items were not there. I am not in anyway accusing Lisa, I am sure there were many people working at that station from Thursday until the next Monday that could have had access to it. But because of the conversation I had with Lisa I know all my products were there when the bag was turned in. n nList of the missing items and their cost, all were Bioelements which are found exclusively in salons nMoisture Positive Cleanser 34 nAdvanced Vitamineral C Complex 50 nCreataFirm 62 nLightPlex 60 nSunscreen 42 nSleepwear 62 nLiLash 140 n nTotal cost of products stolen 450 n nI had to go an repurchase all of these items at a cost of 450. The way I see it my one day trip to your hotel cost me an extra 900! I have been staying at the Luxor for 19 years. I have always been satisfied with the service until now. It was bad enough thinking I lost my bag so imagine how happy I was to know that it was turned in with all my things still in it. Imagine how incredibly angry and disappointed I was when it was returned to me with so many items missing. I will not b returning to your hotel and I will be writing this on my review on Yelp. If we as guest can't trust your staff, who can we trust when at your hotel?",1
"What a cool place. If you don't know what Tapas are, it's basically small side dishes appetizers. This place has is down, you can order all sorts of Tapas until you are full. It's reasonable on price for what you get to try and everything tastes good. n nIt has a full bar and it's packed and popular with the young crowd. Great people watching for sure.",2
Saw the waffle ice cream cone on the window and rolled in on impulse. FAIR WARNING don't get it. It's like they poured a milk shake into a cone. Unhappy camper ,1
"If Walmart had existed in the 14th century, Dante Alighieri would almost certainly have used it as a template for one of the layers of hell. n nIf I were to grade Walmart based upon products carried and pricing it would probably be a solid 3 stars. One cannot, however, ignore the other pieces to this puzzle. n nThe lines Checking out always takes longer than the actual shopping. nThe people There are some skeevy people shopping at the 'Mart. nThe crushing sense of despair I feel it. n nThe unfortunate fact about Walmart is that there are times when my only viable option is to shop there, like when I need little propane tanks on the way home from work. I'm not proud of it, but it happens. n nAvoid it if you can, but if you can't just remember to bathe once you get home.",1
"Just got back from eating there and thought they were all right, but certainly had better. n nI ordered a salad to start, the croutons were really good but the rest was swimming, or drowned, in dressing they poured onto my salad. I figured they would give me the dressing on the side so I didn't think to ask about it, my salad was drenched in honey mustard. n nI had the Absolut Tortellini which was also drenched in the sauce. What I didn't like about it, which I wish they mentioned in their menu was that it is loaded with onions. I like onions but that was way too much, I couldn't even finish it. n nThe lemon cake and the strawberry lemonade were the only things I really liked. n nOur server was friendly and nice but the waitress on the opposite side of our booth that served the customers next to us, kept blabbing on and on about her life, which was annoying, I wouldn't be surprised if the customers were annoyed too they kept trying to order but she would keep on talking. n nProbably will come back once a year, wasn't very exciting to me at all.",1
Went here two days in a row for lunch while at a conference being held at the Phoenix convention center. It was a real quick walk from the convention center and the second day I went they remembered me from the day before which is always nice. I had the Panang curry and it was solid but I ordered it a 3 for level of spicyness and definitely could have done a 4. The soup they provide upon seating you is pretty good as well. Would recommend for lunch if in the area.,2
"When we first walked into the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess to be walked over to our table but decided to hang out at the bar for a bit til the rest of the group arrived. When we were ready to be sat, the hostess and servers were extremely helpful and offered to transfer our open tabs to the table. n nOur group shared a few appetizers that were pretty good. nEveryone's favorite was the octopus though. we liked it so much that we had to order a second order. n nFor dinner our table decided to stick to only ordering from the heritage steaks. We got the skirt, wagyu, and the filet. The wagyu was obviously the best but that pricetag.yikes. Regardless the piece of meat was a work of art. It was incredibly tender and pretty much just melted in your mouth. There was very little chewing that had to be done. Probably the most rich and flavorful piece of cow I've ever consumed. Puts a smile on my face thinking about it. n nAs far as sides go, nothing stood out but the brussell sprouts. Very good flavor. n nThe restaurant is modern and clean with dark wood accents. Lighting sets the mood for a nice dinner out. Overall I loved the layout, however it's a bit confusing when youre looking for the restrooms. I accidentally almost walked into the kitchen twice trying to find the restrooms.but everything happens for a reason.I ended up getting a tour of the back and front kitchen from one of the GMs. They really knew how to make a girl feel special n nThe service was perfect. The servers not only gave us great suggestions but also brought everything out in a timely manner. I was in and out of a full service meal in less than 2 hours and made it to work with time to spare. n nThe tour of the kitchen really gave me a sense of how things were done here at Heritage and how seriously they take their craft. I guarantee that I will be back.",2
"Our trip was earlier this month, after reading the reviews I was very apprehensive, almost switched to another hotel. But we decided to see for ourselves. The lobby was under construction, but we actually found it amusing to see the different labrynth of walkways every time we went through. Also enjoyed seeing the transformation. Construction noise in lobby very loud. Construction noise in suite not a trace until our last day. Even with the new building letters being hoisted past our window. n nWe checked in on a very busy day, had a slight issue with requested room, but front desk after a few tries ended up getting everything right. Our suite was perfect and it was an old V suite not yet remodeled, there were no issues with housekeeping, plumbing, or anything else in the suite. n nWill miss staying here will have to quit smoking so that we can stay again. Transformation to Delano looks wonderful, very upscale and again front desk was super accommodation, there was just one glitch that they worked out to our satisfaction.",2
"Closed for the winter once again but available for holiday parties apparently this year? Could be cozy, rattly and magical! If you do it let me know how it goes!",2
"What an amazing meal, served by a wonderful staff. While visiting Montreal over the weekend, my boyfriend and I wanted to have a great last meal, and picked Au Petit Extra. We made a reservation over the phone with the friendly host, and knew that we'd have a great time right away. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and shown to our table. Our waitress was sweet, helping us pick a wine we'd enjoy and navigating us through the menu. The food was incredible. My boyfriend had the Monkfish with Squid Ink, which was beautifully presented and delicious. I had the steak, which was the most buttery and flavorful flank I've ever tasted. Merci beaucoup, Au Petit Extra. We will be back!",2
"We went to ihop for a quick light lunch. We decided to share the chicken quesedia. We had a very sweet young woman as our server. The restaurant was not busy when we were seated. She brought our beverages in a timely fashion. However, it took forever to get our quesedia. the portion size was ample, more than enough to share for a light lunch for two people. and it was quite tasty. and the price was right by for lunch for two for under 10 before the tip. if we could have been served in a more prompt fashion this would have been a 5 star review.",2
"It was easy to get an appointment. However, the first time we used them we were still seeing black pincher bugs. The following month we tried them again and we are now seeing spiders! The pest control worked for the cockroaches, but we never had an issue with seeing either of the black pincher bugs or spiders until we used js pest control. Since I used a groupon they will not come out and respray. Thus, don't waste your time or money unless you want to start seeing some new bugs in your house!",1
This place has AMAZING food! I had the Kobe beef burger with sweet potato fries.YUMMMMM. We also had some appetizers. They were all delicious!,2
"This theater is typically not as clean or comfortable as other Regal Cinemas located at other station casinos. Specifically, I nearly always have a better movie watching experience at Sunset Station or Green Valley Ranch. The employees are friendly at Boulder, and it's entrance is right near the parking garage exit, so that's nice to not have to walk through a smoky casino to get to the theater.",1
"First time here. I live out in Gilbert so I don't really know many coffee spots in this area. Used yelp to find this place. Ordering was very quick and easy. I hate when you go to some places and you can't even find their menu. Menus were all over the place here. n nI followed others advice and ordered the iced Mexican mocha. Man was it delish! Very flavorful with a hint of spice without being overly rich. Awesome drink and would definitely get again. n nI also got the breakfast burrito that comes with egg, Jack cheese, sausage and some salsa on the side. I added bacon to it also. The burrito was very good. I've definitely had better but I've also had MUCH worse. The bacon I added was crispy which is a big surprise. Usually in places like this it's soft and gummy. Overall, it was above my expectations n nIf I'm in the area, I would absolutely come here again.",2
"BEST cake Ever. Doesn't taste anything like what you think bundt cakes are. Moist, tasty, light and VERY addictive nThe Chocolate Chocolate Chip ones are amazing. The Red Velvet is my 2nd fave.",2
"The food is simple and can be acceptable but not for quality price. The service is relatively slow, so it would be wise to order a small appetizer beforehand. n n nAs for the atmosphere, they tried to incorporate the open ceiling concept with modern looks. Some might find it nice, some might find it chaotic.",1
"So there were some very good things about this hotel, but all of the negatives outweigh the good and ultimately make this a hotel I wouldn't stay at again. nFirst, a disclaimer I am a Hilton Diamond VIP. I spend a huge portion of my life in hotels, and Hilton is my chain. So I get hooked up. And so it's weird when I go to another chain and don't get any perks or a choice room. However, I be that most people who are going to stay here AREN'T high on their loyalty program, so their experience may be a lot like mine. nI stayed here for a business convention for 3 nights. I was put on the 6th floor in the ""atrium. "" Yes, atrium is hotel for ""noisy. "" Because it was. Very, very loud. The whole floor is open to the meeting area below, and night time events are hosted here until well after 10 p.m. One night I woke up at about 2 a.m. because drunk women were shouting and having too much fun. Too loud to fall asleep stay asleep? Deal breaker. nProblem 2 my shower drain was completely clogged and the tub filled up and random hair was floating in it. Gross. So here's the thing. If housekeeping cleans the shower at all, they have to run water. If they run water, they have GOT to see that the tub isn't draining. So they should call maintenance to fix it. So this means that either the housekeeping staff didn't bother to clean the shower OR they didn't bother to have the drain fixed, either of which is lazy and totally unacceptable. I had to shower in the gross water filled tub on day 1. To their credit, it was fixed after I called, but the point is that I should never have had to call. nThe wifi was extremely slow, to the point where I started turning the wifi off and connecting with the 3G. It really was that bad. nThe bed was decently comfortable, but the sheets were worn to the point of having small holes and should have probably been replaced 30 washes prior. nThe attention to detail just wasn't there. nLast, the check in process is just bizarre. They have self serve kiosks, but someone from the front desk checks you in using the self serve kiosk. Why have them? Checking into a hotel is actually one of the only times I prefer checking in with a human, so just eliminate the kiosks. nThe staff was exceptionally friendly, which was great, and the wait for the elevators was never too bad. Valet is expensive, but they're generally pretty quick about bringing your car around. nThe hotel is kind of in the middle of nowhere right downtown.however, there are a few places nearby to grab a quick lunch, and there's a Starbucks right across the street. Score! nSo although there were some great things about the Hyatt, over all this is a hotel I wouldn't come back to.",1
"I made an appointment for someone to take a look at my roof. They were 15min late so I just left since this was for a rental. They called me later and said I didn't need to be there, which was not what I was told by the person who set up the appointment in the first place. n nSo this was on the 16th and sure its the holidays, but why does it take this long to drum up a bid? So I sent a message through the website to which I didn't receive any response. Then I called and an answering service took a message saying they were open that day and would call me back. n nI've pretty much given up on this company at this point. ",1
Very nice and pricey hotel in the perfect location if you want to explore Old Montreal and the tiny Chinatown. n nRight across the street from the underground and also a couple of blocks from a nice indoor mall. n nNice rooms Westin has the best beds around some with views of the city. n nThis is a good hotel for walkers and explorers.,2
"Let me start by writing that the service was good, the waitress was prompt and attentive to the two of us. We were seated in a small room with 5 tables which was fine except that it was stuffy and a good look around the outdated room revealed a great deal of dust on rails etc. this of course makes you ask . What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, the lobster was chewy and the pasta had good flavor but vastly overdressed with oil or butter. My lamb was very good, except that lighting a rosemary twig for no purpose except to fill the room with smoke, is very unappealing and choking , especially when most diners have that dish. How is it a good idea to smoke people out? I think it takes away from he dish. Just put fresh rosemary on the plate , would be much more aromatic. The wine list is extensive and way overpriced 300 mark up on some wines is unacceptable . I also think a water bottle should be opened at the table and not brought open to the table , makes me wonder . nI would also note that the food plates arrived quickly which is good although spending 360.00 and being out of there in 90 minutes can leave one wondering what just happened. nOverall, it is not on my return list.",1
I've always sat at the bar. Selection of drinks is good in my opinion. Bartenders have always been nice.,2
"I found Wave House Cleaning on Yelp thanks to the great reviews people have written about them, and I can tell you, it is all true! Kelly has been extemely responsive, they quote a very fair flat fee for cleening, and the teams stays as long as it takes to do a good job. The cleaning is not just dusting and staightening it is squeaky clean. When I need flexibility can you come tuesday instead of wednesday even last minute they accomodate the request. I was so pleased with the first cleaning that I signed up for their very reasonable weekly service and I couldn't be more pleased. Darrell and Gabbie are friendly, hard working, conscientous employees, and Kelly manages her business with customer service first. I highly recommend contacting Wave if you are looking for reliable, well priced, friendly, good house cleaning! Heather",2
Great Breakfast! They even leave water and a coffee pot at your table. They had new hash brown potatoes today. The old one were like fried chips. The new ones are 100 better love them. As for the protein pancake a must try it's great.,2
"NEVER AGAIN! at least not for me.this is a hotel for a different crowd nFor me, the best part about this hotel was that happy hour, which lasts until 8 serves 5 glasses of decent wine. But you can get that without having to stay here overnight. n nI arrived to work being done on the outside of the hotel apparently some rain damaged the drywall huh? so had to drive around the side to park, where there is nobody to direct you to where the front desk is, or heaven forbid be there to help you haul your bags up a flight of stairs. Later I learned that the elevator down there wasn't just for parking it could have taken me to the lobby, so again it would've been nice if there was sombody down there to let a newcomer know what is where. Not much in the way of hospitality but then again, this is a glorified Holiday Inn. n nThe lobby is okay in that it's very bright, clean and somewhat hip. The bar is off to the side where there is also a nice outdoor lounge. Like other Yelpers, I was a little confused by the two computers in the bar acting as the business center, but whatever. n nMy room was pretty nice. I liked the retro, mid century look and feel. This hotel's big selling point was the hard wood floors but in my opinion, the floors were a HUGE mistake. Firstly, they are cheap laminate, not hard wood and anybody can tell. But worst of all, the floors make sound travel from room to room! I was able to hear everything next to me and above me. And on this random Wednesday night, my floor and the floor above me was an all night party I mean college kids running up and down the halls like crazy people, doors slamming and I mean SLAMMING and what sounded like a game of marbles above my head This went on until 4 in the morning. I think that the low price point and hipsterish feel here makes it the perfect place for a twentysomething crowd, but not a business traveler like me. Free internet and parking does not make up for the circles under my eyes. So bottom line is, if I were 22 and partying with my friends, this would be a fantastic hotel. For work or a romantic weekend in Scottsale, notsomuch.",1
"Unfortunately I was completely unimpressed by Bachi Burger. In fact, I truly regretted wasting precious room for calories and fat on Bachi Burger and wish I had went over to Miko's instead and gorged on sushi and deep fried rolls. n nTo start off, the bf Landon L. and I stopped in around 10p on a Sunday night and the place smelled horrible. I realize that parts of Las Vegas have this disgusting smell and if you happen to be the unfortunate restaurant, I feel badly for you. However, I cannot help but have to include into the overall experience. n nWe asked to seated outside but they weren't serving outside for some reason so we sat at a table close to the back. This helped a lot with the smell. Apparently, whatever it was was confined mainly to the front of the restaurant. n nThe service was very friendly but slow. It felt like forever waiting for our burgers. We ordered the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the black green burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries, all of it quite boring and unimpressive and over priced for what you get. Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to pay a lot of money for good food. For example, 19 for the Buffalo Burger at Burger Bar?! HELL YES. Any day! Worth every penny. n nI felt that the burgers at Bachi lacked flavor and punch. They try to make them complex and ""fusiony "" but the ingredients were incohesive. First, the Miyagi came with a fried egg, which was overcooked. I guess when I order a burger with a fried egg, I expect the yoke to have some sort of runniness. The black and green was okay, but really sweet. And the Truffle Parmesan Fries were just okay as well. We also ordered 2 beers. All of this came to 45. I would rather have given my 45 to Five Guys or In and Out. n nI'm sorry but though the food is okay, I think everything about the menu is pretentious and the price tags are way too high.",1

"Where do I start, this is the first time here for lunch. The restaurant was very clean, decor was very nice, service was very good, but the food was horrible. n nWe started off with the 1, Goi Cuon Tom Thit Shrimp and Pork Spring Rolls which had no taste not even the peanut dipping sauce that accompanied them, the rice skin was tuff and chewy. We then had 21, Pho Tai Noodle Soup w Eye Round Steak . The bowl came out piping hot which I loved, but the broth was dark and GREASY, there was 3 tiny tiny pieces of Eye Round Steak. There was absolutely no taste in the broth. In addition, 25, Pho Tai Chin Nac was exactly the same. n nI love taking photos of my food and posting. Unfortunately I couldn't, as ALL the dishes looked so unappealing visually. n nSorry to say, with all the competition around, I will not be coming here again, and just a tiny bit of advise, get rid of the Emoji on the front of the menu, it does not match with the feel of the restaurant decor inside.",1

"" As if to try and convince us not to stay. My fianc u00e9 and I just looked at each other, handed back the buzzer and left. n nI have been here and the food was decent, but the service has always been horrible, and something tells me there is a reason they only have 4 people serving a half empty restaurant. n nI'm not one to write a bad review either, actually I don't know that I've ever written a bad review, or any reviews for that matter. This experience just irritated me enough to get back on yelp and let others know to go somewhere else.",1
Don't believe the hype people. Los Angeles has way better Thai Food. The food isn't bad just way over hyped. Also the worse service ever. Waited over 40 minutes on two separate occasions for our orders when they told us it'd be 20 minutes.,1
"Some restaurants try as the may do not have good lunch service. Especially when they are understaffed. nWhat I noticed straight away was there were only two waitresses scrambling around the dining room trying to assist everyone all at once. With 80 of your dining room full that is a recipe for disaster. n nI overheard the people sitting next to me complaining about their wait time and that set the mood for the rest of lunch. n nI got the 1 4 rotisserie chicken no sides and a tilapia salad. The price for the 1 4 chicken no sides is on 4.20! For only 4.20 I'd take the chicken over a 10 piece Mcnugget any day. The flavors were there. The spices that the chicken was marinated in really penetrated down into the meat, but sadly the wing on my chicken was dry and I found it very difficult to chew through the tough wing meat. n nMoving on to the tilapia salad my tilapia was not plated on a bed of lettuce but instead was served next to the lettuce . All the ingredients of a salad were there, lettuce, tomatoes , cucumbers , cheese and protein but there was no harmony. It was just a handful of lettuce next to a piece of fish. nI asked for a to go box the waitress forgot. I watched her clean off two tables and had to remind her about the to go box. n nAn absurdly crispy chicken wing and over whelmed wait staffed did no help to boast my star ratings for AJ's Inca Peruvian Restaurant.",1

"The rating is more like a 4.5. I have driven by this place numerous times and finally decided to stop by last Friday. Its a nice place inside with a gaming bar sushi bar and dining area all separate. The rolls and drinks are 1 2 price on the weekends and its 24.99 for AYCE. The sushi is yummy with good flavors, textures, and sauces. Our waiter was a very nice guy who told us his name is Jose which was laughable but for some reason works for him LOL Anyways the sake bombs and beers are cheap and they are on it when it comes to refills! Its a clean place which is a key point for me and my hubby. It wasn't very crowded but the few that were in there seemed to be enjoying themselves. Ill definitely be going back since its close to home and just plain yummy. To me the Alaskan roll and the Lisa Lisa are just so good. While the husband enjoyed the Hot Spicey which had a garlic sauce on it that was too full of vinegar for me. Cant wait to come back again!",2
Never order for delivery! Ordered and they never showed up. Don't know how the food taste because I never received it.,1
"I saw their TV commercial for sirloin steak and all you can eat shrimp so I had to check it out. When I got there, at lunch time, it was so dark that I couldn't even read the menu. When the waitress came over and asked me if she could bring me anything I said Yes, a flashlight. I tried moving to several different tables where there was enough light to see the menu and finally gave up and left.",1
I've eaten here several times and each time is indeed a pleasure. I love the bar area but I think my favorite thing about the place are the quaint little booths with the curtains. That creates a little shelter that gives you some privacy during a nice romantic meal. I'm a fan of the trout dish specifically but the fish tacos are also a great endeavor! Service is close to 5 star and everyone seems very polished in their waiting skills. Definitely a place I need to visit more often!,2
"I have always really loved going to Kennywood. I can't wait until I can start taking my kids as they get older. It's such a Pittsburgh tradition. I have never been to fright nights in October but I have been every summer and also to the Winter Light Up display. The potato patch fries are the best in the world, the Thunder Bolt is my all tine favorite coaster and the Exterminator is so much fun. There are some rides I can't ride as I'm onset now because they make me sick, but Kennywood is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who has yet to go since it is fun for all ages. Make sure to get dip n dots and cotton candy on the way out.",2
Yay a new place to add to my list of good grub and a menu that makes me want to come back several times to try out more. n nMy girlfriend and I went for dinner last night and had a great meal. She got the chile rellano plate and I got a filet salad. Yes I know I just said salad but it had filet mignon on it and jalapeno bacon. I mean come on it's not healthy especially with the chipotle ranch dressing on it. It was just what I needed. I had a bite of the chile rellano and I thought they were good as well. n nLike I said there were many other things on the menu that I for sure want to try so I will be back and hopefully soon.,2
"I still think this is the best place to get a steak in Charlotte. Bold statement. right? n nIf you haven't been here, there's a good chance you have passed right by it and not even realized what it is. My mom actually asked if it was strip club. It's not fancy. When you walk inside, you feel like you stepped into an episode of the Sopranos. Very old school feel. n nWhat to order nAppetizers you really can't go wrong with any them. Keep in mind though. you have a lot of food coming. n nMeal The specials are all really good. However, you absolutely can not go wrong with the filet and shrimp scampi combo. The filet cuts like butter. The shrimp. perfection. Bonus dinner comes with a side and salad. At most steakhouses, both are extra. The salad spread comes to your table. You get to make your own. All the dressings are homemade. Feeling naughty? Get the blue cheese. Every calorie is so worth it. n nDessert I don't care how full you are. Get apple pie with cinnamon ice cream. n nDeal alert Mondays and Thursdays you can get half off glasses and bottles of wine. n nService is top notch. If you want to do a Friday or Saturday, you may want to call ahead to make a reservation. They get pretty busy.",2
"You know, I'd love to write some snarky review rife with clever yet insulting puns about this place, but in reality, I actually had a great time. Yes, the 20 cover charge is ABSURD and the drink prices are higher than they should be, but you forget you're in Vegas! EVERYTHING is more expensive than it is supposed to be, so you have to put it in perspective. I blew 35 on the CSI Experience which, btw, the only thing I experienced was boredom and paid 10 for a beer at Excalibur of all places! The nerve! , so really, 20 isn't that bad. n nThe music was pretty entertaining, typical top forty but mixed well. The crowd was diverse and entertaining to watch, especially the white boys from middle america who forgot to pack their rhythm. I also really enjoyed the performances on stage, including a gymnast on a russian wheel. n nHowever, I didn't enjoy that people are allowed to smoke indoors, but that isn't Krave's fault. that would be the great state of Nevada. I also have a real problem with the unbelievable ness of the go go dancers' packages. I mean, sure, if I were a go go dancer I would probably place a little something in my chones to accentuate my goods. but this dude straight up had a week's worth of wardrobe stuffed in his crotch. It reminded me of a full diaper and it wasn't sexy.",2
"Really unimpressive. The ambiance was a little dark and gloomy for a breakfast place. Staff seemed really rushed and not as service oriented. I mean its okay for a restaurant to just provide the bare minimum service for a typical, come order, serve food timely, and give bill timely etc but I guess them being located in a better part of the city I was expecting a little too much. Anyways, I was seated, and ordered the avocado omelette which could have been the most disappointing omelette I have ever had. Period. It was too watery inside, and the sundried tomatoes were all over the palce. The avocados itself just came in chunks leaving the whole flavor meal to go south. The sides, toast and homefries that came were just depressing. t Too greasy and just not loved enough. I also ordered a chocobanana shake which was another let down. Anyways for a bill of 50 for two wasnt a cherry on top either Price was for the location yes it was expected, but being hopeful for a great brunch and not having it was just a nil situation. Not coming back again. ",1
This is a cute little coffee shop. Met here to do some business earlier today and it was perfect just quiet enough to have a good conversation and close proximity to the parking garage getting in and out was a breeze.,2
Got an oil change here. Abraham was awesome. Knew a few details about my car that I didn't know. Transaction felt great. I'd go back for sure. One thing he had this other guy doing some work on my oil change but I'm not sure he was an employee. Maybe being trained? I'm not sure. He was overseen the whole time but still I didn't quite know what to make of it.,2
"I am surprised to be The Loft's first Yelp review! I checked in last night while at the bar and asked a couple friends if it was a new place. No, they said, it's been around probably 3 years. Hmm. interesting. n nThe Loft is on the small side with over half the space taken up by a very large bar. The bar is able to seat probably 40 50 people. There is also another room just a stair step and half wall away with darts and high top tables. While I was there, a large group of about 15 or so people had pushed together all the tables and were hanging out in that space. n nSince it's September, I would normally order a pumpkin beer. However, I tried my husband's and thought it was terrible. Now, I like girly drinks, but this beer was sickeningly sweet. Plus, they lined the rim of the glass with I believe cinnamon sugar which made the glass, my hand, and the table a sticky mess. On top of the messiness, this took the beer to a whole new sweet level. Needless to say, I ordered something else a Breckenridge Autumn Ale, which was absolutely delicious. n nThe odd part about The Loft is that there is no kitchen. However, they provide D's Six Pax Dogz menus for you to order from. My thought was that the process would work like this. a Select menu items, b Order with bartender, c D's delivers the items. But, oh no, it's more complicated than that. It works like. a Select menu items, b Go downstairs and next door to order from D's OR call them from your cell phone but the number is nowhere on the menu, so either use Google on your phone or hope you have a friend on hand who has the number , c After 20 minutes or so, walk over or back over to D's to pick up your to go order, packed up in styrofoam containers. n nI almost gave this place only 1 star, but though it was odd and though I don't plan on going back any time soon, it wasn't that terrible. My recommendation would be to just go to D's Six Pax itself and skip this place altogether.",1
"First of all about 10 minutes after you talk to Jeff ya gonna wanaa give'em a hug. He's like a big'O teddy bear and a sweetie pie ta boot! Even his crew that worked on my bathroom were just a bunch of sweethearts. Just really nice people with good, positive energy.

"I recently moved from California and thought I would start the journey in trying to find a decent and affordable nail salon. After reading the reviews at Red Rock Nails, I was impressed and thought I would give it a shot. My first experience was really good. I received a fill and the young lady was cordial and the quality of her work was exceptional. However, my second experience was TERRIBLE. The woman kept encouraging me to get a ""gel tip. "" I finally gave in and agreed. The very next morning, I woke up with cracks on 7 of my nails. I went in and they were kind enough to fix my nails. The gentleman who fixed my nails informed me to NEVER get a gel tip. I thought this was odd since the woman the day before was encouraging me to get a gel tip from the moment I sat down in the chair. Long story short, even with this gentleman's assistance.within two days, two of my nails chipped off. Unfortunately, the quality of their work is not so great for the price they are charging. I wouldn't recommend this place. If you do go, ask for TRISH. She was the young lady who worked on my nails the very first time and seems to be the only one that provides quality work.",1

"I want to start off by saying that for the most part, I really enjoy Macaroni Grill. The problem is not with the Macaroni Grill, but simply with the service at this restaurant. My wife and I went this Macaroni Grill a few weeks ago and had a terrible experience. The waitress wasn't attentive. She kept forgetting about us. We left upset. nI am a forgiving guy, so my wife and I tried again. We had a different server this time with the same result. The place was virtually empty, so I would expect that they would pay a little closer attention to us. I didn't happen. I had to flag down a waiter to get the check and get out of there. Very Poor Customer Service.",1
"It is getting one star because I can't give it no stars. n nI am like a battered spouse that stays in the bad relationship because I've been in it for over a decade and am too lazy to leave. Bought several vehicles from this dealership back in the day, when the service and management was solid. n nThe last 8 years it has just been a shit show. The service is terrible. They can't fix anything right the first time. They are rude and incompetent. It really is like being in a bad dream dealing with these people. n nTodays laugh.

Sorry Ms. Tuesday, any day of the week is not going to cut it for me. I am completely disappointed.",1
If I could give them no stars I would. I have had repeated problems every time I go here. I am DONE! Everything from slow service to cold food wrong orders and RUDE employees.

"My husband and I recently purchased a resale home that was supposed to be professionally ""move out "" cleaned by Kiwee's Cleaning Company. Apparently Kiwee's had been cleaning the seller's home on a regular basis for some time. The day the cleaning was scheduled for was the same day that we got the keys to our new home. Unfortunately, there was a mix up with the water company transferring service and so the water was not on when the cleaning crew showed up. Instead of working with us and rescheduling, the crew just ""cleaned "" the house without water, if you can even imagine the concept. We were glad to pay a cancellation fee and have them come back once the water was one, but, instead, they did a less than mediocre job, took the seller's check for 250 and split. n nNeedless to say, the tubs and sinks were left filthy. The tile throughout the house was not mopped. Every cabinet was wiped out with Simple Green, which left a sticky residue. Now, this is all to be expected due to the fact that the crew was ""cleaning "" without any water. This was completely mind blowing that a local company would conduct a service industry business this way. n nNow, keep in mind that was the result of the crew ""cleaning "" without water. In addition to that, I was shocked that on a ""move out "" job, the fridge wasn't moved so that the floor behind it could be swept or wiped, the oven was not cleaned, the medicine cabinets were not wiped out, the baseboards were not cleaned nor the grooves in the windows. n nPlease think twice about using this subpar company. When I saw an ad for Kiwee's services recently, I could not refrain from posting this review on Yelp even though I have never posted a review of anything up until now. I find it troubling that Kiwee conducts her so called cleaning business in such an unprofessional manner. We were speechless, literally, by the experience. A disgruntled homeowner",1
"So.we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back.dryer than sand.

Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better.",1
"We had a wonderful experience here. The service is top notch, and the wine selection is outstanding. We ordered the yellowfin tuna appetizer nice blend of flavors and textures ponzu contrasts with crunchy fried veggies ceviche that had generous portions of shrimps and scallops, and some oxtail not at all greasy or fatty! . Finally, the paella! Took 40 minutes to cook, but well worth the wait. We ordered the black blood sausage version. Generous with the saffron, and the texture was perfect. Only criticism was that the meat was a bit on the scimpy side. While somewhat pricy, well worth the price.especially after making a minor killing on the the 1 slot machines right before love those double diamonds! ",2
"For those of you who have written good reviews about Jasmine Tokyo you've got to be kidding! Although the dining area is comfortable and clean, and the people who clean your table are friendly and attentive, there is a big problem the FOOD! n nI don't know what good a large selection of sushi does you if it isn't very good. Of the eight types I sampled, one was decent crispy onion tuna, despite having only a tiny morsel of fish . The other seven were fair. A big problem is that even at 6pm, when things should be really fresh, they weren't. n nThe tempura was very oily, the non fish dishes orange chicken, chicken with mushrooms, broccoli beef were nowhere near as tasty as those you get at a shopping center food court. And how did Jasmine Tokyo manage to make roasted duck with skin that was crispy and chewy at the same time? I'll tell you how it had been sitting around for hours . n nSeasoning is not a talent of the food preparers I will not call them chefs the spicy tuna was not spicy, nothing had salt or other condiments that I could discern, and so on and so on and so on. n nDon't save your appetite for desert it is pedestrian at best and has nothing to do with the Orient. n nA few things were okay, namely those where good ingredients and decent recipes are all that is needed the plain shrimp, the custard, the hot and sour soup. That's about it. n n 22 for this? Even with 20 off, it's still at least 10 overpriced.",1
One star is too much for this toilet seat of a hang out. While there for about 40 minutes I saw a woman vomit in her mouth and then proceeded to swallow her own vomit. I saw drug dealing. Child abuse. Cheap drinks and cheap food can't make up for the scars this place is going to leave in my psyche. If I could give this place negative stars I would! 10 stars. Horrible. Don't wast cab fare going out to the vile hang out spot.,1
Ordered slab of ribs and ribs were over cooked. There was supposed to be bread with the ribs but could not find the bread until I looked under the American fries and then found the bread all soggy. Other people in party ordered pork sandwich. Thought it would be pulled pork but was not. That would not have been so bad though but meat was cold. No decor to speak of and not friendly people to deal with. Would not go to again.,1
"This was probably the worst hotel location I have ever stayed at. The rooms were nice, but the plumbing was awful! The toilet flushed very slow, and the drain in the shower was also very slow.

"Went there with my wife this last Thanksgiving. We had a ""date night "" without kids so we decided to try out this place mainly because of the positive YELP reviews, as well as the great location. If you sit outside, there is a great view of the Bellagio outdoor water show. Our view was blocked at times, however, by those advertisement trucks that pollute the Vegas Strip. They have heat lamps so it is still pretty warm even once the sun sets. We ordered the filet mignon pretty good here with the roquefort butter. The ambience was perfect for a romantic dinner. We didn't feel rushed by our waittress and she was very nice, checking on us from time to time without being too intrusive. We usually don't take longer than an hour or hour and half for dinner when it's just the two of us, but because it was so relaxing we stayed for close to two hours! Wouldn't recommend this place for those with kids but overall had a great experience! Next time we are in Vegas, we'll definitely drop by again! n nBy the way, make sure you make reservations before you go as it gets crowded. You can make reservations online too I believe.",2
The worst hotel I ever stayed in Vegas. nFeel like haunted motel style. nIf we can rank 0.5 star I like to do it.,1
"Not really busy tonight yet it has already taken half an hour since we ordered, still no food! Server just came by and apologized which doesn't help my starving children! Management came by and as I asked for a check for drinks and appetizer she promised food would be out in less than two minutes. Food came out immediately, restaurant comped our meal and continuously checked to make sure everything was good. Started our bad, but they saved it. Food wasn't the greatest, but we will give them another try.",1
"Hidden costs and terrible customer service. The 99 car rental advertised online cost 207. They were unable to locate the insurance policy that I selected when ordering online, and I was presented with three more expensive insurance policies I have sense learned that the insurance was optional . When they ask you for the license of everyone in the car, they charge extra for each, assuming they'll all be driving. The customer service dept. was the rudest group of people I've ever dealt with professionally. Not only were they useless, they were condescending and curt. Good luck deciphering the cryptic receipt to understand your charges. n nWith all the other car rental options, I am glad I will never have to deal with these people and their disreputable business practices again.",1
