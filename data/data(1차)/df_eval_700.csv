"I was really stoked to go to this place during EDC week to see Alesso on Saturday. My buddy's and I had a table couch that was near a speaker which was loud. That part was awesome the bottles came out in a timely manner, the mixed drinks were okay but other services were sub standard. It took awhile for us to get menus for food and the food itself. Chicken salad? I asked a staff member who was walking around to take a picture of our group and he told me he was busy!? Really three seconds? There was a fight between a women and a guy. She was tackled by the security guards. To top it off someone ""contaminated the pool "" which was closed early. Too many bros and over served people. Never again! Two star because Alesso was really good!",1
"My friend and I were on vacation and had another place in mind, but we came here after hearing great things about Rio Mirage. The guac was decent and our meals mahi mahi tacos and spinach chicken enchiladas were okay, but kind of bland. We liked our margaritas but they were WEAK! We ordered mediums which were a pretty good size, but not strong at all. If we come back to Surprise, I'd rather go elsewhere. I think this may be a chain.",1
"I've been there probably 2 times before and have had no problems with this bar in the past. But today will be the last time I ever go there. I was supposed to meet a friend after working and took a seat early hoping to sneak in a drink right quick in prior to the arrival of my friend. I wait for over 5 minutes. No hello or eye contact from the waitress who passes me twice. Its only me and probably 2 or 3 other patrons at the lounge. This place is pretty dead its 11am. Luckily theres ESPN NBA highlights on the TV behind the bar which I start to watch while waiting. n nI figure, screw sitting the lounge I'll just move to the bar, I'm closer to the TV and the bartender isn't too busy I'll get my drink in no time right? Wrong. The bar is empty, like 2 other patrons besides me. About a minute or two passes, still no acknowledgment, hi, hello, nothing. A group of about 5 people show up after me on the opposite side of the bar. He quickly serves the other patron beside me and moves on to the group. At this point I'm done with Moderno. By this time approximately 10 minutes pass and my friend arrives. Frustrated and drink less, I leave and head over to City Bar, another lounge adjacent to Jean Phillipe, where the beautiful waitress hands me my 2 roasted pineapple sidecars in no time flat. n n 3 stars for Moderno's drab, decor and service, or lack thereof. 2 stars for my ""ok "" experiences previously with the bar.",1
"It's about what you should expect for an old, run down hotel. It's badly in need of an update. The rooms are very sparsely appointed with basically zero amenities. No wi if, no decent TV, leaky plumbing and lots of noise. n nThe food is typical Hooters fare, just more expensive and the service is pretty poor. The gaming machines are cheap and blackjack is only 3, so that's one plus.",1
"Wow, I feel like I really discovered something here! When it comes to fresh produce, meat and bakery goods, this is the place to go! Ok so it's technically possible to find higher quality whole foods for instance but who the heck wants to spend that much and I'm not about to drive all the way to Henderson to get hosed! What you'll find here is really great prices, extremely high quality and quite a bit of atmosphere too. There's an in house taqueria and here's something I thought was really cool there's a big window in the center of the back of the store and behind it, there's actually a crew that is physically MAKING tortillas! Maybe I've just spent too much time at Walmart and Smart Final, but as a neophyte, I thought that was pretty awesome. This may not exactly be the place where one would want to do ALL their grocery shopping gallon of milk is 3.99 for store brand as opposed to 3.19 at SnF . But really, if you're going to buy a lot of produce, meat and bakery items, the price and quality of La Bonita will more than make up for it. And while you're there, go ahead and eat a taco. Good times, I'll definitely be back.",2
"This is my favorite post office in LV, I always stop in to drop a post card in the mail on my way to the airport every time I come visit. It's so close to the strip and has really friendly staff so it's great for those over sized items you should mail home instead of risk in your suit case. n nI'll be back PO on Sunset. n nOh and if you have some time to kill, get across the street, park in the flight line viewing lot and tune in and listen to the tower communicate with landing and departing air craft.",2
The other review is spot on. I made a 9 30 appointment. The eye doctor herself came in with wet hair at 9 45! It was another hour after that I was seen.,1
"Finally visited Chicago Joe's after so many friends recommended it so highly. We were very impressed. n nFirst off, reservations are advised, because this place is SMALL. You might get lucky and walk in to find a free table, but don't count on it. Which brings me to another point. n nThis place is located in one of the ""lesser attractive "" parts of Las Vegas. You're not likely to come to this part of town without a destination in mind, such as this restaurant. But missing this place would be a gastronomic loss to you, because the food is THAT GOOD. We had the stuffed artichoke as an appy, and, as difficult and labor intensive as eating an artichoke is, this one was worth the effort. n nFor entrees we chose the meat lasagna and the Chicago hot shrimp w pasta side. Both were absolutely perfect, bursting with flavor. Though the portions weren't enormous, we still required doggy bags. n nMy only caveat was the wine. Not the quality, but the quantity. It was served in a tiny juice glass, and though I wasn't able to do a proper volume assessment, it seemed like a much smaller quantity than one would get in a proper wine glass. For 7 or so, I expected more. Literally. n nThat small point aside, our meal was fantastic. Our waiter Billy was perfect, and had that authentic old school Italian demeanor How YOU doin'? that made the experience all the more enjoyable. Don't miss this place.",2
"Been here for dinner and breakfast a few times and breakfast is the shizzle! Dinner was good, but nothing to write home about. Ok so dinner first, straight forward, nothing unexpected, hubby got ribs he said theyre decent, baked potato was itty bitty, salad is iceburg lettuce, but its all good enough and filling. No complaints, no wow's. Service is good, everyone is friendly. Now breakfast is whole different story not the service, just the food, service has been good any time! . It is soooo good, I got the chicken fried steak and it was awesome, you know how sometimes, it can be all chewy, not here! The portions are HUGE so take your appetite! It was good and its just down home cooking, nothing fancy not the place or the food , but it hits the spot!",2
"Run. As fast as you can in any other direction than this place. I got a Living Social deal to check out this place. I went on the website and you have to register an account to set up an appointment ONLINE because they don't answer their phones during business hours. You read that right. No phone calls. I left a message, emailed and heard nothing. I tried to schedule online, but there is nothing available for the next THREE months. That's the worth customer service EVER. I am happy to go to other places in the area that will take my business. NEVER AGAIN. ps. Living Social would not refund my money but did credit my account. Waste o time.",1
"This was our first year going to Glittering lights. It was ok. The displays were just that. lights. Nothing really spectacular. I thought maybe they would go with the music or something but nope. The station the music was supposed to play on was so static ie you couldn't hear a thing. It was a 15 minute lite up advertisement for participating companies. Probably wouldn't have taken that long but there are other cars you are following and for 20 bucks I was taking my time anyways. Also, the boy scouts were selling 5 dollar kettle corn, which I bought 2 then they asked me for a donation. I thought that was a bit rude, they really give you no choice since they stood in front of my car until I stopped. So it total the night cost 35 dollars, and a 40 minute drive to the location and to be honest we had more fun finding neighborhoods off the news pages and could have saved money. Sorry if it sounds like I'm a scrooge but it was not my favorite holiday experience, my kids really weren't awed either, we wont be back. I think one time is good. At least the money goes to a good cause.",1
"My boyfriend and I like to come here now just for the dessert. He's not into paying to cook his own food so the allure of the meal packages doesn't work on him. But, dessert we will both do, and the Melting Pot is one of our favorite places to do so. n nI love the variety that you get with the dessert fondue cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, cream puffs, strawberries, bananas, multiple types of marshmallows, and pineapples are all cut up into mini pieces perfect for feeding each other behind the closed curtain. We always choose the turtle chocolate and caramel with pecan nuts , and request the dark chocolate instead of the milk chocolate for those extra antioxidants. n nWe recently came to the one on Ray Rd for our Anniversary on New Year's and I was especially pleased with the service. The waiter not only recommended the correct size we would need for the two of us without trying to upsell us and leave us with way too many leftovers, but he also brought us extra pieces of our favorite ""bites "" when we had finished to make sure we were happy and the extra chocolate didn't go to waste. n nI really appreciated the great service and the great food, and for that I say Thank You Melting Pot!",2
I thought it was ok. Was hoping for something different I guess. Wasn't good enough to bring me back. The prices were a little high for the product.,1
"Soo hung over, where to eat? Mon Ami Gabi. nFeeling great and want to grab lunch? Mon Ami Gabi nSick of being in an air conditioned casino? Mon Ami Gabi nWant to have the best people watching sess ever? Mon Ami Gabi nCroque Monsieur or Madam avec le vin day or night? Mon Ami Gabi n n nMon Ami Gabi is my go to answer for almost any question. I have had many many, many, many Vegas trips and pretty much the only thing they all have in common is a meal or two or three at Mon Ami Gabi. I am obsessed with finding the best croque monsieur in the US. which is not easy, but Mon Ami Gabi does a pretty darn good job. The service is always amazing, the patio situated right on the strip is amazing. During the winter it is heated, during the summer it has constant water mist. The wine selection is excellent and the French Onion Soup is the stuff of legends! n nBon app u00e9tit.",2
"Joey's does the most flaky, light, buttery, divine fish and chips I have ever had. Make sure to pay the extra dollar to upgrade to Alaskan Halibut, it is worth it. I have tried the specials on their menu several times with indifferent results, but the fish and chips will forever hold a special place in my stomach. The tartar sauce is also excellent, and they should charge money for the mini corn muffins with honey butter they serve at the beginning of every meal, because I would pay for those. n nOther good things steamed mussels appetizer, if you are a fan of extremely potent garlic, butter and parmesan flavor firecracker shrimp.",2
"I've been going to this Chili's for years the staff is always very friendly and the food is consistently good. My fav is the guiltless chicken sandwich. I love wine, and recently they re vamped their list which I'm really happy about. Try the ONEHOPE Sauvignon Blanc it was great!",2
"Good food at a very reasonable price. I was able to get two tasty, thick pancakes, 4 slices of bacon and two eggs with all you can drink coffee for less than 8.00. The food has lost of flavor and everything was cooked properly. Its a dive dinner, but the food is great.",2
"I am really big into customer service and everyone here hits that out of the park. I do come here quite frequently and it never fails that I get excellent customer service. nI always get a coffee with only Carmel Macchiato creamer. The waitresses never have a problem with my requests, by the way ask for Bre she's the best! Than I always get the half order of chicken, broccoli, mushroom skillet, its awesome that they offer half orders because there proportions are already huge! They have awesome skillets! I also get a side of sourdough bread with apple jelly once again the staff always gets it to me in a respectful manner nI don't have anything negative to say about Egg I. I want to say thank you to this AMAZING staff. I truly feel like home there!",2
"Pho was excellent along with their famous orange chicken. Love the look of their dining room, very modern and fresh. Finished our meal with an excellent Thai iced tea with boba and Vietnamese iced coffee. The drinks were addicting and I may stop going to Starbucks.",2
"Pepe's is not all that and a bag of chips. This is another place that's not far from where I work and it had some recommendations from people that I needed to try it. I'm just not impressed. n nParking, especially at lunch sucks. If you end up parking behind the place over to the West it stinks, a combo smell of grease and sewer that will blast you the second you open your car door. Once you step inside to what looks like an ancient IHOP from the outside you'll find a busy kitchen, ample seating, serve yourself drink fountains, and 2 places to stand for the staff to take your order. And that's where things go South. I've had my order messed up 2 out of 3 times here due to it being lost in translation. The lunch special with 3 chicken tacos somehow ended up as beef tacos, not the lunch special, and at a higher cost. n nAs you wait for your order you can check out the duo salsa bar. 2 types of salsa and the typical pickled Jalapenos and stuff is all you get, and the tomatillo light salsa is the only one I like. It's great for pouring all over the greasy tacos that you'll get. Crunchy yes, but dang, sometimes they just don't taste good at all. n nI've been here a couple of times for lunch now but don't plan to keep them in my lunch rotation. Lindo Michaocan is not far away drive time wise, and they kick Pepe's to the curb in so many ways. If you happen to be driving down Fremont and are just dying for Mexican food this place won't kill you, but it ain't all that either. n n2 Stars. Sorry, that's the best I can give it.",1
"Great friendly service, but it didn't make up for the tasteless food. I got the hummus appetizer plate and a Margherita pizza. nThe hummus had no taste even though it had pickles, red onion and I think a slivers of red bell pepper. The pita bread seemed very dried out. I'm not sure if it was left out for a while, but you'd get a better tasting pita bread from Costco. nThe pizza was utterly disappointing. Yeah, it's fired up in a brick oven yet the dough tasted bland. They don't use fresh mozzarella cheese which ruined it. They do sprinkle fresh basil and sliced tomatoes on top. This has to be the worst Margherita pizza I've ever had. I only had one slice, since that's all I could tolerate. nI gave the place two stars since the service was friendly and the place had a good vibe to it, but I'm not going back. . ",1

"My husband and I had dinner here one evening. I had the 2 taco cheese enchilada, my husband had the 10 two soft carne asada tacos. The Food was delicious! We joined the clean plate club and plan to return, again. We were also impressed with the red salsa which had a solid kick to it, but not too much. I just wanted to add that the restaurant was clean and they are open daily from 6am to 10pm.",2
"I saw the reviews on Yelp and I made my hesitant and unadventurous extended family eat here. Everyone loved it! Everything we ate was really good. The bread is fantastic. Go. From the outside it looks suspect, but its nice inside.",2
"They were recommended by a friend and we used them once with no real issues. This last time was horrible though, really poor unprofessional customer service. They underestimated virtually everything cost, time, delivery etc. I usually give companies a few shots to get it right but I will find a new place to take my clients rugs in the future.",1
Best bagel breakfast sandwiches in the Ballantine area. Good selection of flavored coffee.,2
"Never let down by EPL! Reliable for a quick, affordable, tasty, and potentially healthy depending what you get meal. I always go with the 3 piece white meat combo 2 whole breast, a wing, 2 sides, and a drink for less than 10 bones. Can't beat it! Why get a greasy fake burger at Icky Mickey's when you can have whole white meat that isn't cooked behind an iron curtain. Love that they're grilling whole chickens in plain view! We live nearby so they're our GoTo family spot when we need something quick and cheap.",2
"Avoid this branch! Long lines, very slow!",1
Nice services. Their drunken noodle tastes like basic chow fun. The green curry is decent. The sea food dish is relatively fresh.,2
"I'm definitely a fan of Southwest Airlines. I needed to go to Chicago and found that the other airlines were a bit too greedy. I must admit I wasn't too keen on flying into Midway versus O'hare, but I was pleasantly surprised. n nAbout the only nutty thing I didn't like is that you have to check in for your flight exactly 24 hours before your flight to get a better boarding number. So I got A33 A34 on my first try, not bad for a rookie. They even text me the next morning that the flight was delayed 1 2 hour and also text me when there were gate changes. Got to love this modern technology. I checked my baggage curbside for the first time on a domestic flight in probably about 20 plus years since there was no luggage check in fee. It was nice not having to lug my bag around. It sure made it easier going through security. n nOn the return trip I had to go through the counter since I was coming from the rental car drop off. They have such a systematic check in feature where the sign tells you when and where an agent is ready to help you. n nThe snacks were awesome on the plane as well. I can't remember the last time I had one of those orange crackers with the cheese, YUM. I must admit that I also double dipped and had those vanilla oreo cookies too. n nI will definitely be a repeat customer so I can't wait for my next trip.",2
"Visiting Mint Indian Bistro two weeks in a row definitely warrants a review! n nOur first visit was at dinnertime and we were utilizing our Entertainment Book coupon. For the Husband and I, we ordered n n Karma Korma ""A creamy sauce sprinkled with nuts and assorted Himalayan spices. "" with fresh veggies 12.99 n n Rebel Curry ""This is the Nepalese Gurkha version of the famous curry with a rebelliously inspired exotic blend of curry spices. "" with lamb 13.99 n n Garlic Naan 2.99 n nOne thing I absolutely love are papadums and was so pleasantly surprised when they offered these to us complimentary! Other Indian restaurants don't offer it complimentary anymore! Both entrees were so flavorful and just delicious that we couldn't resist checking out their ever so popular lunch buffet option. n nThe daily lunch buffet is 9.99 with kids 3 and under being free. Ages 4 to 7 years are 5.99. It's offered from 11 30 am to 3 00 pm. n nOne thing I appreciated was that they noted what food items were vegetarian and vegan. As someone who recently stopped eating dairy, I found this very useful. n nWhen ordering naan, I was able to get this sans butter, which was quite appreciative in my situation. And with my new dietary restrictions, I was still able to enjoy quite a lot of food items and left feeling full and satisfied! n nTheir buffet menu can be found on their website, but it does change. n nOverall, we were both quite content with their food, a la carte or buffet. Definitely one of the better Indian buffets in town, especially if you're looking for a vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free menu!",2
"I go to this place all the time because it's so convenient, right by my house. But almost every single time they somehow mess up my order. Mainly when I go in the morning to get breakfast burritos. My boyfriend hates when they are dry so he asks to put a couple extra things in them. If it's dry, he gets upset. Like today, we asked for a steak breakfast burrito with pico. We got a plain bacon burrito! Bacon! Not even close to what we wanted. I'm to the point where I'd rather drive further to a different one to get what I actually want, or just go to taco bell right next door. Now I have to deal with my upset boyfriend.",1
I love this little nail salon! They are so great and amazing! They always remember my mom and i and ask about my daughter! Tony and his wife are so amazing! Great prices and great service! I will always tell everyone to go here!,2
Actually Zero stars for Zero customer service and for the knobs at the check in table who completely ignored me when I went to ask a few questions about the club.The guys in front of me even pointed me out to one of the employees and I know I made eye contact with the other one. Neither one even acknowledged my presence and went to talk to the person after me. I guess I am just not cool enough for Haze. Oh well.Their loss.plenty of other places to spend my money in Vegas!,1
This place is always fresh and delicious. I usually get the ginger chicken bowl or the chicken teriyaki bowl. I've also had the yakisoba noodles which are also good. I try not to eat the crab puffs but they are just too hard to pass up! The man and woman who work the drive thru are always VERY nice!,2
"I had heard about Wok and Wine from a fellow 'special needs' gang member Gluten Free Coeliac and wanted to try it. I'm never the biggest fan of going out for Chinese or Indian due to the association with 'takeaways' but nothing ventured, nothing gained. n nFabulouso! Truly yum. Being GF, I get the special menu. Now normally this can result in a little due to the limited and usually poor choice of not very appetising offers but Wok and Wine rocked n nPages of dishes suitable for me, including those normally totally off limits. Had to go for the shredded chilli crispy beef with a side order of crispy seaweed and it was fab! Nice balance of chilli's for the added spice, but not too much that you can't taste your food with lots of crispy beef and vegetables. Perfectly crispy, crispy seaweed happy bunny. My friends loved their dishes king prawns with ginger chicken and cashew nuts. Off the 'evil' non GF menu so I didn't sample but much noshing and little conversation apart from yum and pretty decent portions they do not skimp on the king prawns which is great to see! mean that we are all planning a return visit. n nNice touches too nice feeling to this place. Channelling the red theme traditionally associated with China but with a modern twist. Prawn crackers provided free and free chicken wings beautiful seasoned crumb and they did the GF version for our table so more brownie points! , as well as coming round to top up water glasses so attentive but not obtrusive service. n nNot much to complain about Wok and Wine is getting 5 stars. Maybe more chilli sauce as only a little dish provided. Chances are, they would have given me more, if I had stopped eating long enough to ask but this was just a minor thing for this GF girl. n nUpdate I was here with my mum recently after raving about fab GF Chinese so she fancied trying it and she's not GF . She ate off the Gluten Free menu tbh she had no choice as I played the ""we can share if you use the GF menu? "" card but was wowed by the choice poor Mum never got a glance at the normal menu which is even bigger . So as Claire L's mum said ""Put on your review on Yelp that I ate off the GF menu there was so much choice! The food is amazing the crispy beef and duck were to die for and I didn't mind that there were no pancakes as the option of making lettuce rolls was much better! "" So there Yelpers, two reviews for the price of one ",2
"Went on a Friday night again, the place was pretty packed inside and out in the patio . We decided to get our food to go this time. The girl at the ordering counter was super nice and friendly. We even tipped her because she was so nice. I ordered a create a burger 1 2 lb, classic egg bun, swiss cheese, and light mayo. The burger was juicy and just so so good. The smash fries are good too. My hubby got the AZ Smashburger Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo, and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun. n nThe burgers just tasted very juicy and a lot better than last time.",2
"I go to Vegas about 30 times a year for business. I have stayed at many hotels. Thought I would go back to Cosmo to earn some Mariott points. I was very surprised when they wanted to charge me another 6.25 for a refill on my iced coffee and charged 9.50 for the water in the room. Expensive even for Vegas hotel standards. When I told an employee who looked like a manager on my way out that I was annoyed that they would not give me a refill on my coffee, he seemed like he could care less.",1
"I've been to Axis Radius about 5 times and have never had a spectacular time. I will list the reasons why. n n 1 If you go on the weekend then the place is nasty packed. I am pretty sure that every time a big DJ comes to town they violate fire code by packing as many people as possible in. On one instance, I had bought pre sale tickets. Upon getting there I waited in line for nearly 2 hours and the line moved about 10 people who were also presale . All the while, people rolling in and paying door price premiums got in. Fuck you Axis Radius for not letting PAID customers in while you let people willing to pay premium prices to get them and their posse in. n n 2 Prices. Drink prices are the highest I've seen. I think a long island my staple drink is about 12. Talk about getting raped this is Scottsdale, not a holiday weekend in Vegas. I will say that I came here one time and they gave my group 5 people a FREE bottle of vodka, with bottle service. I guess Thursdays are super slow days for them. n n 3 Creeper hell. I am a guy and I am weirded out my the creeper groups that seem to plague Axis Radius. Can't people, especially girls, dance without you and your 4 buddies doing a Night at the Roxbury skit where you surround a girl and don't let her go. It's bad enough where I will step in and act like their boyfriend until the weirdos leave. How creepy. n n 4 Trip hazard. I don't know what it is, but I've found more things to trip over in Axis Radius, sober and drunk. I guess that is extra entertainment. n nBottom line stay way unless you want to pay a premium to be mobbed. or are just dying to see a special DJ. As for me, I'm done with A R.",1
"Yelp reviewers, y'all are gonna have me wearing a size larger by Christmas! n nMy daughter and I tried Tasty Yo, spurred by the good words here and my craving for something sweet. n nThe guy behind the counter described the tart yogurt as tasting similar to the Greek yogurt, which I happen to love. My daughter's sweet tooth is different from mine. She doesn't eat a lot of sweets she's a cheese head but she likes her sweets SWEET. n nI got the tart yogurt with Oreo crumbles, strawberries, and granola. My daughter tried the peach mango with sprinkles, Oreo crumbles, and chocolate chips. n nThe store is rather small but I like way they've made use of the space. n nWhy did I have the impression that it was a self serve place? It's not. This is my only grumble. We'll go back but not too often. I love fro yo but I don't always tolerate dairy well. n nWe both enjoyed our choices and it was a nice way to break up our day.",2
Ate here last night and had to remind the waitress we were ready to order. This is the third visit for hubby and I and each time they have an excuse why the service is bad. I ordered the pot roast sandwich. It was dry and tasteless and the kaiser roll was stale. Never again. Oh and they are so over priced for their food.,1
"It is pricey to play this course 240 up depending on your hotel package, but the experience is so worth it. 1st up really cool driving range,ball return mechanism. Haven't seen anything like it. The course is well maintained, beautiful fairways, however the greens were not great as they were being changed over or something?.very long course lots lots of sand to go up against, but nice soft to swing out from. I'm glad I checked it out. Would easily go back again",2
"I was skeptical about going to a typical pizza shop during a food tour in Bloomfield, but boy was I wrong. This pizza is really good and you can tell that they do not pick the cheap ingredients off of the shelf. The dough was perfect cooked well, but kinda doughy and the cheese was excellent.",2
"At first I believed this to be a very nice motel despite my initial misgivings. No one was the front desk but once in the room I saw that was quite nice, well equipped, and very clean . that is until I found the used condom on the floor. I ignored that however and still had a very nice stay though I could not help but notice that, because there are actually two properties right next to each other, communication between the two buildings and staff members was very bad. That was not to become apparent until after I left and tried to contact the management about an item I accidentally left in the room. After 3 calls I gave up and I also gave up on this facility.",1
"Amazing Pho at this place, which we discovered by accident in a strip mall. Don't let the location fool you this is totally worth it. I find myself craving their pho a few times a week!",2
Epic fail. 11pm on a Friday and no one here. The owner's kids are behind the bar monitoring bottles and acting like hot shots. 8 for a 2 drink. Empty dance floor.,1
"Great Mediterranean food. The chicken kebabs were juicy and well spiced. Great rice too! Hummus was thin, but tasty. The grape leaves were serves HOT which was surprisingly good.",2
Best dry cleaners in Scottsdale. Ask for Mike at the drive through. Tell him Stew sent you.,2
"Never again. I was so excited to try this restaurant based on the reviews but was disappointed by their service. First, they served chips with salsa which was good but for a party of 5, they served very little. We asked for more and they told us they had ran out of chips. Wait, that wasn't even the problem. I was the first to get my carne asada burrito and our waitress says, ""we gave you extra beans because we've ran out of rice. Is that OK? "" I didn't want to be rude about it but what kind of Mexican restaurant runs out of chips and rice? Oh, needless to say, they served canned soda, and when we asked for another Pepsi.guess what they said? They ran out! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Rosita's place, which is a block down was beyond better!",1
"Food is alright. Service is garbage. You would expect a lot more from a place with the kind of prices they have. If anything, the food is what gave it the 2 stars.",1
