"I have been coming here for years, I lived across the road in my student days so the lunch time buffet was always a go to for vast amounts of healthy food. Sadly I am never in town these days at lunch, but I have been in for their evening service many times in the last few years so my review is more focused on that aspect. n nBirthday meal for the missus last night who had not been here before and is vegan, so a dedicated veg vegan curry place was ideal. First impressions were I liked the new decor. Service was efficient and attentive. n nNow the food. I always opt for the Thali All three courses served at once on a tray containing little dishes in here on the a la carte, alas my favourite the southern Indian Thali hasn't been on the menu for a while. I opted for the Royal Thali and the missus the vegan thali with popadoms to start. The poppadoms turned up with pickles and a ""with compliments "" . grand. Everything was great they even presented us with a new pickle we hadn't tried before, which was sag and chilli pickle. n nThe mains arrived promptly and what a feast to be presented with lots of curry options, great nan and amazing parkoras. We were too full for the deserts but tried a little of the vegan desert and the rice pud, which were very nice. The food was excellent and filling, just what we needed. One of the best Dal's I have tried. The missus loved her offerings too. The food was 5 stars for me. n nThe only downsides was when I paid up and left without checking the bill. It sounded roughly right but i was in a hurry. We were charged extra for the pickles that were presented ""with compliments "" that we didn't order, the service charge was on there and the beers were not terrible just not good. The taps really need run through a bit. n nAll in well worth a visit for the food. I will be back for the buffet one lunch time, but the extra costs lost a point for what would have been a 5 star review.",2
"I took my daughter here for some braids done by Mary and they didn't even last two weeks, never again!.",1
"Been back. They had some kind of lamb dish on the buffet. I love lamb so I fished the meat out and just ate that, the onion chutney it's a nice moderate spice level , naan, and rice. I think I put away about 2 lbs of lamb. So for 9 dollars that's not a bad deal. n nOnly problem you can't predict when they'll have the lamb and when they won't. n nbah",2
"I'm really surprised this is one of the top rated Arizona Thai places on Yelp. n nFirst, the prices are really expensive and the portions are small. This might be forgivable if the food was amazing, but it wasn't. We ordered Thai beef salad, pad thai, and panang curry. The salad was the most disappointing of the bunch. It was essentially 4 pieces of weird textured meat over iceberg lettuce with onions and some kind of oily dressing. The panang was ok, but nothing to write home about. I'd say the pad thai was the best of what we ordered, but still not the best I've ever had and really expensive for the amount you're given. We ate everything we ordered and still felt hungry afterward. Normally when we order Thai food we end up totally stuffed and leave with leftovers. And for less money and better food. n nIt was disappointing overall. Definitely not worth the price. We have no plans to return. The quest for great Thai food in Chandler continues!",1
"A great place to go with family and friends, have Italian food and drink lots of wine. An unassuming place from the outside on a quiet street in pittsburgh, Zarra's is warm and cozy inside. Do pay attention to the many random objects on the wall, but do not let it distract you from sitting down and enjoying the wine and the company of family and friends. I had the sample plate and it was perfect. A nice sampling of several southern Italian favorites. The wine kep coming, so we kept on eating and drinking. n nFor desert, try the cannolie and a nice espresso. n nNext time that I am on Pittsburg, I am going.",2
"I haven't been to a hookah bar in years and every time I walk by Harem's I think to myself, this looks like the coolest place ever! I took a chance, my girlfriend and I took a seat outside and after waiting a good 5 or 10 minutes someone comes to help us. I ask for a hookah and a couple drinks, apparently she isn't responsible for the drinks so an older guy comes to the table checking Id's, no big deal, but this is when the fun starts. I'm quizzed on everything from my address, hair color, weight and whatever else he felt like asking, I'm 29 and have NEVER had this happen but I go along with it. He then turns to my girlfriend 29 also and does the same thing and eventually denies us service! I have never had this happen to me! n nI suppose I should be thankful because I walked over to Ra after and had a fantastic night but I will never go back to Harem's.",1
"The wife and I dined here for dinner on 8 9 11. Ordered Fried Pickles 4 and Pork Buns 6 for appetizers, the Graze Burger 19! and the Burger of the week 15 , fries with both entrees. n nThis was our first visit to Graze. We had pretty high expectations, seeing as how it is the 'sister restaurant' of L'Etoile. It certainly was the hoity est place we've been to, and with their focus on gourmet, local ingredients, we were sure we were in for a great meal. n nFirst impressions No reservations needed cool! They were very busy, which for a Tuesday night was surprising, but it was election night, and there was a rally going on. The wait to get seated was about 30 minutes, not bad, but they told us 10. Noisy very noisy. near impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The decor seemed like they were trying for an artsy modern look, but all I could think about was how the metal chairs were the exact same kind of metal chairs you always see in interrogation rooms on cop tv shows. Next time you are watching Law and Order, or one of the others, check out the chairs. You'll see what I mean. n nService was slow, maybe we were just impatient because we were very hungry we were in a little bit of a hurry, we wanted to check out the rally. After what was probably 30 minutes, we were finally served our appetizers. The fried pickles were a huge disappointment. There was more breading than pickle. I honestly didn't realize you could slice a pickle that thin! Greasy, very greasy. They tasted like something you would get off a food truck at a carnival. I didn't use the sauce, the wife did and said it was good, so maybe that was the trick. In my opinion food is either good or it's not, and you shouldn't have to drench it in sauce for it to be good. The pork buns were nothing like I was expecting, which could just be my own ignorance. I was expecting pork buns like I remembered from China One Buffet on Broadway back in the day. What we got looked more like a pork taco, but whatever. They tasted ok I guess, not something I would normally order, and I probably wouldn't order again. The wife said they were 'different' which is usually code for 'not very good'. At this point, we were feeling a little leary about our entrees. n nAfter what felt like forever but was probably about 30 more minutes , our burgers fries came. Not sure why it took so long for two burgers and two orders of fries. My burger was the Graze burger fresh ground sirloin, ribeye short ribs, caramelized onions, cabernet jus, sesamse seed brioche The burger did not come with any toppings. Just burger, bun caramelized onions. It looked a little naked, I thought. Now I didn't expect the chef to want to bury his work of beef art under a blanket of cheese even though we are in the dairy state , but a little lettuce, tomato, pickle or even some raw onions really would have elevated this burger to something special. Without all of that it was just ok. The taste texture reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. Which would have been fine if I'd ordered the meatloaf sandwich, but I didn't. I ordered the 19 hamburger. 19! I guess I figured that I since ordered one of the most expensive things on the menu, that it would blow my mind, but it just didn't. My mistake. In fact, I found it a little salty, and not in a good way. n nThe wife, being more adventurous than I am, ordered the burger of the week, which we didn't hear the name of and barely heard the description of. Something about a burger with bacon, limburger cheese, and hash browns, served on a play on french toast. She said it was 'weird, wet and kinda gross' It also was extremely messy, the 'french toast' or whatever it was pretty much disintigrated, leaving her hands a sloppy, greasy mess. n nI know right now you are probably thinking 'sheesh, don't you have anything nice to say?' Yes. I do the french fries were very good. So there you have it. 46.42 after tax for some darn good fries. n nNot what you'd call a good value. Although, after this experience, neither of us is in a hurry to try the 'sister restaurant' L'Etoile, which would have a significantly higher price tag, so in a way, dining at Graze actually saved us money in the long run. n nAn expensive lesson learned.",1
"This isn't going to be a positive post. Partying in Vegas makes me hungry, so one morning I decided I wanted to eat pancit palabok to settle this stomach. That day it wasn't so bad. I ate it and left. n nAfter telling my parents I ate at Goldilocks in Vegas, they push on eating there all the time. The service is horrible, and my chicken arroscaldo had bits and pieces of of bone in it, not cool. My siapo was 3.49, overpriced. n nNothing here is positive that is worth mentioning about. It's even hard to find.",1
"We received fantastic customer service at this location when purchasing furniture for our nursery. Love all the sales here, too!",2
"This is the first place in Vegas I would actually call a diamond in the rough. It's in an unassuming strip mall and tucked away in the corner with a small sign. Without yelp I never would have even known this place existed. Thank god for yelp. The menu is two pages of printer paper stapled together, but sketchy menus be damned. This review is about the food, and this food was GOOD. The specialty burger menu is where it's at. I had the jalape u00f1o popper burger. The burgers are big, 2 3s of a pound big. It's hard to open your mouth wide enough to eat them, but it's worth the effort. The meat was cooked perfectly, the veggies were fresh, and there was the perfect amount of cheese. It was excellent. This is easily one of the top three burger places in the city. The fries are also amazing. They're thin sliced whole potatoes and fried crispy. The fries may have been even better than the burger. Hooligans is where it's at for great burgers and fries.",2
"Pros Tastes like ice cream nCons Custard melts too quickly, slow service, incompetent staff nMy Advice It's worth a try, but in the future I'll likely just opt for DQ n nWe visited Jarling's last night for the first time after reading all the raving reviews. It did not live up to all the fuss. n nWhen we got there, the line was to the door, so we were about 6 or 7 people back at our window. Even with 2 employees working that window it took a good 25 minutes or so to get to the front. n nWhen we finally got a chance, we ordered two single dip cups for the kids, a single dip waffle cone for my fiance and a peanut butter fudge snowstorm their equivalent to DQ's blizzard for me. They guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing. After wandering around aimlessly for several minutes, he finally passed our order on to someone else. Even then it took forever for our order to be made. Meanwhile, the man who I presume was the manager just stood around watching and periodically yelling at customers in line to either come inside or go outside, but to close the door. n nWhen they finally got the order up to the window it was already melting. Then the girl couldn't figure out how to work the cash register, so it took quite a while to get my change back. By the time I was able to get my order, get my change and walk to the picnic tables outside, there was melted custard dripping all over the place. n nThe ice cream or custard was good, but not great and certainly not worth the price. The snowstorm was smooth and had a rich peanut butter flavor to it. On the other hand, I ended up literally drinking it. I wasn't impressed.",1
"By far the worst experience of my life ! I work in a salon and I am usually very understanding and patient with people because I know how it is when your starting out or nervous , or having a bad day . I would rather boost someone's confidence then complain becuase at the end of the day usually isn't that bad. This was far worse then bad. I walked out crying because I couldn't believe what happened. I called in a few days before to make and appoitment. Receptionist was nice and helpful so I was pretty excited . I had picked out a few different ideas with designs and wanted to talk to my nail tech and combine them. When I walked in the receptionist told me to pick out a color. A nail tech walked out and said "" do u have color? "" I told her I wanted to show her my ideas and see how much it was and if they even had the stuff I wanted. With enough attitude she told me that she wasn't doing my nails and didn't know. So I asked her who was doing them. She said she was painting them but someone else was doing the designs . So she took me to her. They both started arguing with eachother about it. Which made me extremely uncomfortable. The most inappropriate behavior I have seen. So I reluctantly showed the girl what I wanted. She quoted me 40 . Not bad . As they start the other quotes me 40. So now it's gonna cost me 80. Both of them are mad at eachother and now taking it out on me. By this time I wanted to walk out but she was half in my nails . When she finished my pedicure I just asked her to match the color on my toes because she about had a meltdown that I had acrylics which now I know she didn't know how to do them . She finishes and they are fat at the tip and not even or flat whatsoever. Also they didn't match my toes at all.I walked paying 130. I cried all the way home and decided to go in the next day when I could cool down. I walked in to tell the receptionist I wanted them fixed. She said they wouldn't only fix them and not charge me anything if I got the same color. Your nail tech is color blind and gave me the wrong color and now you wanna charge me full price to fix her mistake . I asked for the manager and some how they weren't there. I would have given this place 5 stars but that isn't an option on yelp. Don't ever come here. Even if your an optimistic person , they will make you sorry for even thinking about going there.",1
"Last night my boyfriend and I decided to try somewhere new, so we chose this place. We had only received a flyer in the mail and were reeled in because they had gyros. We ordered two along with two philly cheesesteaks for the next day. The gyros were just alright considering it wasn't tzatziki sauce that came with it. The next morning I warmed up my cheesesteak, sat down and had a few bites. While chewing one piece, I noticed there was something hard in my mouth.IT WAS A METAL STAPLE. I will definitely not be eating the rest of this sandwich nor will I order other food here for the fear of more contamination. They should be very glad I didn't swallow it by accident.very big problems then. Needless to say, their manager will be receiving a call today.",1
"Open letter to the management n nThere is something you seem not to know about your wait staff, they try to take advantage of your customers by rounded down the change on a ticket. Let's say a ticket totaled 17.31, and I gave her a 20 and a 10, what should I have gotten in change? Why any 3rd grader will tell you 12.69 broken into 1's and a 5 . What I got was 12.00 even, shorting me you 0.69. Is this a big deal? Not once it's not but after having this behavior happen at your establishment several times it has become a habit with your staff, assuming the change. To compound this, this particular waitress I had called this on her before. I had also informed management before and so obviously nothing had been done. Did I get pissed off, yeah. I certainly did and admittedly a bit over the top . Did a manager both to ask why I was so upset. no. n nOK. so I'm 86'ed from your little place. plenty of places to eat in Vegas, but you should know that your staff is not as honest with your customers as you would like to think and your rep on the street is reflecting of this. I had been warned by a former employee of yours that this was the ""inside baseball "" thing that happened there but I couldn't believe it. Obviously it was true. The shame of it all is unfortunately this sort of behavior has spread to other places, and I would assume it is the economy that spurs this on. n nThe funny thing is, when a server brings me my change rounded the other way so maybe I get a few cents extra back , I usually am sure to tip it back and then some, and people who know me know I am not a cheap tipper. Unless you assume the change and then I am likely to leave nothing at all, seeing as how you've taken your tip already. n nSo yeah, 86 me, but be sure to fire your wait staff, they are doing you a great disservice. And now you know what gets gossiped about your establishment, a rare thing for management to learn, and I'd use it if I were you. n n JB nNeed to contact me yelp visual impact.com",1
"Rolled in with some homies to ingest some greasy food before a bout of drinking. They sat us a beer pong table. That shoulda been a red flag. Hey, fuck it, we're in a sports bar, whatever man. Bring us some sandwiches and beer. Please. Now. n nOur order took the better part of an hour to deliver. Our order wasn't difficult and the place wasn't busy. They don't serve ice water but instead will sell you bottled tap water with their logo on it for a dollar. Hey, in Vegas, everything costs. n nThen they bring out everyone's food except for one guy's. His order takes another 15 minutes to come out. I timed it. The server gave his patty melt to another table they were seated after us. Some guys at the table are done with their meal before homie even takes his first bite. n nAnother one of the homies says that the bell peppers on his cheesesteak are gross and slimy and taste pickled. He brought this up to the waitress an she argued that the peppers are cut fresh every day. She's a liar. Why not just apologize and bring a new one, sans peppers? Argue with a customer about something you didn't cook? The fuck outta here. n nOn top of all that, the hostess allowed a party of six to play beer pong 1.5 tables away from where we were eating. Beer pong balls kept exiting their field of play and bouncing under our table the assholes following the ball. We kicked the ping pong balls into the bathroom. They drank their beers with piss. Beer Pong? Cool, good times! But not where paying customers are trying to enjoy a meal. I hope they tasted the piss. They left after one game. n nIf this sounds like a deal for 25 35, you've found your ultimate sports bar and grill experience. n nTerrible. I hate your guts Blondies.",1
"I was sad to see that posted on the entrance was the sign, GUN FREE ZONE, GUNS NOT PERMITTED, this is just asking a criminal to go in and rob them, they know no one will shoot back. But it is their business and its my money, and I will spend it elsewhere.",1
"Total ghetto. I personally was robbed or locked property stolen 3 times, my 9 year old threatened at knife point and almost shot with bb guns. Looks like its becoming a tweaker paradise there, I had to get out for safety of my family. Think I called 911 or police at least 10 times living there.",1
"The gelato is delicious, the atmosphere not so much. The prices are a little steep also. 4 for one scoop. As much as I would want to go more often, my hubby cannot do without his waffle cone. They do not offer that.",2
Love the happy hour. Courtney is the best bar tender and will take very good care of you even if the bar is full. Megan is awesome as well. Cant go wrong with that pair. Food is always fantastic. Besides great happy hour specials the regular menu is just as equally good. And sweet potato fries mmmmmm need I say more. I love all the PTs in town but love this one the best.,2
They really need to add more employees. I have stood in line for quite a while the last two times I was here. The aisles are pretty close together but that doesn't stop me from buying twice as much stuff as I had intended to buy. I will give them four stars once they hire more people to work the registers.,1
"Definitely won't be coming back. We came in to celebrate a friends birthday. We ordered the Caesar salad dressing tasted like mayo , fried calamari appetizer over cooked, the garlic knots tasted decent, but we waited 30 minutes for the ""dough to rise "" ? , pineapple and prosciutto pizza gross, cardboard tasting crust, and the meat lovers pizza gross, but not as bad as the other pizza. nThe service was awful, and our waitress had ZERO customer service skills.",1
"I would prefer to not even give them a star my experience was so bad. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE out there, but worse than that they overbilled my insurance, got my prescription wrong two times, and took 6 months to order contacts for me. Worst experience with eye doctors. The doctor is very old fashioned and his equipment is as well. I had to contact my insurance several times because of their bills to my insurance company. I had an appointment in December for just an exam and they billed my insurance for that year for contacts that I never purchased. The proceeded to bill my insurance after that for each time I had to come back to the doctors upon the doctors inability to get my prescription right the first time. the front desk is terrible. Angie doesn't know how to use a computer and writes all the appointments prescriptions by hand and someone else enters the information in later. Explains why several of my appointments were overlooked and had to be rebooked. Audra the office manager will never return a phone call and gives you false information regarding prices and insurance. If you are going to go here, you want to make sure that you are prepared to deal with a poor staff, a lazy outdated doctor, and expect a mess with your insurance. n nBOTTOM LINE DON'T GO HERE!",1
As a local who travels frequently for business I was shocked when I called to reserve a cab for 4AM and was told they no longer make reservations. Having to wake up an additional 45 minutes early on an already long travel day to call a cab is ridiculous. Ace has just lost a local that had provided them with rides a minimum or 4 times a week.,1
Reasonably priced and the Paninis are great. Recommended lunch spot! Recommend their buffalo chicken and chicken bacon ranch.,2
"This was a place I wanted to like, but fell short. It was a busy night to their credit, but not impressive. A bit cramped, no personality on the waitress and the food was okay. n nI get it, with the trend of all the ""Artisan "" pizza places opening up, the ingredient were fresh, but I think the atmosphere killed it for me. The ""Cheese Bread "" is nothing more than a cheese pizza and the actual pizza I ordered I did not like at all. n nI was given the opportunity to order something else from the menu, but assumed that I would be paying for both items since a substitution was not offered for my disliking the first dish. I understand, I did order it so I suppose that my fault, but now I know.",1
"I like this new location. The floor plan is more open and it feels bigger than their previous location on 19th Ave. The food is the same, so if you like IHOP you will probably be satisfied on that point. I've been here for five visits at various times and there are a couple of things that are consistent that rate a 2 or 2.5 rating 1 parking is awful and entry is confusing unless you know where you are going. 2 They run out of food. Twice I've been there and unless you get there really early, you might find that your favorite is no long available for the day. 3 The service is awful. They seem to have a 1 to 3 ratio on employees to guests and still the service is awful. n nIf you need your fix of rootie tootie fresh n fruity or whatever pick another location and save yourself a lot of frustration.",1
"This was one of the stops on my recent restaurant.com tour of dining in Vegas. The 25.00 coupon made it a screaming deal. n nI had the signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. It was much better this time than the last time I had it. Perhaps it was because I had a lower blood alcohol content. It's just so much food. It provided breakfast the next morning too. n nMy son 9 had the kids burger with fries. He too got about half way through it. It appeared to be a real hand formed patty. He ordered a side of bacon to add to the burger. I had a piece. I wish bacon like that could be bought in the grocery store. n nMy wife had the Griddled Cheese Sandwich. Delicious and a great value at 10.95. n nThe Bloody Marys were average and I thought overpriced. Not what I would consider 5 star. n nThe service was superior. I think the best service I had anywhere during my recent 3 days in Vegas. They were not crowded, which was nice, on Tuesday about 8PM when we visited.",2
ew. i will never go back. just thinking about my experience makes me want to vom.,1

"We haven't had to do anything major at Best Buy, but they are always helpful when we go in. I've bought some laptops and awhile back had some issues with a couple HP laptops going bad. They promptly returned my money and once when I stopped by the HP and switched to Sony, no more issues. n nThey give us good recommendations on products when we need it and ask. And sometimes even the solution isn't purchasing from Best Buy but elsewhere. This is the kind of service we like and makes them more trusted for us. n nThank you, Best Buy!",2
"I'm not usually a big fan of buffets, but I have to say this one is worth going to. The buffet is clean, organized, and has ridiculous variety. They also have an extensive and very attractive display of desserts. n nMy favorite entrees were the prime rib and salmon. I definitely got my money's worth after a couple plates and two or three ramekins of creme brulee. I took off one star because price per person is expensive and I thought the Asian section was lackluster. It was the one part of the buffet that I would say tasted like ""normal "" buffet food. Honestly I would avoid it altogether. n nI suggest to come during lunch service and stay longer into the dinner service starts at 3pm to be able to try different food and really stretch your dollar.",2
"THE place to be on Badger game day in Madison! The campus sports bar has the usual beers and hoardes of drunken fans.

I usually hit up one of the Lee's when I'm in town. They're ridiculously cheap and usually have a booth with some free samples. Come here if you have a car to save a lot of money and beyond amazing selection.,2
Run.Run far away .run to Fogo de Chao! So worth the extra 20 dollars pp to go to Fogo. The service was great but the food just wasn't good. I tried so hard to like it. Not gonna happen. Salad bar was very limited and the meats were just dry and salty. I'd rather have spent money on 1 good steak than an endless supply of crappy meat. Skip it.,1
"Well, just read all the rave reviews, and wonder if they don't get out much. My husband and I went to Cafe Heidelberg for the second time tonite, mostly because we had a 20 coupon from Entertainment book, and we were seeing a show at the Riviera which is just down the street. I didn't really like the place the first time, but that was quite a while ago, so thought we would try it again. I had cabbage soup to start and hubby had salad. He said the salad dressing was very good, but my soup was bland. I added lots of salt and pepper. I got sauerbraten and he got a combo of wiener schnitzel and some other kind of meat, which he thought was beef. Potato dumpling was not worth the calories, red cabbage was so vinegary I had to sprinkle a little sugar on it to get it down, and my three skinny slices of pork were very soft and tasted undercooked, except for the gravy, which was pretty good. We each had 2 German beers, and split an apple strudel for dessert, which was also pretty good, but then the bill came.Total came to almost exactly 100, less the 20 coupon. This is cafe food, not gourmet, and a very casual atmosphere, definitely not even close to worth 100. Our server, Clarissa, did a decent job. Not overly attentive, but got the job done. But we definitely will NOT be going back. I'm not crazy about Hofbrauhaus either, but at least they have good beer and fun entertainment.",1
"Poor attention to glass both interior and exterior. n nAnd above all, I positively denounce being called ""boss "", ""hoss "", ""chief "", or whatever goofball nick name the ""service writers "" want to give me. Look sport, when I am spending money that keeps your stupid ass employed, give me the courtesy of sir, or better yet, say nothing at all before you call me ""boss man "" or something else equally stupid. n nLearning to not be socially inept is your first step to something that pays better than a car wash. n nGot it skippy?",1
So disappointing. Both the one in Tucson and the one in Phoenix. Their prices appear to be RETAIL rather than RESELL. Way overpriced. There are better stores in town.,1
"I had to restrain myself from writing this review right after eating here for dinner last night, because I was afraid my distended tummy and satisfied tastebuds would've influenced my review. n nWell. This place is great. Very good tapas, considering this is Urbana Champaign. A tad expensive a 76 bill for three , but that doesn't stop me from planning to make the rare excursion back. n nLast night, my sister, mom, and I headed down to V Picasso, with reservations at 6 PM. NO NEED FOR RESERVATIONS at that time, my god, there were like three tables filled. It's a very pretty place, all dark and sleek, with lighted candles on each table. There are two places to sit an actual dining area with plushy red booths and small tables, and then a sports bar like area, which unfortunately got filled with rowdy drunk college guys as the night went on. n nOur server, Audrey, was incredibly helpful with the menu and her suggestions for the dates and churros were wonderfully enjoyed . We ordered about 8 dishes, including spinach croquettes, the aforementioned bacon wrapped dates, grilled zucchini, blackened cod, tempura shrimp the specialty for the night , shrimp ceviche, green string beans, lavendar creme brulee, and creme filled mini churros. n nThe Bad green beans, tempura shrimp, and shrimp ceviche. The green beans were just.blah, with slivers of almonds. A waste of 5. The tempura shrimp was redeemed only because of the delicious red pepper aioli that I swear I would take a bath in, it was so good. The shrimp ceviche, oh, the ceviche. WHAT THE HECK? A weird amalgam of tomatoes and olive and roasted red peppers and jalapenos. blegh. No. Do not recommend. n nThe Oh So Good the dates, ooh the dates. and the spinach croquettes. the COD! The dates were stuffed with gorgonzola cheese and walnuts, and then wrapped in crispy, sweet bacon. I don't like gorgonzola blue cheese at all, but these I devoured these babies. I dreamed about those dates last night. Really. The spinach croquette oozed with cheese and wilted spinach, and they changed it a bit, so instead of two greasy cakes, out came out three crispy morsels. Yum. And, finally, blackened cod that was nestled on top of this tomato reduction that was slightly spicy. Mmm. I was never a fan of blackened fish, but it was deliciously crusted in spices. n nI need to go back and try the other tapas.",2
"Good place for drinks and a few bites, but not recommended for dinner. n nLoved the smokehouse margarita very smoky and spicy, not for those looking for a typical margarita. The avocado margarita was also great cooling and refreshing. n nFood is where things fell apart. The menu looks amazing we had a hard time picking what we wanted to order because the combinations all sounded so interesting. So we enlisted the help of our server who was extremely passionate about the duck empanada and malbec braised short ribs which were in our consideration set. n nThe duck lacked any real flavor or richness neither the foir gras nor the habanero came through. But the short ribs were honestly a disaster. The meat was incredibly dry we couldn't even imagine how something braised could be so dry, unless they make it once or twice a week and then reheat in the microwave. We barely ate half, and I typically will finish anything. n nGuac was fine, nothing special. Definitely not worth 12 in terms of either quality or quantity. Ambiance was nice, but not enough to balance out mediocre at best food. Unfortunate I was looking forward to this meal.",1
"Sehr freundlicher Service und leckeres, frisches Essen von einer w u00f6chentlich wechselnden Karte. Waren sicher nicht zum letzten Mal da.",2
"The Food is 5 star! Everything is flavorful and presented nicely. Tv's at every booth good for children . Only negative is staff can be slow and sparse. The Paneer Marsala is very rich but mild though not a problem just ask for more kick and they will gladly adjust. Restaurant is connect to. Hotel so I believe there is WIFI. Also the restaurant never seems more than 35 full, which is a plus for me due to children. Honestly it the best tasting Indian food I have tasted in the Valley so far . Everything is A La Cart.",2
"Am I allowed to give zero stars? This place is the rudest and we are in Pittsburgh. Asked the bartender what the best special mixed shot they had was and he looked at another bartender, looked back and said ""uhhhhh I dunno "" then walked away. Appalled to say the least, way to appeal to new customers",1
"I am a pretty harsh critic when it comes to food AND service combined to create an experience. I am giving Nosh Swig 4 stars this is a VERY good review from me!I I bought a groupon cause I love small bites and apps and nosh's. From the starter of popcorn in cute little metal tins to a wonderful sweet blond waitress who had personality and an eagerness to please that i really appreciated! n The number one thing you should order is the Chicken polish sausage on pretzel bread.AMAZING! The mushrooms were ok just eh, they were out of a few items, the mac and cheese was to die for and out of the hodge podge.the o rings and truffel tots were finished off completly! We didnt make it to dessert, but want to try the pb and j next time. n I am so thrilled with groupon for including this place, would never have known they exhisted. Hope they do more offers, either way, we WILL be back! GREAT atmosphere, good food, nice server. I am very happy ",2
"Food was good here. Presentation was great. All the food came in small plate portions. Kind of like tapas. Come here early so you don't get stuck in a huge line. n nThis place serves bone marrow, which I've never seen at any other vegas buffets I've been too. It was too bland for my taste but still worth a try. All the other food were good and flavorful. Dessert section was excellent n nDefinitely give this buffet a shot if you haven't been before, it will be a slightly different experience from the traditional vegas buffets.",2
"Cityscape is merely a developers tunnel visioned project once again in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Add it to the Arizona Center, Mercado, Collier Center, that were all touted to be the big missing piece in the downtown Phoenix retail development puzzle. Those projects have floundered and repeatedly tried to re incarnate themselves. Arizona Center is positively lush compared to this development. n nThe park that was razed to make room for this generic piece of downtown real estate and was supposedly going to be incorporated into the project has been converted to something called ""Patriot's Square "", and is nothing more than a cement pad surrounded by oodles of cement slab benches this is Phoenix people! that serves merely as an uninviting thoroughfare to get people into the project to spend money, and back out again. n nToo often these projects merely take business away from others downtown, because they are the newest, shiniest kid on the block. It's interesting to note that several big law firms one of which was across the street have moved to the office part of this complex recently. And why? Because this project was subsidized to the tune of over a 100 Million dollars in tax breaks, and the owners can now offer cheaper rent than their neighbors as a result! n nEntering this project from the rear, it's clear that south Phoenix is not even in the equation as you are greeted by a large, looming gray concrete facade that moons any neighbors to the south. As you approach the plaza from the west you are greeted by an unintentionally funny security sign referencing incontinence, rubber diapers, boils and cuts, which precedes your approach to even more concrete with 3 token slabs of grass a very weak nod to the City park that was there previously . Stores with names like Designer District West of Soho The Modern Bohemian, make it clear this project desperately wants to be hip. And yet the look of the place is extraordinarily dull. n nIt remains to be seen if people will expressly come downtown, pay to park, or want to hang out at a place that has so little charisma and is studded with many of the same types of businesses that can be found in the neighborhoods where they already reside. n n Any city park that was neglected the way the original Patriot's Square park was, will of course look ugly. After the City stopped watering the trees and plants and let them die, turned off the water fountains, turned off the decorative fountains, locked the bathrooms so no one could use them of course the park went to hell in a handbasket. No City does those things to a centrally located park without ulterior motives. The bottom line was this was valuable, prime real estate in the middle of downtown Phoenix.",1
This place is as generic as it gets. I could've made a better dinner with products from Walmart.,1
This was definitely different. I've never seen ice cream this way. Loved the toppings! The insane part is the ice cream stays freezing cold.,2
Very nice decor and horrible food. I had duck salad can't even chewed it was so hard and overcooked. nCalamari salad was ok but calamari was cold.,1
"Great food, but absolutely horrible service! It took us 2 1 2 hours to get our food! This kitchen must supply all the Phoenician convention business. Hard to believe that Jean George would tolerate his name being associated with this Resturant. I'm sure he doesn't know about how bad the kitchen's inability to get the food out is damaging his reputation or. He just doesn't care! Absolutely terrible !",1
"To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's nothing special. n nThe food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay. n nA friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for 10. And guess what? It tastes like a 10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was 10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better. n nAll in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for.",1
"I've never been treated so rudely and had worse service from a Starbucks than I've had at this one. The staff here have no interest in their customers and find it's more important to carry on conversations with each other than creating a positive customer experience. n nI already heard bad things about this Starbucks but decided to try it out. My first interaction with them was in the winter and I ordered a passion tea lemonade hot. I've ordered this drink at other Starbucks and one in henderson actually gave me the idea of making it hot one visit when I wasn't feeling well and had no issues. This time the barista told me ""we can't do that "" kindly explained to her that other Starbucks have done it they steam the lemonade she replied very rudely ""well we don't do that at this Starbucks it ruins our machine. "" I was completely caught off guard with her tone of voice and unwillingness to help. I placed my order for a different drink. My second encounter was a few months later, I thought I'd give it another chance. I went through the drive thru placed my order went to the window and the barista was leaning on the wall had a very lazy presence and was talking into the store to her other coworkers as I pulled up. She looked and me, told me my total and then continued her conversation with her coworkers. I handed her my phone to scan my card during this time she's still continuing her conversation. She hands me my drinks says ""thanks "" closes the window and immediately walks away. n nNeedless to say two bad experiences are two to many. I have my own stories my roommate has lived on this side of town longer than I have and she has even more. I will never go back to this Starbucks. They really have some shaping up to do within their staff. Good luck",1
My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat before we started out a day in Scottsdale and came across this place. The inside has some interesting decorations that are cool to look at and the window seats are great for people watching. n nOur server was very friendly and gave me a great recommendations on the steak sandwich. Great sandwich and an interesting take on it. It's kinda cheesy but I had a root beer to go along with my meal instead of a cocktail and I was very pleased with my choice. My girlfriend had a wrap which tasted fresh and tasty. Overall positive experience that I would recommend. We are not from the area but it looks like they have night time events that could please any type of audience.,2
"A bunch of scam artists.The same girl and another guy a while back ""forgot to give me change "" when paying with cash.Food is okay.But they are good at scamming drunk people out of a few dollars",1
"Monday night and I was already downtown for this Inside the Trenches thing and I was hungry. My friend suggested Ticoz and it was perfecto, unlike the weather that night. A storm was brewing when we pulled into the packed parking lot, so we decided to sit near the windows in the lounge area of the bar. n nWe started off with Sangria. He had the watermelon and I had the passion fruit. Both were delicious. The watermelon was made with blush wine and came with a big slice of watermelon. So, I guess you really need to like watermelon if you plan on ordering that. I preferred the passion fruit made with red wine. n nFor dinner I ordered a big ol' burrito covered in cheese and my friend got the tacos. Everything was great and let me tell you, that burrito was the biggest thing I've ever seen. Bring a hearty appetite. n nThe server was super friendly and talked me through all his favorites since I couldn't make up my mind. n nThe best part of the night was when a complete stranger offered us a piece of her birthday cake. Isn't that sweet? She shared with the entire bar. I guess looking back, you shouldn't take cake from strangers but I figured it was safe since the entire bar was eating it. n nI can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu, seriously I want to try everything. The lounge in the bar has a great atmosphere and we spent hours eating, drinking, and talking.",2
"Make sure you know there is a hotel service fee for each night that you stay of 14.55 per night per room. If you book through another website this is not always stated. Also, not always told to you by the front desk upon check in. I would not recommend this hotel due to unfriendly staff and lack of communication. Rooms were okay but not worth the price.",1
I really enjoyed the Neon Museum. Our tour guide was well informed and friendly and the signs are so cool! As others have mentioned there there is almost no shade and it gets very hot. They are starting evening tours soon so I'd love to go back and do it again.,2
"Where do I start. So the place was a wreck! Not clean at all, the people working there were not the best at what they did and were slow. We were over charged 0.83 cents. We noticed they rang up the wrong pasta and wrong size sandwich and we the customers corrected it before they started to make our food and then They brought out the wrong sandwich for me twice and the wrong size. The small order of six garlic knots only came with 5. Even though all of this we were determined to not let it ruin our night. Because we could tell they were trying hard. Then we saw this girl with a face tattoo taking an order over the phone and how she was just sassy and rolling her eyes on the phone. That was when we decided to write a review. We got a sandwich. Pasta, garlic knots and one small soda. Total was 38.93. We would not recommend going to this place. Spend your money elsewhere you will not feel happy after you eat here.",1
"Ambiance As basic as it gets. Two flat screens play Sri Lankan music videos. n nService Attentive, friendly. n nPrice 6 and up n nFood Best assortment of authentic Sri Lankan food in Montreal, including idlis, vadaas, string hoppers, pittu, and Indian standards such as thalis and curries. The dosas are to be highly recommended. The onion bhaji is fantastic. The portions are tremendous. n nSummary The food is as home cooked as it gets. It is not restaurant fare prepared for a western palate, but rather hearty food for the ex pat Sri Lankan community. One of Montreal's hidden treasures.",2
"It might just be that we didn't order the right stuff or that they have Americanized too much. My short impression is that the food was bland and pretty dull. My wife ordered the Tacitos and while these are usually bland by design, it's the dipping sauce that gives them life and the Avacado sauce was disappointing as an over whipped Avacado. My daughter at the age of two is an incredible fan of Mexican Rice and Beans and she wouldn't touch them here, she only ate the chips and salsa, which admittingly and disappointingly was the high life of the mean. I had the most order Pollo Fundido, the chicken while all white meat was extremely bland, the only thing that saved this dish was the jalapeno cheese sauce on top. It actually had life and would make a great Con Queso dip in it's own rights. I would like to see the meat livened up with a little jalapeno and salsa. Show me the food I would see when visiting friends having a Fiesta, I know it's there, let it out and show your full potential as a Mexican resturant.",1
"Food is okay really good smoothies, but it is expensive and the employees are rude and non personable. I don't know if they always give dirty looks for the sake of dirty looks, or if they are just PO'ed about something. Anyway, salad bar is decent, smoothies are good, everything is expensive.",1
"This place sucks. Never going back. The pedicure was just ok, nothing special. I got a gel polish manicure and she would be working on one hand and then go work on a manicure for somewhere else amd then come back and work on the other and this continued until she was done. I was getting irritated. Then she didn't want to paint my nails because they only had two lights and they were both being used so I had to wait more. I asked if her she could wax my eyebrows while we were waiting and she agreed but felt like it took her 20 mins to wax my eyebrows. She was sooo slow. Finally finished up but I was in there for over 2 hours and I will never go back.",1
"We had 75 in gift cards for numerous restaurants on the strip. We happened to be in the Paris hotel and were hungry and looked at the lunch menu, which looked appealling. We decied to try it. We ordered a beer and the french onion soup, which was outstanding! The outstanding part stopped there! We had to flag down our waiter for another drink and refills on water. We waited at least 45 minutes for our meal, which we ordered sauteed mushrooms, which came cold, a beef dip and strip steak with bernaise. The whole meal was cold and the steak was tough. Our server never checked on us and our LUNCH meal was 90! Luckily we had a 75 voucher! nPricey, terrible service and bad food!",1
"McMullen's isn't as authentic as a real Irish pub, but it is close. Also the food is pretty good, on that note I might add that the Irish Nachos are humorous and tasty. Furthermore for Vegas its prices are fairly decent. The interior of the bar restaurant is fairly nice, though they did put it on a little thick with quotes from Irish writers. That being said McMullen's isn't half bad and could be considered a diamond in the rough when it comes to Vegas.",2
Tried to make an appointment with a female doctor for my wife. Was told that as she had seen a doctor there before over 5 years ago their policy was she had to see the same doctor. Not good customer service.,1
"tacky? yes! but the whole of vegas is all about being tacky. but for the price i think its perfect. it's got everything you need and more. the service was good and was even upgraded to a nicer room, so i can't complain too much. their are better hotels for a little extra money but hey at the end of the day as long as its safe and clean then all you need the room for is to sleep in as most of the time you will be out partying along the strip.",2
"If you don't care about calories, Parma is the place to be for reasonably priced and delicious Italian food. I went with a few friends I had the linguini fruitti di mar seafood pasta in a red sauce , and my friends had the pork chops and veal parmigiano. The service was nothing short of perfection, because I altered my dish by asking for this and that, e.g., I want chili peppers, fresh basil, etc. What can I say? I'm demanding, and boy does Parma deliver! I don't remember the name of our waiter, because he was very attentive and jovial. n n My guests loved their dishes. The friend who ordered the pork chop was impressed with how large the pork chops were. It looked like it could feed a family of four, and he definitely licked his plate clean. For my dish, I enjoyed it, but I would have liked to see more fish in my fruitti di mare, fewer mussels than clams my dish was swimming in mussels , and more shrimp and calamari. n nSince I love seafood and always order seafood pasta wherever I go, I would say Parma's linguini fruitti di mare is worthy of 3.5 stars. It was definitely very good and tasty for the price, but for me, the service made my experience worthy of 5 stars. All in all, I'd definitely go back there again next time I'm in Vegas.maybe after I'm done dieting. lol",2
"The office is very clean and the staff is friendly. I went here for an oil change and they serviced my car right away we were lucky that they had an opening at the time we got there . I would recommend making an appointment to ensure you don't wait long. Oil change included full inspection and they will tell you what needs to ve fixed urgently and what can wait. I got the feeling that this place is honest and won't take advantage of people like me who doesn't knowuch about cars. n nWhen we were about to leave, we mentioned that one of our brake lights were out. The staff apologized for overlooking this in the inspection and fixed my brake lights for free! the search is over for a good, reliable, and honest car repair shop. I will be bringing my cars here from now on.",2
"Truly one of the great collegiate spots for Mex American cuisine! n nI love chipotle. I loved it more after watching their documentary on Netflix. If I ever forget to bring my lunch to school, I usually come here for their bowls with a tortilla on the side. For my bowls, I usually get chicken because it's the cheapest, but I've had the sofritas too, which are pretty tasty and cheap! . Love that they have brown rice options too now. n nI think this is a great location because you can call ahead and pick up your order, if you're in a rush. It's true, this place usually gets high influx around normal eating times 12p, 5p with all the array of interesting bodies Maryland Pkwy has to offer. One down side is that sometimes the staff are slow to clean up the tables, but it's a small issue for a reasonably priced, fresh, ""fast food "" go to for college students like myself ",2
"The only thing going for this restaurant is that if you are lucky enough to get a table facing the street view, you get to enjoy the street shows with the below average, flavor less meal, prepared in an iron chef restaurant. n nBatali, if you read yelp, which i doubt you do, take off your name from this restaurant. You may be making a neat pile of money but you are not doing yourself any favors. You lost a fan. n nWhile our server was nice, thats the only nice thing that I have got to say about this restaurant. nThe bread was cold, served without the customary olive oil. When we asked for some, we got hard butter! n nWe ordered mozzarella and anchovy fritti, which was like fried cheese sandwich, couldn't taste the anchovies at all. Batali, I can make a more flavorful fritti. n nfor main course we got the Grilled Lamb with nrice beans, tomato, arugula, which was very disappointing. The rice beans were dry, the lamb was blah. n nDon't waste your calories and money at this restaurant, any decent cook can turn out better dishes than what was served here.",1
"Went in around 6pm on a Monday night and was one of only two customers in the place. n nI was expecting that the staff would make it a point to be especially welcoming and helpful, but was disappointed in that nobody even noticed that I was at the counter until I cleared my throat to alert them to my presence. A bad start but I figured maybe they were still new and might be having an ""off "" day. n nOrdered a brisket sandwich.which was carefully and obviously portioned. Clearly, they were only as ""generous as they needed to be and not a tenth of an ounce more. Really put me off. Likewise, the side orders were carefully portioned with a level scoop into a paper cup. Sorry, but it didn't feel the least bit hospitable at all. n nThe moment of truth the food. Bun on which my sandwich was served was stale and fell apart as I ate the sandwich, turning it into a kinfe and fork meal as it disintegrated. Meat was OK.not bad, but certainly one would not need to look far to find a superior meal. The mashed potatoes were OK and the beans were nothing special either. Portions were adequate but neither overly large or small. n nDuring the meal, the owner and the manager seemed to be instructing a couple of unhelpful and marginally competent teeneagers who seemed uninterested in their jobs during my interaction with them. On my trip through the line, which took eight minutes even though I was the only customer in the line, and one of only two in the restaurant the employees did not work together to expedite my order. n nSorry to say, they are going to have to make a fairly big turnaround in their service time, their employee attitudes, their obvious portion control, and the freshness of their buns. n n I'll probably give it one more try, hoping that my experience is the result of the fact that the restaurant is still new and they don't have their operation smoothed out yet. My prediction is that in two month's time, the restaurant will be a success or will be padlocked with a ""For Rent "" sign in the window. This restaurant has a lot of potential but will be quickly out of business if it doesn't shape up.",1
"Yum! n nMy boyfriend was very sweet to take me here during a dinner break while we were at The Golden Nugget. We don't usually go to downtown LV, but it's actually pretty cool! n nAnyway. this steakhouse is great! We ordered n nCrabcake appetizer Yumm, it's basically all crab meat and no filler. Totally great. The crab pieces are gigantic and plump. It comes with a little sauce drizzled on the top with a few chopped tomatoes. Delicious! I wish I could eat some right now. This was probably the best thing I ate. n nFilet Mignon Perfectly cooked medium rare. They're great cuz they verify what medium rare means to them, so that no one gets something they weren't expecting. n nAustralian Lobster Tail Mmm. So many times I have overcooked lobster and it just tastes so gross. But this was so good. Dipped in butter. yumM! I forgot prepared, but it doesn't matter! n nAu Gratin Potatoes Just cheesy potatoes. I couldn't stop eating it. So good! The potatoes are chopped into little pieces rather than sliced and the cheese is perfectly burnt just a little on top. n nWe also ordered the most amazing red wine, per recommendation of the waiter. Wow it was so good. It was the first time that I actually saved the cork. Unfortunately, I can't remember what it was perhaps I drank too much! n nWe didn't have time for dessert, but I'm sure it would have been good Or if you're here you can skip dessert and then go across the street and get some deep fried oreos to end your night!

I go to vegas a few times a year but I didn't like the customer service here seems like they think they were doing me a favor but letting me stay here. Didn't feel welcome felt more like a customer than a guest. If you've worked in the service industry before you will understand what I mean.,1
"I usually stay away from fast food, but I happened to be working in the area and was too lazy to drive further away for lunch. n nUpon entry there was a BK employee on break eating BK food, always an encouraging sign when employees eat company food. Customer service was friendly, unfortunately that was about all that was good. 7.80 on two chicken sandwiches plus value onion rings. Food was below average although not terrible.

"I think it's time for a reality check here the Palms sucks, and the Real World season everyone references when they're talking about the hotel aired about 5 years ago. n nWhy should you avoid the Palms? Here are some reasons n n1. The crowd Um, it's not where ""beautiful people "" congregate in Las Vegas. That distinction goes either to the Hard Rock or the Bellagio. In fact, the majority of the gambling dollars at the Palms come from Las Vegas locals, and I don't mean the kind of LV locals who dance at Spearmint Rhino. No, I'm talking about 70 year old retirees who have taken up second careers as slot jockeys. At any given point before midnight, half the people in the Palms have grandchildren. And the other half of the people aren't that great. n n2. The food I've seen some other people here point to the fact that the Palms has a food court as evidence of it's culinary accomplishments. Um, it's freakin' Las Vegas. You can do slightly better for a meal than McDonalds. All the high end restaurants in the Palms are overpriced and overhyped. N9ne? Yeah, it's okay, but Fix in the Bellagio has better food and better looking people. Guaradino's is a poor man's version in food quality, not prices of Diego in MGM Grand. And Nove? If you really want Italian, try Wynn they have some much better places there. n n3. The nightlife I'm sure Rain and Ghostbar were great when Trishelle and the rest of the Real World crew hung out there. Unfortunately, time rarely stands still, which goes double in clubland and triple in Vegas. In past five or so years, places like Tao, Pure and Jet have opened. So who goes to Rain and Ghostbar today? 21 year old guys who wear sleeveless t shirts. And lots of them. I know this because I once had a job reviewing nightclubs in Las Vegas, and I remember walking into Rain and thinking I'd accidentally ended up on the Jersey Shore. Um, not that there's anything wrong with that. Sadly, the new places in tower 2 Moon, The Playboy Club aren't special. n n4. The hotel Not to sound like a design snob, but the Palms just feels cheap compared to all the Strip places. The wooden flooring was an idea that seemed great on a designer's computer, but in real life just gets destroyed from all the foot traffic. The casino chips feel cheap compared to what's used elsewhere in the city. And the music is much better at the Hard Rock. n nIn short, skip the Palms and head for the Hard Rock or the Bellagio.",1
Food is great ! Mimosas and french toast!? Yes please! Staff is friendly the place has a pretty Laid back vibe which I like very much ,2
"For a Wednesday night, which is a slow night, the service was just ok. It took a long time to get everything. I would only come to this place to drink.

There were 2 2 tops when we were there and about 7 people sitting at the bar. n nFood Wings and Fries from Appetizer menu and A Fat Tire Beer . nThe wings were breaded and we asked for medium bc server said they were hot. Which they were not. We added a side of Ranch and Hot Sauce to make them more spicey. They seemed like they were just re heated or even pre made. I am a wing girl and live for them.was not impressed at all. The only good thing is they were not small and had more meat on them then most places. n nService Forget servers name, its all women staff, she was blond with long hair. She was really nice, sweet, good looking. It took us 10 min after ordering our waters to get them. I ordered my beer after we ordered the water and wings and it came out with my meal. You can see all the food up when its ready and our meal sat there for a good 10 minutes who is timing anyways . She did apologize for taking so long bc she was ""cleaning "" at 10pm when the bar closes at 2ish and the happy hour starts at midnight. Must have been pretty dirty. n nOverall I would come with friends if I was staying in the neighborhood and just drinking. I would most likely sit at the bar too, if there is an open spot. I am not knocking this place completley, I saw they have breakfast on Sat and Sundays so they can possibly redeem themselves. n nSince the weather is nice I want to be able to bring the dogs and sit on the patio as well.

The problem was he wasn't really any good at any of it so it was just some sort of lame delay while he tried to serve people drinks. He noted my presence and must have realized I was out of my element. Instead of trying to make me feel welcome, he helped everyone in the section, then everyone who came after me making another round of the section and then finally turned to me. I had to place my order 3 times before frosted tips in a too tight shirt could hear me, and instead of giving me a normal sized cocktail he grabbed some goldfish bowl with a glass stem on it and decided to make it up to me by making me essentially 3 drinks in one glass and charging me for my trouble. What a prince. n nI made my way back to our table only to find that while I'd been gone my girl had been hit on by a random guy, a random girl and a bouncer. Classy. The highlight of the evening was getting to meet the U of A Mascot in his street clothes. A really nice guy, with a great attitude despite the fact that he had apparently gotten punched in the face earlier in the evening during the ASU UofA football game. Seriously, he was gracious about the ASU win and seemed really happy to have any Arizona teams go to Bowl games. I wish there were more people like him out there. n nWe ended up leaving early because of additional drama with the patrons of this fine establishment and one of my friends. I would be happy to never go here again.",1
"I don't get all the harsh things people are raggin' on the Strat for. For 35 night around 60 on weekends , the accommodations were spectacular. Don't expect anything too lavish it's a simple hotel, but mostly clean, spacious and modern. If I was staying in this level of hotel in Boston, I'd be paying around 150 200, not 35. This hotel is value, value, value. n nAlthough cabs to the Strip were a bit costly, everything else was great. Unlimited access to the top of the tower resort fee of 7.50 per day, well worth it , good pool scene with cornhole boards and waitresses in bikinis , a built in shopping mall and cheap food options were all convenient. We played table blackjack for 5, big wheel spins for 2 and roulette for 5 in the casino. For the mornings where I had too much Vegas the night before, room service was pricey but solid. Buffet was kind of gross, if you're going to do the buffets do it a higher tier hotel. n nOverall we liked staying here. I could definitely see doing it again. For the price you can't go wrong.",2

"We went there for dinner. It is good that they close at midnight as a lot of time we have dinner after 10pm but don't wanna eat in China Town. We like the environment of the restaurant, the food, and the service. The price is acceptable, cheaper than the Chinese restaurants in other hotels on the strip. n nWe ordered a Mongolian beef, beef fried noodle and sauteed baby bak choy. They all tasted great. The Mongolian beef is really better than any other Mongolian beef I had tasted else where. The seasoning profile of this one has more depth than those using too much black pepper, garlic and soya sauce. The Mongolian beef here is really outstanding, it tasted so good without having anything overpowering, well balanced. n nThe sauteed baby bak choy is well done, the veggie is just right, not under or overcooked. It is not garlicy as we asked for simple sauteed, so it is simply refreshing. The baby bak choy is fresh, and good quality, they are well cleaned too so no sandy taste when chewing on them. They smartly cut the baby bak choy into quarters vertically so they could be thoroughly cleaned. n nThe beef fried noodle is good, just no surprise, which is expected. I like that they don't use the very thin yellow noodle. n nWe were offered a small complimentary spicy veggie plate as appetizer. It smelled really good but too spicy for us that we kept coughing. If you can handle picy, you will like it. n nI like Chinese food having the real Chinese flavor, meaning that I always compared it with what I had tasted when I was in northern China for an exchange program. I like food having depth but not overpowering by only black pepper or garlic That means I don't like americanized Chinese food. So far, with the 3 dishes that I tried, they tasted Chinese without Americanization. There was also no MSG. I hate MSG. I always think that only those chefs who can't cook well need to use MSG. So big kudo for here not using any. I hope they won't change on this aspect in the future. I can't speak for other dishes yet, but will update in the future after I tried something new there. nWe finished everything we ordered and had a happily filled stomachs at the end. We will come back to try other dishes for sure!",2
"Oh garlic naan! How I love you! n nThis place has legit naan! We came to the lunch buffet, the price went up from 9.99 to 10.99, but you get a free mango lassi with Yelp check in. n nBeing that I'm a weirdo and I don't try everything, this was momentous for me. The inside was really dimly lit and clean clean. The buffet line was clean and the food didn't look hella old. It actually looked and smelled appetizing. n nMy person favorites were Tandoori chicken, chicken curry and butter chicken that's what my coworker Safi said it was called I was super impressed by everything! The customer service was great the food was delicious and hot. For desert we had Gajar Ka Halwaw, my coworker loves this stuff! n nWe will be back! nYay!",2
"Im not sure what all the buzz is all about when it comes to this place. I've been here a few times now. The flavors are ""ok "", nothing special. I love my chicken wings, these just aren't all that great. Their okay if you just want to get by and get your wing fix.",1
"1. Gets five stars for doing everything right n2. We bumbled into the place, just looking for a quick bite before the Absinthe circus show, right outside the entrance of Caesar's Palace.

"Went here for a haircut today, hair dresser did a great job, Very friendly staff. n nHowever, when it came time to pay for my cut, I was informed that I could only pay for my haircut with my card, but my tip had to be left in cash. Apparently, their terminal has a tip feature that can be turned on, but the management of the business refuses to do so. n nI was recommended to use the ATM outside to take out a cash advance which would cost me extra bank fees since the ATM is not with my bank, not to mention the higher rate I would have to pay on a cash advance transaction vs. a sale. n nSuffice to say, this is a violation of MasterCard operating rules and I have filed a complaint with MasterCard. If a business advertises MC acceptance and I present one for payment, you have to accept it for the full payment including tip , end of story. n nI work in the Credit Card industry and it's very unusual for me to carry cash on me at all and was embarrassed to have to leave without tipping my hairdresser for a job well done. I will now have to return when I have cash on hand another inconvenience to me in order to pay out the tip he deserved. n nDebit and Credit cards are more secure, plain and simple and I shouldn't be forced to use cash at a business if they advertise the fact that they accept one of the cards in my wallet. n nI will not be returning to this establishment for this reason it's a shame since I'd otherwise be more than happy to give business to the great people who work there.",1
"I came here looking for the usual California Burrito and some Jamaica. I did not get either. I went through drive thru and the person taking my order didnt understand my English, so I had to come to the window to ask about their menu. I could barely understand her English, so I just opted for some quesadilla. It was okay and I cant compare it to the usual Mexican food I have at Vaqueros on 19th and Southern. The food was just okay and I was disappointed mostly because I did not have someone who spoke clear English customer service was okay otherwise.",1
"We go to 40 40 every time we visit Vegas. We usually have a pretty good time. Friday nights are cool if you want a nice atmosphere with it being sort of empty. You can chill with friends and sit anywhere you want. So, when we went this past Saturday, we decided to take it up a notch and get bottle service. Bad mistake. Don't do it. It's a scam. Here are the details n nWhen I made the deal for the table, I was told that I would receive two bottles of champagne, strawberries, and a table large enough to fit the six people in my party for 400. I received two bottles, but the strawberries were two that were cut into a lot of pieces. The table didn't fit my party. We were made to squeeze on a sectional designed to fit two people. So we had to squeeze 3 people on the couch and the other three had to sit on foot stools. They then presented a 533 bill. n nI refused to sign the credit card statement because I was overcharged. They threatened to call police if I didn't sign. Someone was assigned to ""watch me "" for almost 2 hours before the manager took the time to talk to me. He told me that the best he could do was charge me 450. Since there six people in my party, I decided to sign so we could leave. It was almost 5 am at that point. n nI very calmly attempted to inform them that we were not satisfied with our accommodations and that we were being over charged. Since it was in a club, I had a hard time hearing them. I asked if I could talk to him outside and he refused to talk to me outside of the club. Their initial response was to threaten to call police on me and that I would have to wait 3 hours to wait for them to get there. n nFrom what I learned from talking to three different club security employees that the 40 40 club scams people to get them into the club and getting their credit cards, then overcharges them at the end of the night because they think people will be too drunk to notice. They were very rude and weren't willing to acknowledge or resolve the dispute.",1
"Does anyone remember that scene from ""The Simpson's Movie "" where Ned Flanders makes that super sexy hot chocolate and gives it to Bart? Well guess what y'all? I had that super sexy hot chocolate! The frozen version of it! I've been wanting to try this place forever. I went in New York awhile back, but the nearly 3 hour wait caused me to leave. So, I tried it in Las Vegas! Situated on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace, it's a great location. Excellent people watching opportunities. We had dinner elsewhere, so we only opted for dessert here. They are pretty pricey, but the servings are massive. More than enough to share. We sat at the bar, the server was friendly and poured us glasses of iced water as soon as we sat down. My husband and I decided to share the frrozen hot chocolate, 16 and our friend got the banana split. The server told him that he should probably get the smaller size of the banana split, since the one he opted for was massive. He was right! When he got the small size, it was still the biggest banana split ever. Everything was incredibly delicious. n nThe only reason I'm docking a star is because our friends wanted coffee, but were told they would need to go inside themselves and order coffee as he can't make it in that area. So, they went inside and were told by the employee inside that the server should have actually gone in and ordered it for them. Hmm. Also, about halfway through our visit, there was suddenly an odd smell at the outside area. The place is right on the strip so it could have been coming from there, but regardless.it was kind of gross, and I'm glad we were pretty much done by the time it appeared.",2
"just awful, listening to their sales pitch over and over by telemarketers felt more like I was dealing with AT T than an actual school. And it took forever to get them to tell me how much the school costs, important to know for most people. Anyway this is not a real school.",1
"Frustration. n nThis will be a hard review to write, because it comes on the heels of a tragedy. Most of us have heard by now of the tragic fall by the performer in the recent performance of KA, this, should not be ignored or taken lightly. It is a sad thing and my prayers go out to the family of the performer including her performance family. n nWith that being said, something else needs to be said. I had long put off seeing KA on my Vegas trips in deference to other Cirque shows.Love, O, Zarkana, Mystere, etc. n nKA was always that show I denied because I wanted to leave myself KA, sort of like leaving that last bite on the plate of your favorite ingredients. You're saving it for last because you know it will be the best. n nBut the accident apparently changed everything. In lieu of what happened, Cirque changed the entire finale of their show from a high flying sword fight to a convoluted marriage ceremony featuring some truly horrible facial acting. n nI wouldn't care about any of this had this been announced or stated in any way whatsoever when I was purchasing my expensive tickets. You see, I purposefully asked no only my concierge but also numerous representatives that I spoke with about whether the show had changed or not and they assured me that no, the running time was still the same. n nWhat they failed to mention was that indeed, the entire finale had changed, and that, a story line that is building you up to something remarkable is no more. n nIf you needed to change your story because the show is too dangerous, I get it, fine, I have no qualms with changing the ways things are done because of the risk to the performers. But when your entire reputation is built upon talk of a finale's to top all finale's, and when you promptly delete this from your program without telling the people who are buying the tickets, you are pulling off an elaborate trick. n nIndeed, the show is devoid of stunts with the finale gone.the best one that Cirque pulls off with the current version of the show is the high flying BAIT AND SWITCH which is exactly what happened on our recent visit. People all around us in front and back sort of just looked at each other when the show ended as if to say. ""Was that it? "" n nYep. That's it. Honesty will save your business.not extended amounts of Buffoonery by your ice fishermen. n nStay away from this show until they can figure out how to salvage what once was.or, LOWER YOUR PRICES TO PROPERLY REPRESENT the new show you are staging.",1
"This ""company "" hired me as a second shooter for a wedding in August of this year before you ask, I sent the photos I took to Adam Brooks, per our contract . As you can guess, I have not gotten paid. n nIn the weeks following the wedding , I was able to reach Adam a couple of times. Each time he promised to pay me by a certain day, which came and went without his promise being kept. Naturally, I began to get concerned but the fact that he sent, signed and had me sign a contract made me think that there was no way he would skip out on paying me. n nMeanwhile, my mother invited my fiance and I to attend a bridal expo and who did we find there? You guessed it. n nWhen I approached him and introduced myself, he didn't seem to have a clue that I was one of the photographers he hired I had never actually met him in person . After I refreshed his memory I politely, but sternly, demanded to know when payment was going to be made. He gave some excuse about being busy shooting weddings and that he would pay me by a certain day, the following week. After that day came and went, I realized he was never intending on paying me at all. n nHaving few options, I sent a demand letter to his business address. It has, since, been returned in the mail. Legal action is to follow. n nNot only is he not giving couples their photos but he isn't paying the photographers he is hiring to fill in for his absence. It makes me wonder if he is even a photographer, at all, or if he just uses other photographers' photos for his website. What's even more sickening is that he is going to bridal expos and posting deals online to gain more business. The fact that he could look me in the face and lie without hesitating disgusts me. n nThough I am naturally incensed about not having been paid for working an eight hour day on my feet in the heat and spending money on additional equipment figuring I was making that money back , it infuriates me more that he is stealing such a special day from so many couples. n nMy advice to everyone who has been burned by this con artist is to take legal action immediately! To people who are looking to hire a wedding photographer, please do thorough research before spending your money.",1
"We had a small reception of about 25 people here on June 26th,2011. Our servers were great, they were on top of drink refills and were very nice! We preordered our food but ended up having 2 unexpected guests and they were very accomidating and quick to get their meals in as well. The food was great. We had the pot roast, the champaine chicken, and the prime rib. We also had baked potatoes and the salad room for everyone. They allowed us to bring in our own cupcakes which was VERY nice. Alot of the places we looked at wouldn't allow that. Everything went very smooth and we were overall very happy with everything. The only issue we had was at the very beginig when we were looking into the place is we couldn't get any of the banquet coordinators to return our calls. I was ready to cancel at one point and a manager ended up calling me back and was very apologetic and we didn't ever have that issue again. It was very affordable compared to alot of the other places we looked at and with the salad room you couldn't get the amount of food for the price anywhere. We also had kids and they were willing to do smaller meals for them if we needed. All around a very good experience! It's perfect for a smaller reception or dinner!",2

My favorite Chinese place in AZ. It took me five years but I found my cheap take out Chinese restaurant! My son and I order from here regularly and it just seems to get better and better. We like the green pepper beef and their crab puffs are good. Their appetizer mix is good also. Try the spring rolls with their real hot mustard which you have to request. Very good!,2
"I have to say that I expected a lot more for a 5 star in Vegas. The others on the strip put this place to shame. The steakhouse was great, but that was about it. Their 24 hour cafe was a huge disappointment with only premade meals that they heat up. Even with my discounted VIP rate, I will probably stay elsewhere.",1
"My husband and I went to NOCA for my birthday dinner on a Wednesday night. We had heard really great things about it, and we were happy with our overall experience. Here's how it was. n nFirst the Pros nThe food and drinks were fantastic! Seriously, delicious. I had the Death's Door cocktail and my husband tried the Nocarita. Both were awesome. The Death's Door was a gin based drink and I am not a fan of gin that was perfectly balanced with just the right sweetness and alcohol y goodness. YUM! My husband's Nocarita was also quite tasty. I preferred my Death's Door, but that is a matter of personal taste I think. n nOur amuse bouche that night was a chilled pumpkin soup with hazelnut mascarpone served in a cute little espresso cup. It made the perfect first impression of what was to come. It was so flavorful, I could have had a gallon of it and been a happy lady. They should put that soup as a regular menu item, because I would go back to NOCA just for that! n nFor apps, my husband had the Simple Salad that was perfectly dressed and had a thoughtful variety of ingredients that elevated the ubiquitous green salad to something unique. I had the Bacon Chowder soup with Mussels that both tasted and smelled delicious. So, so, so good! Some really nice ladies at the table next to us even commented on how good my soup smelled. n nFor our main courses, I had the famous Lobsta Roll with Duck Fat Fries. Oh my! It lived up to the hype. My sandwich was comprised of big chunks of lobster dressed in a decadent creamy sauce, balanced with a slightly tangy corn and red pepper relish that perfectly complimented the lobster ""salad "". It was all nestled in a buttery toasty roll, with the fries and a dipping aioli sauce on the side. The portion was perfect and satisfying. Really, I can't say enough good things about my sandwich. nMy husband had the Rotelle with sausage and Tuscan kale. Again, it was delicious. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sausage and kale were a perfect compliment. Sausage can sometimes be overpowering, but this wasn't at all. It was mild and flavorful at the same time. The pasta sauce was indescribably good. It was buttery and savory, and did not over saturate the pasta. It was as perfect as a restaurant pasta dish can get! n nFor dessert, my husband had the donuts with three sweet dipping sauces, which were good. I had the Nocabar, which I preferred to the donuts. It was just the right size and tasted like a grown up version of a Twix bar on steroids. The Nocabar was the perfect ending to my birthday meal and did not disappoint. The grape flavored cotton candy was fun and a nice touch. We had commercially bought and packaged chocolate mints for our parting ""gift "". I think they ran out of the cellophane bagged house made cookies that I saw people leaving with at the beginning of our meal. n nOkay, now the Cons. n nThe service was not great. It was okay, at best. When we walked in there was not a host or hostess to greet us. Instead, we stood awkwardly at the door for a good 5 10 minutes waiting to be recognized. They were not that busy as it was a Wednesday night, which made it all the more frustrating. When we finally did get greeted and seated, there was no apology for the wait we did have a reservation . Our server was nice, but not too attentive. She seemed bored. The course timing was paced appropriately and the bus boy did keep our water glasses filled. Overall, we were certainly not impressed with the service. I think NOCA needs to work on training their wait staff. n nThe prices were high and did not match the level of service we received. I don't mind paying for a quality restaurant experience, but based on my experience at NOCA the service made our visit less than what it could've been.especially when we got the final bill. IMO, if you are going to charge the prices that were featured at NOCA both the service and the food needs to sing. In this case, the food was worthy but the service was not. n nOverall, I would go back to NOCA for the food. If they stepped up their service, then NOCA would become one of my favorite spots. I asked my husband to rate our NOCA experience before writing this review and I think his description was perfect. He said, ""The food was 4.5 rating out of 5.the service was a 3 out of 5 at best. "" n n As it stands, I have other places that I would want to check out before going back to NOCA places that have both their food AND service dialed in. However, I think that if you haven't been to NOCA before it's worth a visit to check out the amazing food for yourself.",2
"Walking in the place has a very relaxed vibe and beware the chairs are heavier than they look. Ha n nOur waiter recommended the mango margarita which has the perfect hint of spice. I took him up on it and was not sorry. We ordered the chips and salsa, fried wontons, several tacos and a Caesar salad. The first thing that came out was our tacos, random. n nHowever, they were delicious! If you're not too hungry go that route. The salsa is a chipotle style so it was a nice contrast. They add a spice to the chips that rocks. The wontons are not crazy deep fried and they come with a nice sauce. I didn't eat the salad but my mate said it was the best he's had in awhile, I'll take his word for it. n nIt was a casual easy going experience and I definitely recommend trying it!",2
"My family has been taking our cars here since the 1990s. I live in Chandler and still drive all the way in to Tempe because there is no other auto place I trust. They have always been fair, honest, and very reasonable. n nAs a female, I know most auto repair shops can, and do, take advantage of female customers. Not at Tempe Auto Repair. No matter where you live in the valley, it is worth the trip to bring your car here because you will have peace of mind knowing they are taking good care of your car and will always treat you right!",2
"Blech. I expected so much more from Wicked Spoon based on reviews and recommendations from friends, and left disappointed. n nOne upside the service was great, and our server was attentive and friendly. n nNow the downsides for one of the supposed ""top tier "" buffets in Vegas, the lack of selection was surprising. Yes, there are crab legs, but you can find those at any buffet in Vegas nowadays. Yes, there was bone marrow the thing I was looking most forward to! but for each bone you could get maybe a quarter teaspoon of marrow. And yes, the ice cream was delicious, but I was too busy scraping the remnants of the stalest macaron that I've ever eaten off the roof of my mouth to enjoy it much. n nI imagine that the appeal of Wicked Spoon lies in how they've covered their bases by including all of the ""fan favourites "" of the Vegas buffets the aforementioned crab legs, fried chicken in cute baskets, a carving station, mac and cheese, etc. So, if you've never tried any other buffet in Vegas, you will probably be satisfied. However, once you try any other buffet, you'll realize that it's missing a lot of things that might not be as novel or cute, but are nonetheless key to a good buffet veggies cooked or raw , fruit of any kind , and international cuisine selections beyond a few types of sushi and some nachos and salsa. Not to mention that we were told that the fresh pasta station only had cream sauce, the soup of the day had run out, and instructed to use taco shells as nacho chips as they had also run out of those mind you, the buffet was not busy when we went either . n nAnd the macaron! That hideous macaron! It had the taste and consistency of a mint that I had left in my purse for months and forgotten about. n nFor the regular 39 person for dinner, this was already not worth your money or time. For the 47 person ""holiday "" pricing, this was inexcusable. Do yourself a favour and head to the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars instead.",1
"DO NOT GO TO THIS CAR WASH! n nI took my car to have it detailed and a stain removed from the front seat. Not only were they unable to remove the stain, but they ripped the stitching from the seat! I tried to get it reconciled but the manager BART was unable to do so. I submitted to the Better Business Bureau with no response. I will now be taking them to small claims court to be reimbursed to have my car seat fixed 175. n nBEWARE!",1
Went in Sunday because my regular place was swamped. Thought this would be a good choice because closer to home. Went and they were not very busy should have been a clue and only had a pedicure. Worst one I have ever had. Polish on one toe was coming off with 3 hours. Ill wait for my old salon to have an opening next time. Tech seemed bothered by having to do a pedicure while soccer was on.,1

"Ok hate to give bad review but I feel travelers need to know. nI didn't eat here because already eaten, I'm anout to board in a red eye flight. nI ask for a glass of Pinot Noir, you can chose between 6oz, 9oz or the bottle. nSince I'll have a long flight I asked for a 9oz, listed for 19.50, not cheap and a small bottle of sparkling water. nWhen the glass arrived I noticed immediately that it was not 9oz, I sell fragrances and 9pz is more than 250ml, more than a quarter of a liter. nI thought they made a mistake but after tasting the wine I was happy they did because I've rarely tasted such cheap, acid, disgusting wine. That type of wine that takes 30 min to finish a glass because you can barely swallow it. nWell the check arrived for over 26.00, ONE glass of wine and a small bottle of water . nI left 4.00 tip because I always feel bad for waiters so I ended up to pay 30.52 for a glass of cheap disgusting wine and a small bottle of water. nIs there anything else that I can say? nYes there is there was also a light that was keeping getting on and off, perfect to enhance the robery armosphere. nI mean, does it take so much to make a Customer happy? A glass of wine and a bottle of water and still you can't make it? nTERRIBLE",1
"Delicious! I love nachos and this was the first time I've had the pulled pork variety and it was plentiful and delicious. After salting the guac, it was great fresh, rich, creamy and very flavorful.

"For the price I paid, this hotel was great. I booked a night here because I had a late flight in and I didn't really want to pay money for a night when I only spend a couple hours in the place. n nThe room was decent. I was expecting a trashy room that I wouldn't want to touch, but it was surprisingly better than that. The bed was pretty comfortable, and the tv had more channels than some of the other hotels I stayed at in Vegas. The front desk staff was also very friendly and accommodating. n nThis is within walking distance to some of the bigger and better casinos and hotels, like MGM Grand and New York, New York. It's also close to the Hooters casino, if you're into that. n nI didn't use the pool, but I hear it's nice. n nTwo complaints The hot water ran out while I was using the shower. I turned the water off and after a few minutes I was able to continue using the shower as normal. Also, no hair dryer.",2
"The atmosphere in this place is quite nice, very low lighting. It seems great for big family events, with a number of big private rooms. It's great because you have a perfect view of the lights and hustle of the Las Vegas Strip. I ordered to go but had a glass of wine while I waited for my food to finish. The servers seemed really nice for the most part, although I didn't get the full service since I was ordering to go. n nI ordered the shrimp fra diavolo lighter version with a side casear salad. The food was packed very nicely and thoroughly saran wrapped to keep from spilling. The salad was OK. Nothing too extravagant. The pasta was a nice portion, perfect to get full off of and then have leftovers for another meal. Also, they were very generous with the shrimp. Sadly, some of the shrimp tasted a little undercooked. I wasn't sure but the next morning when I was sick it was confirmed! Definitely may think twice before ordering seafood here!",1
"The customer service was so extraordinary, I am updating my review to reflect my experience. Both the owners responded to me. Whether they do or not is not personal for me it's business. And they both care for their customers and their business. nI got the Green Wellness Smoothie tastes good AND I get my vegeys and fruits. Even my carnivorous buddy's getting a smoothie here. I love the concept. And the staff is friendly and helpful. nI'll be back.",2
"We used to come here at least once a month, was fantastic. At this point we wont return again. Slow service, mediocre food a manager who looks shell shocked. Sorry Buca, you've lost us forever.",1
"Dr. Robertson listens to ""mother's instinct "" and he works with me to ensure great health for my 2 year old and 8 year old. I switched my pediatrician of 6 years to go to him and I am so mad at myself for not doing it 6 years earlier!",2
"What happened? A couple of years ago this was one of the best buffets on the strip? Now, you still have the same old line, the same old price, but the food is crap! There is hardly any seafood, and what they do have is mediocre. The rest of the ""french "" food doesn't even come close to living up to it's billing. You know what's sad? I remember the desserts being so good that I stuffed myself with them even though I was way past my limit. Now? Let's just say they aren't far from Hometown Old Country Buffet's quality. It may be worth it if they charged 1 3 of their dinner price, but c'mon now! I don't know what recent yelpers think is good food, but this is not it. Spend you elsewhere!",1
"This place USED to be good. We went there yesterday afternoon and everything was cold and tasted stale. To make our experience even better my husband had to get his own refill since our waiter never bothered to check if we needed any and when we asked for more salsa when our food came our waiter said he'd get it for us, a little while later still no salsa so my husband got up to look for our waiter to ask him for it and he said ""in a minute I'm really busy "".WOW! I wouldn't be so irked if it were a packed restaurant but there was seriously only 1 other table there and I counted at least 4 if not 5 people working there.1 of them could've bothered to check to make sure if we had drinks and or chips and salsa but obviously that was expecting way too much. Like I said they used to be good but the past few times I've been there their quality has been going down and this last experience was the last straw. Of course they are also very pricey.10.50 for 2 tacos beans and rice and the tacos are SMALL. I never thought Don Pedros which is 10 minutes away was that great but unfortunately Don Pedros is now better than this place ",1
"I have to agree with Patrick here that this place has a great assortment of salads. Usually I would never think to order a salad, but after a non impressive crab cake sandwich, I think next time I will try what my mother ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Salad. It was absolutely phenomenal. It definitely made the meal for all of us n nThe lettuce wraps were passable but nothing special, and my mother's Bisque soup was complete broth it was terribly watered down. When she said something to our waiter, he did not even offer a reason or a suggestion to get her another soup. He just said, ""I will take that off your bill and tell the manager. "" Well, the manager never came over to apologize or give a reason for the watery soup. What really bummed me out was that the soup was what my mother had been bragging about and what she had been so excited for me to try. Maybe we will have to try again someday.",1
"it was just okay and pricey, to me nothing specail",1
"Went this past November 18th for our anniversary. The food was great. The service Pabo was awesome. Thank you, Pabo, your customer service is impeccable and speedy, sir.",2
The food is excellent and the people there are super nice.,2
"A Modern Mexican restaurant with an upscale atmosphere I like it. n nThree of us had the privilege of dining here last Saturday. The drinks, the service, and the unusual food were all outstanding. The prices are very fair as well. n nGreat location with several other ""walking distance "" choices if they are too busy J Alexander's, Fogo De Chow, El Torito, Flemmings, Quilted Bear . Close to Old Town for nightlife too. n nGood luck Blanco!",2
Was a quite evening in tempe! Excellent food and service!,2
"I've been a Marriott member for years. I wanted a hotel near my father in laws house for Thanksgiving. The hotel staff is pleasant, but the facility is run down. There are torn, frayed, and stained carpets in the hallways. The ice machines, I kid you not sound like jet engines. The elevator has a level of grime going around the base of the walls. And the worst is this horrid funky, damp smell in the corridors on the first and second floor.",1
"I got their Almost Famous Cheese Stake pretzel and three plain ones. I think their website is wrong, I got charged a 1 extra for something, I'm assuming it's for the cheese stake pocket. But later my husband told me that if I buy more than three plain pretzels they do a discount. nNow I feel cheated. No one likes to be cheated. I don't care about the extra dollar, but the first impression I got from this place is not a good one. I don't see me, nor my coworkers ordering from here. nBy the way, my husband was starving and he did finished his cheese stake pocket but he said it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. nAnd for the pretzels Vinnie's keep their pockets and pretzels displayed in a glass case that keeps them warm but as soon as those pretzels cool off they're stiff and not very desirable.",1
"A hidden gem! My husband and I recently came to Vegas for a weekend and booked Vdara for about 168 a night. Considering Vdara is a new hotel in the City Center, it's an amazing deal. Once you enter the hotel, you get an amazing whiff of lavender or something instead of disgusting cigarettes, but that's because there's no casino in here. The bottom level pretty much consists of a lounge, restaurant mini mart, and check in area. When you're leaving the hotel, you can go one way and take the tram to Bellagio and the rest of the City Center or exit through the main doors and walk across the way either the Cosmo or Aria. My only complaint is that it's hard finding your way back to Vdara because like I said, it's hidden and there aren't many signs for it. Just remember your original route and back track. n nWe got the most basic room with a King bed and pull out couch and a big bathroom with a stand up shower and small tub NOT a hot tub or jacuzzi. There's also a mini kitchen with a stove, sink and microwave! I already have a room booked here at Vdara for EDC weekend and I cannot wait!",2
YEAH! Best place in the airport!,2
"Stay away. Salsa is bland and under seasoned, portions are tiny and expensive, rice OR beans not both , chips and salsa cost extra and include only one refill on chips. If you want to get nickel and dimed and leave disappointed, this is the place for you.",1
"Absolutely love this store, so friendly! So much better than the post office or fedex! They package things so well, I don't trust anyone to package my fragile stuff except for this store. They put so much love and care into packaging everything that goes out! I love this store and the service!",2
I'm really digging their wings and wood fired pizza. That they deliver to Beechview now is a plus. I definitely recommend City Oven.,2
"I've been to many resorts and this one is a very peculiar set up. not only is decorated and done nicely, rooms clean and space used very well, service is good, but the add on is that you take elevator to the first floor and they have many other amenities such as a Pizza Restaurant that uses a wood oven, a Hooka Bar, Einstein Bagels, Tequila M u00e9xican Restaurant and a Liquor Store. NICE! www.ensuritygroup.com",2
"24 7 is always appealing to me but I'm not so sure about this one. n nI grabbed a special combo meat bahn mi 11. It was decent, but I've had better and it needed more filling sauce pickles everything than it did. BF got a ham, turkey, cheese croissant. Decent, but not something out of the ordinary. The one thing that made the sandwiches less enjoyable is the haphazard way of throwing the ingredients in. Really, with no crazy rush of people waiting for food and a dozen employees around no one can be bothered to evenly spread out the toppings? n nI got a avocado shake and the BF got taro shake. Again, standard. Now the drinks made the guy at the register really confused. The BF was debating on a taro drink, but asked if they can do it just on ice instead of smoothie. The guy told him to ""get a Italian soda. I like passionfruit "". So the BF then says, ""I'd like a regular Sierra Mist "" so he can get something simple that won't confused the guy. The guy looked so confused and looked at the board behind him for minutes and goes ""coke?soda "". ""Yes, that is a type of soda up there "". He didn't know how to ring it up and just rang up some tea that wasn't even the same price. The BF just told him to cancel it and ring up the damn taro smoothie if that was easier. Seriously, you don't know what Sierra Mist is? n nAnother ding is that all the tables were dirty. All the booths were dirty so we went to find the least dirty table. At mightnight you seriously couldn't find time to wipe tables with 10 fucking staff members and maybe 2 tables occupied?! n n Even without dirty tables and confused personnel the taste is just A OK 3 star worthy at most. I don't really see myself coming here during daytime since there are other bahn mi spots that are better. However for late night eats, I welcome anything into the rotation if I am absolutely sick and tired of everything else. I may come back late night, but that means it's a last choice.",1
I really like this store. They have almost everything from green tea kitkats to huge woks. They also have a seafood section and fish can be cleaned and fried for free. They have an extensive fresh produce section as well. n 10 annual membership fee is worth it.,2
"Thank you F E for having such quality items at a reasonable price! Their blueberry muffins are only .99 and soooo fresh soft and delish. Their selection of fruits and veggies never disappoints and their naughty plethora of baked goods is a treat. Their employees are always courteous and friendly, sometimes passionate about recommending their personal favorites! n nFYI If you go late in the 11pm ish hours, you might score some freebies as they are marking down and need to move day old products! ",2
"My daughter and I had a great experience here. We just walked in, no appointment is necessary. This was my daughter's first waxing experience, and my last one was 17 years ago traumatic . For both of us it was almost painless, only a little sting, which is expected. Our new client waxes were free, but I left a nice tip, because they did a great job and were very friendly. We will be returning.",2
"I purchased the Groupon for this place when it became available. Despite the good deal, I didn't have high expectations for this place. n nWe came here this evening and decided to share several appetizers and a we each got a drink. The prices were pretty good. We shared buffalo wings, nachos with chicken and some sliders. Our waitress was beyond amazing. I was really impressed by how personable and attentive. She was friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled and had everything we needed. n nThe food was surprisingly good as well. It wasn't gourmet by any stretch of the imagination was it was very tasty and affordable. I look forward to coming here again for some affordable drinks and grub. Their happy hour specials look really good as well and they last until 7 daily.",2
Terrible service or should I say no service. I was told the plumber would be at my place between 0800 1000 and guess what? No one showed up nor was there a phone call. I called 30min after to find out what happened. The lady I believe they are out of state because she ask me what city I live in told me he was on the way and he would call me. No phone call or a plumber. I called back again to cancel. I called for another plumber who arrived in 15 min and more affordable. I highly don't recommend this place unless you want to wait all day long not knowing whats going on then this is your place. Terrible.,1
"I was suspicious as the idea of Asian burgers sounded strange, color me converted, these babies rock. The pineapple ketchup made me wonder why we ever used tomatoes. n nSo why not 5 stars? Coffee was not bottomless as they blew the circuit, though the charge was the same. This led to no milkshakes. n nI suppose what I am saying is that I should return to see if it is 5 star worthy. I am sure it is.",2
"I was hesitant to go to Mi Patio, but I'm glad I did. n nIf you scroll down through most of the reviews you'll see a pattern. The people who rate it high usually comment, ""You can't beat 2 margaritas! "" or you have a handful of comments from vegans who are happy to have found a Mexican option. Reviewers who stuck to talking about the food generally had lower ratings, so I had my reservations. But in the end I was just down the street so I decided to give it a try. n nI got the gyro chimi and it just worked. The flavor of the Greek classic came through perfectly inside of the Mexican wrapping. The cucumber sauce, lamb, and fried shell matched up perfectly. The zucchini side was an interesting change of pace and the rice was excellent. I enjoyed everything on the plate. n nOne knock against it It's oily. The contents of the chimi lamb, peppers, onions can't be as densely packed as a regular chimi so you start to notice some pockets of oil that form on the plate. Yes, I know a chimi is oily, but you usually it's absorbed by the food inside of it so you don't see it to the same extent. n nGive the chimi a shot and you won't regret it. I was there on a Saturday afternoon and the place has a nice mix of people enjoying some Mexican with others socializing at the bar. Good options for a wide range of people.",2
"Yes, this store is horrible. I rather stand in line at the post office. This place is family owned and operated, in which the family members are normally working. They actually stop me from asking a question so that they could talk to each other to figure out what to get o eat and drink. Poor customer service, unprofessional, lack of boxes for shipping, and lack in integrity.",1
"For the price and value this is place is horrible. For just a tad under 42 you get blah food that is so not worth the money. If you want crap to fill your stomach with and you've got money to burn then come on down! n nTo be brief, ""No Sir I don't like it "". n nDecor 4 nFood 1 nService 2 n nWould I go back? Nope",1
"If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new this is the place. Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it. We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing . again . I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them. That is the main reason I went back I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out. I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it . the tint was perfect. They use only the top quality film, and do quality work. I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long! If you are looking for a detail job, or window tint, this is the ONLY place you should be looking! Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done.",2
"Ill preface this by saying I'm a Fuente fan. This place is very well stocked with Fuente family cigars Fuente, Opus X, Ashton etc etc including some limited edition sticks. Kinda obvious given its family owned. I'm smoking a Arturo Fuente Hemingway Untold Story Maduro right now. Seating could be more comfy. Service is excellent. Bar is well stocked, however could always offer a little more. A great place to escape the in your face nature of Vegas and relax with an outstanding smoke.",2
just had my 5th and 6th cars done at Eco Tint. Mike and Courtney are awesome. I will never have any tint done anywhere else. the work they do it top of the line.,2
"Browsed around for easily 30 minutes in this tiny store and wasn't offered help once! n nThere were 5 sales associates, and me. No help. n nAnother customer walked in with her daughter and they were quick to say hello, offer help, and start a fitting room. WTH! n nToo bad, because I was in the market for a new suit.",1
"Really liked this place when it first opened. The last two times I have been here my food not sushi smelled like a chemical cleaner. When I commented on it, no attempt of resolution. I guess if you go, stick to the sushi, not the plated dinners.",1
"We set up a private cooking class for just two of us on a Monday evening. The entire process was completed in two short emails Maggie was quick to respond and very accommodating. n nMaggie was ready and completely set up right on time. After a few short demonstrations we were off and cooking. The menu I selected seemed simple, but all four food items had techniques Maggie helped us through. The menu she created took us out of our cooking comfort level and had us trying new methods. Under the watchful eye of the chef, we were soon prepping, braising, baking and cooking. n nThe food we made was great. Each dish was flavorful and well received. There is no doubt we will utilize the new skills to re create the menu at a later date to impress our friends. n nThe entire evening was fun. From her cooking lessons, to stories about her experiences, Maggie was as engaging as she was professional. The event was a complete success, one that I would highly recommend to anyone.",2
"For those of you planning to visit us, Babaloo's is no more. For those of you who know us I just wanted to take a minute to leave a heartfelt thank you. n nWhen someone opens a new restaurant it is an exciting moment, a nervous moment, a scary moment all rolled into one. If the worst thing that happens is a rack of wine glasses falling from the roof in a hail of glass then the opening can be considered a success many have endured far more nightmarish openings in this industry. n nAs the weeks, months, and years go by a funny thing happens to the special restaurants, the good restaurants they begin to feel like family and people come back. This was where I came in, almost a year ago today, as a simple restaurant server with over 10 years of previous restaurant management experience. I was not the best server, but I noticed that both customers and employees alike were always grateful, and made me feel at home. This was the beauty of Babaloo's it felt like family. n nTo Robert, Myra, George, Adam, Emily, Jon, Rob, Erika, and anyone I may have forgotten I offer my deepest thanks for allowing me to be part of your lives. To all of the wonderful people who came to see us over and over again, I would far prefer to work a table seated with people I know, and you all never failed to help me out with that. Babaloo's did not close because of the folks that supported us, it closed because sometimes in the bleakest economy a business fails, even despite the greatest efforts of those trying to keep it going. nIt was a fun ride. Thanks Rob!",2
"I've been here twice. The first time was about two years ago with my Korean teammate and we did bbq at our table. It was amazing! The food and the service was good. I have been talking about this place and wanting to come for a long time. n nFast forward to now. I had my farewell dinner here and brought about 15 people. The bbq was delicious but, unfortunately, anyone who had anything else had complaints. The customer service was terrible. One of the girls at our table was not even asked once what she wanted to eat and one of the servers got visibly upset about one of the tickets and crumpled it up at our table. A few of my friends were super pumped about the all you can eat sushi. I heard that the rolls had way too much rice and too little fish. Lastly, one of my friends said he got food poisoning. n nI would say come with a small group or just a couple friends and just focus on the bbq.",1
"Food was pretty good, however the service was a problem. We were seated right away but then waited for an interminable period with no one coming to our table. Some other tables that came in after us were waited upon promptly. After a while it got so bad that I got up and asked the hostess what was up with this. She ended up waiting on us herself but didn't seem real happy about it. In the meantime the rest of the waitstaff continued their erratic and distant behavior. To top it all off after I visited this restaurant someone used the credit card info to order 600 worth of coffeemakers. I'm thinking there was a connection.",1
"We were visiting family in Scottsdale and they took us to dinner at this location, because they like Pita Jungle and because this was supposedly one of the original, non franchise locations. In their words ""this is the best Mediterranean food you'll have. And their vegetarian food is amazing. "" Maybe I'm spoiled with Greek, Lebanese and nouvelle Mediterranean food establishments on the East Coast, but I was prepared to be amazed. No such luck! The Patio was full on the lovely evening we went there and inside was cold and very loud, with the industrial decor doing nothing to make conversations easy. The friendly hostess made sure we had our own nook can you please re upholster the banquettes or change the seats, they are uncomfortably worn out and left us to wait for our server. It took a long time for water to appear and even longer for our server. We ordered drinks and a plate of what is commonly known as meze appetizers with warm pita to share while we were deciding what to get for dinner. Amazingly, they charge for each pita above the two that come with the platter. And two is not enough for a shared plate. Our wine finally came out, gingerly carried by our server with fingers on the bowl yuck! The platter of appetizers was underwhelming 2 falafel, deep fried into oblivion, some passable tabbouleh, slabs of feta, 2 rice filled grape leaves, which were so uniform that they must have been industrially made and finally spoonfuls of hummus, tzatziki, baba ghanoush and ratatouille ? . The dips were okay, nothing you couldn't buy in any decent grocery store these days. The ratatouille was a far cry from it, and not even close to the Mediterranean ""Ghiveci "" you can get in Greek, Turkish, etc. restaurants or make at home. The chunks of zucchini were big, the rest nonexistent and in a thin, bland sauce. No sooner had we dug into the appetizers, that our main dishes show up and the server and busboy hustle to make room for them. In other words, say goodbye to whatever you wanted to mop up with pita on the appetizer platter! Our serve got half the orders wrong, but by that time we were really hungry. Not only did the server argue with us about what we ordered, we were cowed into eating what was placed in front of us. The vaunted Shrimp Paesano special was one pound yes, one pound! of noodles with four measly shrimp on top and shreds of some vegetables. The fish on the salad was raw, not seared and my lavosh portobello pizza deserves a sentence of its own. Nice crisp crust, good mix of cheeses and tomato slices, basil not herbs, as in the menu sliced and not chiffonaded, but here was the kicker the mushrooms were in thick slices, they were raw and the olives scattered on the pizza had pits in them! When finally summoned over, our server offered to have the kitchen cook the mushrooms. Having read about what might happen to food that goes back, I politely declined. In the end we got free dessert, a nice touch and both the rice pudding and the baklava were tasty, albeit run of the mill. We like our family, so we agreed with whatever they said, but even my husband who will pretty much eat anything shook his head.",1
"I love this place the atmosphere, the food, the service everything is always on par. From looking at the photos from previous years it looks like they updated from a diner feel to a hipster coffee brewery type feel. I love the open kitchen design, you can see your foods being made fresh. Despite the design it doesn't smell like a diner so you don't leave needing to change your cloths. The service has a laid back and friendly feel but is always pretty speedy. Sometimes we sit at that bar and that's always really nice and kind of fun too. We love that this place is local and supports other local businesses. The food? Always amazing. Healthy and more indulgent options to satisfy everyone. Plus there are a lot of create your own options to satisfy even the pickiest eater. My current fave is the farmers market omelet, the hubby loves the 3 dollar plate of bacon. Definitely stop here if your out in awatukee!",2
"I was refused access to the bathroom by the security guard, stating that the restroom closes at 10pm. I had a little accident on the way home. I should have just discreetly peed on the CVS floor as I had no reasonable alternative. n nI won't shop here again even though this is the most convenient drug store location for me. I'm literally pissed off at this place.",1
My family is vegetarian and the food was amazing! We found our new fav Mexican food place in Laval! The music was loud and the place was happening. But there are booths available where a family can sit and have an amazing meal away from the speakers. Was disappointed with the spiceness level of their table sauces 4 kinda and had to pay 1.50 extra for the hotter sauce. However the spicy on request vege burrito was delicious! My soft taco with cactus and avocado was savory and the spinach and cheese enchiladas was zesty! Will definitely come back.,2

At Rita's you can have your italian ice and eat your custard too. Beyond the product, the service is always friendly enough and they offer enough deals to keep me coming back. It's that simple.",2
"This DD location suffers from ""hit or miss "" customer service. There usually seem to be new ish people learning the registers during the most inopportune times, such as during the weekend morning rush, and so the line backs up and orders get confused. n nI warn that you come armed with some patience but there are usually a couple of friendly faces behind the counter trying their best to get people in and out. Since you'll most likely be waiting in line, I suggest checking the DD app because there are usually coupons deals available that require no registration.",1
"This is a strange little place, located near the C1 gate in the busy, crowded Southwest Airlines concourse. Even though it looks like a regular restaurant, there doesn't appear to be any table service. After seating myself at an open table, I waited about ten minutes and watched other patrons go to the bar to order food and drink. So after perusing the menu, I wandered over and asked if anything on their menu could be made gluten free. I have celiac disease, so eating gluten is a big no for me. Sadly, nothing on their menu is GF. n nBut I was thirsty, so I did order a pomegranate mojito. Here's where Corcoran's earned its second star. The bartender made it by hand, and it was good and strong. Not sure it was worth the price with tip it came to almost 20 but it definitely hit the spot before a long flight home to Atlanta.",1
"We enjoyed our weekday stay at this hotel in downtown Montreal. The location is fabulous walking distance to the train station if you don't have too much luggage. n nThe rooms have a clean, modern feel and are on the small side. We were upgraded to a suite fun! and even that was a bit small. The bed was comfortable and I quite enjoyed the plush pillows. I liked that the windows had both a shade and curtains so that we could better control the light in the room. Speaking of light what fun light fixtures! We thought they were pretty nifty. The TV was wall mounted and had a swivel mount so we could turn it to watch from the bed, which was quite nice. There was a small kitchenette with a fridge, coffee pot, sink, and microwave that all tucked into cabinets made everything look sleek. The lighting around the kitchenette was not the best, but still manageable. n nThere's no real parking nearby, so it's great for people using transit during their stay but not if you'll be bringing a car. n nIn terms of food, there didn't seem to be a kitchen in the hotel and the breakfast was just muffins. The line was quite long when we went down, so we didn't do a taste test. There is a nice sized convenience store attached to the hotel didn't even have to go outside! The shop had a good selection and the guy was great, even a bit funny n nStaff at the hotel were polite, bilingual, helpful, and very friendly. They were able to answer any question we had with ease.",2
"Maybe I caught this place on a bad day? nI was not impressed in the least. n nFirst of all, the organization was awful. 2 registers but so many people just standing around waiting for their food that I couldn't tell if they were in line or just waiting. The prepared salads seemed WAY overpriced for the amount of salad you actually got. Also, when asking what type of bakery was in the case, the cashier had to guess for some items which really turned me off from buying a mystery pastry. n nI finally ended up with a egg sandwich on an English muffin with avocado. It was tasty, but at 8 bucks, my pockets were not pleased with my choice. n nThis stop was better than eating at a fast food place, but it was a clustered mess and the prices were way too high for my liking.",1
"Cool place to bring the kids. We basically ate for nothing, let me explain n nSince both of my kids made it to honor roll, they get 5 bucks worth of tokens and a free personal pan pizza. Yes we had to foot the bill for drinks, but after 4 bucks we spent a few hours here. n nPretty good deal and a great way to encourage kids to get good grades. Dinner, games, and a family event what else could you ask for? n nGreat customer service and in general the staff enjoy being around kids.",2

"Ate here on a recent business trip to LV. I was pleasantly surprised. I opted for the price fixe which was a 12 oz DRY AGED new york. They do not normally offer dry aged on their menu and since I have never had a dry aged steak I went for it. The whole meal was delicous. Bread, Steak, sides, dessert. it was one of the best meals in LV I have ever had. and I eat out a lot LOL. I am now a fan of Dry Aged beef and now know why it is so highly regarded. It's just that much more delicate and tasty it's so hard to describe. n n5 STARS!",2
We love this place! My husband and I visited New Orleans last Feb. and this place is quite authentic! Lots of fired food but that's the best part. nI had the fried catfish and shrimp basket and it was very good. My husband had the fried craw fish and the dip that came with it was very good. Almost like a bar b que but with a little something extra. Definitely worth the try. We will be returning!,2
"Frozen Hot Chocolate is what they're famous for but the service is terrible. 1 star for the frozen hot chocolate, 1 star for the location and 3 stars for terrible, terrible service.",1
"We ate here a month ago on a Saturday night with my daughter and had an great time at the sushi bar eating and talking to the chefs. Tonight after the hostess took phone calls while people were waiting she told us children can't sit at the sushi bar on the weekends, so we left. Honestly, it seemed like a lie so she could send us to a table. It's upsetting because the food is good. But after being treated the way we were I'll never go back with or without my daughter.",1
"Wow. I can't I have to write this review about a place I used to love. nI just checked and in October 2014 I wrote a 5 star review. little did I know that a few weeks later I would be treated so poorly. n nTowards the end of November I received a call from someone in the office. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name She explained that my Pap Smear had come back abnormal and that I needed to come in for another procedure Colposcopy . When I asked how much the procedure was for she told me that with my not having met my insurance deductible for 2013 year it would be around 200. I explained that I did not have 200 at the current time and that I would like to wait until January to have this procedure if possible, so that I could save up the money and also so that it would go towards my deductible for the whole year 2014 . She seemed aggravated by my reply and hastily informed me that I needed this procedure as I probably have cancer. And this is not something I should be putting off. I told her that I didn't have a choice and this is what I had to do at the moment. I informed her I would call back in January. n nFortunately, for me I've had a very similar situation happen to me when I was 20 years old, so I am aware that often doctor staff is not well versed in explaining procedures to patients. I was a little shocked that she would basically threaten me with cancer, but also tried to understand that she was hopefully just looking out for me. I'll be honest I found her to be incredibly rude and had considered writing this review at that point. The holidays got in the way I let it go. n nOn Jan 15 when I called to discuss scheduling my appointment, I was pretty shocked to learn that the doctor had dropped me as a patient and that I would have to see if she would consider taking me back on. The girl was a lot nicer this phone call, but I was furious. I have been a patient for a few years and I was very upset to have to go through the horrible process of trying to find a new lady doctor. n nThis is outrageous to me and honestly if this is how they run their business I don't want to be a patient. I feel like the doctor staff only care about my getting cancer if I am able to schedule my appointments at their convenience. If this was such an important procedure for me to have, you would think the doctor herself would have contacted me. n nPersonally, I think it is inappropriate for anyone other than the doctor to be discussing whether or not I may have cancer with me over the phone. That is a very scary thing to tell someone and I don't think it should be thrown around so lightly. Clearly the patients are not that important. n nIt's a shame because I really liked Dr. Haydee Docasar and thought that I had found a permanent OBGYN. I'm really disappointed that I have to find a new one.",1
"Really good boba spot. I love the red bean slush, taro red bean slush, and the coffee slush. Their popcorn chicken is good as well. My coworkers love the Thai slush.",2
"I tried this place when it first opened and it was pretty good. But today I was quite disappointed. First of all this is not New York style Chinese food. The picture on their website shows their wonton soup New York style but I did not get anything like that. The large soup had just a few shreds of pork and scallions in it that it was not enough to share with 2 people but it was also sooo salty we couldn't eat it. Their pork fried rice was terrible again loaded with too much salt and had some sort of distinct flavor that I have never had in fried rice before. I will say their fried chicken wings were good. Also thank goodness I grabbed some condiments on the way out because they did not even put a fork, spoon or any sauces in my takeout bag except the sauce that went with the chicken wings . I did read some reviews said some days are better than others .well we all know how annoying it is to get a bad meal.",1
"I have been to this restaurant on several occasions, including my most recent experiences with their brunch menu. The atmosphere was much more upbeat in the morning than their dinner hours. Facing the street was the open bar accompanied by the sunny patio. On this Sunday, the lazy sunshine was slowly triggering through its rustic interior. n nI highly recommend their Eggs Benedict 13 . My dish came with perfectly poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, crispy potatoes, and smoked salmon. The thick cut smoked salmon was delicious and not too salty. The thick gooey hollandaise sauce added refinement to the fantastic doughy texture of the English muffin. There was great purpose, balance and distribution of flavors. The potatoes were lightly salted and quite addictive. It had all the elements I was looking for in a benedict. n nI also enjoyed the Fall Squash Risotto 13 served with crispy pork belly, squash, parmesan, rosemary honey, and risotto. The pork belly was nicely marbled to provide a nice contrast to the perfectly executed risotto. I wished this dish could come with more squash to accompany the risotto, but otherwise it's a dish I'd order again. n nThe Farmer's Market Frittata 10 was really fantastic too. It came with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, cheddar, arugula, tomato, and other seasonal vegetables layered on top of the omelet. The combination of veggies was fresh and the range of diverse flavors further complicated the omelet at the bottom. It's a lighter alternative than the benedict, but we still had plenty of leftover to take home. n nThe dishes that did not live up to my expectations were the Cinnamon Roll 5 and the Iron Skillet Pancake 8 . The Cinnamon Roll was expensive but also humongous and good to share. It tasted dry, bread like, and lacked the full on moisture that I prefer in a cinnamon roll. It's a novelty and highly visible at every table, but unfortunately not something I'll be ordering again. n nThe Iron Skillet Pancake came with olive oil, dark chocolate, berry compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup. The price was too steep for a single pancake. The pancake was easy to cut into until the sticky crispy outer ring. The berry compote was overwhelming the dark chocolate, but it was still a decent pancake without the expected wow factor. n nMy dining companion did not enjoy the coffee, so it's not something I would recommend. Service can be inconsistent, but friendly and responsive when you have their attention. There's not a lot of innovative breakfast and brunch restaurants in the Phoenix area, so St. Francis is a solid option for those looking for conventional wisdom with a twist of refinement. The other downside to the experience was parking. They have a small lot, and the required valet can be frustrating as you wait for your car when it is parked right in front of you. n nWith all considered, 3.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in coming back for dinner.",2
"Went today for lunch, very nice experience! Waiter was helpful Cesar and explained menu as it was our first time! Had delicious ice tea, house salad and individual pizzas! Food came quickly and hot! Not a big selection for lunch pizzas or calzones but the basic! Intend to come again and get a large one with more topping! A little more pricey than average pizza place but the service and added elegance table cloths, cloth napkins made it worth it! I recommend you try it if you like thin crust pizza, just the right amount of sauce and a crispy crust which I do love!",2
Greath nGood and great food seafood and service I highly recommend dinning at the sls buffet,2
"I reserved judgment until my second visit. It's just not good. n nToday I ordered the kung pao noodle bowl with tofu. When they called my number, they had made it with chicken. I told them about the mistake and they re made the dish. When I got it back it was mostly cold and just did not have good flavor. The way they slice their vegetables doesn't really make sense. The slices of red and green bell peppers were huge. It didn't taste fresh, and there was no depth of flavor, just a lot of sweet sauce. Nowhere close to real kung pao. The Lipton tea they have tastes very processed, and not ""fresh brewed "" as it is labeled.",1
"Was super excited to try this place because I am a fan, but ended up being severely disappointed. Walked up to the nearly deserted restaurant and was told it was an hour and a half wait. The 3 of us found seating at the bar and quickly pored over the menu. In the end we only ordered 3 things bacon cheeseburger, chips, and a Caesar salad. When the order was put in our server, Ramon, talked to us a bit explaining about how unique the uniforms are. Then he completely ignored us, along with the rest of the staff because they were either talking about their workout routines, diet, or flirting with the waitress with the new boobs. Time passed without so much as a refill. 30 minutes later Ramon said, ""your foods not here yet? "" Clearly the empty placemat was a clue. Another 15 minutes passed and he woke up out if his stupor to again say, ""wow, your food still isn't out?! "" 2 minutes later it finally arrived. The salad was more a bowl of dressing with a few lettuce leaves. The burger and chips were extremely bland. It took another 10 minutes to flag down Ramon for the check. When it arrived we paid with 2 cards and cash. I wrote the payments down and even explained it. Well, Ramon pocketed the cash and charged my card double. I flagged him down again and pointed out his mistake. He said he must not have heard me and fixed it. All in all it was a shit experience. I would expect more from a restaurant owned my someone who has shows where he gets people and their restaurants in line. Bottom line You're better off at a buffet.",1
"LOVE going to the drive inns with the family. Such a great deal, 6.50 for adults kids under 5 are free. You can bring your own food drinks in without having to smuggle them in. They do have a snack bar with a good selection of food snacks that are decently priced. For 6.50 you can watch 3 movies. The 1st one starts around 7 30 a little later in the summer and there are 2 showings after that. The kids normally pass out towards the end of the 1st movie, then Mommy Daddy can relax and watch another movie together. Tonight we watched Kung Fu Panda 2 and our 2nd movie is about to start. Great times, I love my man!",2
Great food and friendly service! Will go back.,2
Lots of laughs and screams on this ride. Priced right for Vegas. This would have been 5 a star if the ride was a little longer.,2
"The best bagel shop I have been to ever! They have sooo many choices of bagels, and listen to customer feedback just added a Hawaiian bagel! The staff there are very friendly and efficient! Anyone who lives around mesa must visit this cute bagel shop , you can also place an order to go. There phone number is 480 807 5010. There prices are very reasonable as well. nI used to always get my coffee from starbucks in the morning, but i am now getting them here, they have the best iced caramel mocchiato's and are cheaper than starbucks. n nThey also have a punch card that you can use when you purchase anything . 10th punch is on them!",2
"We had a GREAT dinner here! Service was impeccable and it was just an all around nice experience. I was in the mood for some Italian and we checked out this place because we were shopping around in the Forum. We chose to be seated at the bar, we usually prefer to sit at the bar, it makes for more of a fun experience. n nWe split the calamari, ceasar salad and stuffed eggplant. Even though we split everything, it was A LOT of food. We looked around and we saw that the rest of the dishes that everyone else had were decent sized as well. The calamari was breaded perfectly and the dipping sauce was tasty. The ceasar was yummy but a little messy because the croutons were HUGE. nThe stuffed eggplant was pretty good, the past inside was yummy but the eggplant was overcooked a bit, it didn't bother me too much because by that time I was too full to eat any of it. n nIt was a good meal for the price. I just decided to drink 20 worth of wine, which is very easy to do in an italian joint and in Vegas. I would go back again especially to try some of that gelato to go.",2
"Long long wait, table of six on a Saturday night took 2 hours 15 min. But if your not in a rush, and with good friends, lots to enjoy.",2
"I was curious to see just how big this suveneir store after seeing the sign . The store is practically filled with cheaply made ugly junk from China ! There's really nothing worth buying . The suveneir stores in Vegas can't compare to the ones in SF . the suveniors in SF are much nicer , better made , and more worthwhile .",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Lunch margaritas are my favorite. I now crave their fish tacos and taco salads ALL THE TIME. Remodeled their bar a while back, looks amazing.lots of TVs. Tableside guac is also another must have.",2
"I went here to get my eyebrows waxed today and was pretty happy with them. I walked in on a whim without an appointment and they took me right away. This was really no spa experience, but it was clean and the girl that did my eyebrows was thorough. The only thing that was a little off putting was that the girl asked if I wanted her to wax other parts of my face.but there is no reason for me to do that as I do not have coarse or dark hair anywhere else on my face.makes me think they are really just trying to make extra money for unnecessary services. Also, when I went to pay with my card, they asked if I had cash and were pretty insistent on getting cash.a little shady, and then when she gave me change she didn't give me any ones to try to get a larger tip. Overall, I felt like this place was a little shady, but it was inexpensive and they did a good job, so I suppose I can look past these things.",2
Bergies has a great location with excellent outside seating. I stop by weekly to buy fresh roasted beans and get a cup of brewed for the ride home. Excellent quality.,2
"Lousy customer service! The blonde girl the cashier boy short one you both sucks! Made me wait in line for nothing. I picked 2 Pima basic for 20. The cashier boy said it's 12.95 each. I have to get the right one, went back to the rack, met the blonde near the front door, she said ""yes, they're 2 for 20 "" I went back to the cashier he insist ""no, they didn't ring up "" WTF! It's not rocket science. Every H M has it, can't believe it! I will call your head office for such an incompetent service. nNo surprised, Maghan the blonde girl gave me bad number for customer service. However, I found one",1
WAY to expensive. I brought 2 pairs of jeans to be shortened 35 each and 2 sets of curtains to be shortened 3 inches 120 for a total price of 190. It would of been cheaper for me to buy myself 2 new pairs of jeans and 2 new curtains that fit my windows. Her work was equal to any other tailor I have ever experienced. Save yourself some money and go somewhere else.,1
"As I walked into Seamus McCaffrey's, I felt like I was in a serious downtown. If I hadn't known better, I could have said I was in a Chicago or San Francisco. This bar was jumping with locals, live music bounced off the walls and character filled the room. n nThe bar is divey, it's cozy, it's dark and it's awesome. The drinks are cheap, the patrons are awesome and there's plenty of seating. Downtown Phoenix could use about 15 more types of these bars. n nI visited Seam McCaffrey's after a Diamondbacks game and it was so cool to see Downtown Phoenix alive and bustling on a Friday night. This bar is like a little taste of what the entire Downtown Phoenix area could be like if we took every bar and restaurant filled with character like this and placed them on the same block. Having just got back from Chicago, this bar definitely reminded me of the character the Chicago bars have and it really made my night to see it! n nSo bottoms up Seamus McCaffrey's! You make Phoenix proud!",2
"Totally lucked out. n nAfter a horrible dinner experience, I needed something to cheer me up. Off we went to S3. n nWhen we arrived around 8p, we were disappointed that there was a wait time of 45 hour wait. We asked about to go, and the hostess suggested the bar and that they would take our order. n nWe waited in line for several mins and a couple seats opened up at the bar. SCORE! We ordered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate for 2 14 and were served within 5 mins! It would have taken 3 times the wait time had we waited in the bar line. n nThe FHC reminded me of a Starbux frap with the texture and taste. I could have done without all the whip, but apparently that is part of the whole experience. n nWe were in and out within 20 mins, thanks to the bar area!",2
"I'm really surprised about the star rating as one person said it was very good food but only gave them 3 stars cuz it was IHOP. How is that fair? n nMy daughter and I were seated immediately. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all so we got service very quick although it took us a little while to figure what we wanted. n nThis was the very best IHOP I've ever been to. The food looked just like the picture which was surprising since no restaurant's food looks like their pictures anywhere. I was so happy to see the pancakes so perfect. n nThere were only a few people working. One waiter, 1 Manager I think that's what he was , and a cook. The restaurant was very clean, the server was polite and attentive and again, the food was perfect. n nHopefully, my visit was the norm because I do plan on returning for some more of those lightly browned pancakes! n nI really don't know what these other star raters are talking about. Maybe the stars were aligned and the pancake gods reigned down maple flavored fairy dust on me that day because the food was terrific and the staff did their jobs. n nIf you want some good IHOP food, Go here and get it!",2
"I was a little hesitant about this place since I'm kinda picky with food, but I must say that I was impressed. I had the Chicken Kiev and it was quite good, albeit a little small. Highly recommend the potatoes as a side item. Our dessert took a really long time to come out we had the s'mores creme brulee but when it did, it was worth the wait. The manager also felt so bad that she bought us shots which was really nice. nThe atmosphere was really cool and unique too. Loud music made talking difficult but it was just a fun place to go. I would definitely go back.",2
"Always good food !, PHO DA LAT is he best in Phx , Veggie broth , Veggie Pho with steamed tofu is awesome , and don't forget to order the quail appetizer .",2
"LAME! This show is totally made for sheltered people were just saying the word SEX in public is a thrill! I was really expecting something great from Cirque du Soleil but found myself totally disappointed. There was no WOW factor to it. Just some boobs here and there, a few dance moves, and one REALLY cheesy male stripper who looked straight out of 1981! I would save your money unless you're one of the people I mentioned before and go to Crazy Horse in NY NY. I doesn't have great reviews on here, but trust me if you think Zumanity is a bit lame, you'll love crazy horse. It doesn't show boobs just to show boobs because he he he thats a private part! Seriously save your money!",1
"Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their ALL DAY happy hour every Sunday! The bucatini and meatballs at 5 is an absolute STEAL I highly recommend doing a double order and calling it dinner! The noodles are homemade and delectably thick and chewy, the red sauce is fresh, and the small meatballs are moist and delicious! n nWe started tonight with the grilled artichoke, which was extremely tasty but highly overpriced at 12 for a single small medium sized artichoke. We also ordered the arancini, which was oozing with cheesy goodness and comes three to an order. During happy hour, the arancini is 5 an order, which is totally reasonable for the size of the app regular price is about double. I ordered the braised short rib and ricotta gnocchi, which was beautifully presented and nicely cooked, but it was bland and lacked seasoning. The bombolini dessert was a lovely end to a great meal four cinnamon sugar covered ""beignets "" on a bed of real vanilla mascarpone and Meyer lemon curd. n nThe service was amazing and the food was great! The only downfalls were the intense number of flying insects invading our table space and the co ed bathrooms. I'm all for social progress but there's a good reason men and women have maintained separate bathrooms throughout history, and it has nothing to do with gender segregation. It's just that guys always pee all over the toilet seats. n nOverall, it was another great dining experience, brought to you courtesy of Fox Restaurant Concepts, and we will definitely be taking advantage of this happy hour again in the near future!",2
"I just ordered a chimichanga from felipitos. AMAZING! I would gladly pay 10.00 for it, but the price was 5.63. It was humongous! Chicken in every bite. If you want authentic Mexican that's inexpensive, Felipitos is the answer. n nUpdate I've been coming to this glorious 24 hour establishment since the summer of 2005, and Felipito's never fails me, unless it's the sorry location on decatur. I seem to be addicted to their Carne asada burritos. 95 of the burrito is Carne Asada meat! The other 5 is the guac, pico de gallo, and of course the tortilla. n nIt's all outdoors, so you better bring a jacket if you wanna eat there during the winter. n nAnother highlight to me, is their Chicken Burrito, not the grilled one, just straight 'chicken burrito'. 96 chicken, 4 cheese and tortilla. The chicken is always piping hot with the cheese melting. Mmm it's actually a chicken quesadilla in a burrito but with less cheese, and way more chicken. n nAnytime I'm on the eastside of LV, I gotta make a trip to Felipitos. I'll go out of my way for it too.",2
"Our all time favorite restaurant. Every time we visit Las Vegas, Firefly is one of the 1st places we must go to. The food is always excellent and is presented unlike most restaurants exactly as it looks in their advertised photos. Our menu favorites are their petite filet, apple manchego salad and the stuffed dates, but there are so many more that are amazing. And, their Sangria is the Best this side of Spain. I'm not kidding. Once you have tried Firefly's Sangria, no one else's will ever be acceptable again.",2
"Positives n Chips and salsa n Nice outdoor seating n Fish tacos with light salad was delicious n Affordable prices n nNegatives n It took 45 min for the food to be brought out even though the restaurant was not very busy and especially after several inquiries about our order, stressing that we needed to be back for a conference. Because the food came out so late we had to get it boxed up. n Orders were incorrect. n No apologies from management or wait staff.",1
Dining review CRAVE Downtown Summerlin n nFood was ok. Service.SUCKED. It was only 3pm and not busy. Waited approx 10 minutes to get seated basically since they were waiting for the new shift of staff to come in. Waited at our table for another 15 20 minutes for a server to arrive. We had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted so we did drink and food order at the same time. Drinks arrived we only ordered water and never were given refills .then waited well over 30 minutes for just a turkey burger and chicken stir fry to show up. We saw our server only 3 times in the hour we were there and had to almost tackle him to pay attention to us to get our tab. Manager walked around a lot and was on his cell. Not a good view when people are waiting for food or have that look like they need assistance but no one is showing up. We weren't the only table that seemed to be forgotten. Staffing needs some work and management could step up and help out more as well in my opinion. We probably won't be going back. nTurkey burger was average and the chicken in the chicken stir fry was thinly sliced like it could of been used in a chicken sandwich or BLT style sandwich.,1
"Soo much cola here. Samples of the world are awesome. There is not just coca cola here there is sprite, fanta, and all other coke owned sodas. Photos are a little expansive. They have ocaisional printed bottles here too. They have coke antiques, glasses, chains, and coke everything. Some days they have ice cream float attachments to your soda. Everything is good here.",2

"PORK BURGERS ! n n please, sir I'm using that as an adjective, not a verb n nahem THEY HAVE PORK BURGERS ! n nA delicious addition to the menu. The only problem is, I already had a short list of must try it next time that I can never seem to get to, since everything I've had I loved so much I didn't want to order anything else. n until the next time Ric or Chef J talked me into trying something new, that is n nThis is the new favorite. I don't even put any catsup or sauce on it, just meat, bread, veggies. n nFrench fries are hand cut and double fried to a crispy chewy constistency that is rare and satisfying. n nI really mean to try to 'Loaded Spud' and the chopped chicken someday, but between the burger, porkburger, and pulled pork, I may never get there.",2
"Went here after work for a quick Mickey D fix. I had order a 6 piece chicken nuggets meal. Sorry to say but I think it will be my last time here. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted fine by my insides didn't think so.",1
"Let me start of by saying i should have written this a few days ago when we went there but i never got the chance! nI work in a busy restaurant on the strip and got off around Ten,i felt bad for my husband who said he was Hungary so i suggested we go to Metro for the first time, nwe arrived and we were not greeted,we waited and someone finally came over,the place was empty with one large party of maybe 8 and a two top,when we sat down i noticed how dirty the place is,the floor was covered in food droppings and our booth seats were ripped and our table was sticky,i checked the menu and was surprised at their prices,but i hoped it was a good indication that the food was good. nthe Waitress was pleasant,we ordered a Hawaiian , but i explained to her my husband didn't like peppers so one half needed to be without peppers,and then she said ok without peppers but with extra bacon on his side and i said no,just without peppers. nAfter about 15 mins,i told my husband i was exhausted and that we should just get the pizza to go,i was expecting at this stage the pizza would be almost ready.wrong,i waved over the waitress and paid for the pizza which was 25.00 a complete rip off,we ended up waiting another 15 mins before we got our pizza.keep in mind we were the only people in the place ordering at this point. nWe walked home and i opened the box to discover we had no peppers on any of the pizza and extra bacon on one half.the pizza was doughy and way to heavy on the toppings also lacked any flavor. nSo in short the service was bad,the pizza was bad, and the price was outrageous,i would never return,if you live in the area, try Cuigino's which has some of the best Italian food i have tasted outside of Italy and the family hail from Naples, also it is a fraction of the price!",1
Came here friday night and got seated right away at the sushi bar. They ran out of toro and do not have ume. nThey brought the wrong appetizer for my husband and the beer from tap seems flat. While enjoying our appetizer a server carrying a bunch of plates hit my husband on the back of his neck with all these dirty plates No apologies and walks away! Food overpriced! Don't come here!,1
"Now that I'm on Yelp, I can finally review this place like it deserves. Dotty's burgers are one of the few things I crave and miss about Madison, WI. A friend brought me here when I first arrived in Wisconsin, and I consistently went back over the next six years. All friends that I have brought there absolutely love it. The setting is ambient, it has a very traditional bar feel to it with wooden seats and high tables. The atmosphere fits into a variety of styles, which is probably why it is such a popular place to go for a large demographic of people. I have had friends who had their first date here, which is strange considering you're trying to carry a conversation while chomping down on a messy burger. n nThe food is phenomenal. I always split an appetizer sampler with a friend and got a Melting Pot burger, though I pretty much have had all the burgers on their menu at one point or another. The burgers tend to be cooked more than what you ask, so if you want an actual medium burger, I would ask for a medium rare. I like my burgers medium well, so it wasn't a huge problem for me. The Melting Pot is edible without any additional condiments, as the English garlic sauce is pretty much heaven in a bun. The burger patties are tender. If you want to be a little more fancy, I'd highly recommend getting a bison burger. You can sub the regular beef patty with a bison patty in any of their signature burgers for a slight fee. All their burgers are top notch and are among the best burgers I have ever had, but they tend to get messy since the buns are fluffy and soft. I loved their buns, but I know some prefer their burgers to be in buns that are a little more firm. n nThe sampler is hit or miss depending on who is frying them, but that only means it varies in degrees of deliciousness. The cheese curds are some of the best bar curds I've ever had in Madison. The fried mushrooms are great with the garlic sauce, though they might not be for some because they're very hot and filled with grease. The mac and cheese wedges are probably my favorite, and you can dip them in just about anything to add some flavor. The fries are fairly average, and the onion rings tend to be the most unpopular thing there since they have thick breading and are huge. n nThey have a decent beer list for a diner pub. I would not recommend going when there are events around campus, as this place tends to be packed. They also only serve a limited menu for Kohl Center events, and it is much better to be able to choose something special off their regular menu instead.",2
"Second time at this location and it will definitely be my last. I don't even know what the servers name was because she didn't even introduce herself. Only saw her twice, when she brought us our drinks and when she brought us our food. Had to flag down a different server to being us our check and to ask for refills. I am a female who came in with my boyfriend, I bet she would've payed more attention to us If we're creepy old guys. Never again. Horrible service, only reason I gave two stars is because the food was edible.",1
If you want to go here stick to the drink menu. The margaritas are delicious! The chips were good but the salsa was a little bland than what I'm use to. What started as a 10 minute wait turned into 40min. We asked for a new high chair as ours was broken and we watched as 4 more families came in with working chairs and we never received ours. The enchiladas left little to be desires. The chicken was perfectly cooked but everything was so bland. I've also never been to a place that uses sour cream and there was about a half a tub on my food. I would def go back for drinks though!,1
"Drove past this place for years always wondering how it stayed in business. I thought ""how good could a donut be from there? "" Look at the place? Well, after all the reviews I finally tried it and I have to say that they make some VERY tasty donuts. My favorites are the custard filled donuts and on Fridays the Chocolate French Crullers. So simple and yet so delicious! I just think back of all the years wasted by just driving by and never stoppping to check it out. Lesson learned.never judge a book by its cover.",2
"Service was outstanding. My waiter, Stew, was super attentive and friendly too. Whenever an employee went by me, they would check on me. n nI had the chicken fajitas that were on special. Hot, fresh and tasted great. I asked for them to be extra spicy, and I received a small side dish with a fresh jalape u00f1o sliced for me. No stinky pickled peppers here. n nI sat on their ""outside patio "", which overlooks the rainforest, waterfall area. n nI enjoyed my experience. I'll be back.",2
"Wouldn't it be nice to write a decent review for an airport restaurant without biasing your information to the location? Airport food doesn't have to be good, so it usually is not. O I tries a little harder, but still falls into this category. n nIt did hook me from the start, in that it did not LOOK like your typical airport place. The menu on the wall appeared hand made, the food choices were creative and attractive. They even have a coffee bar displaying a list of real espresso drinks! n nExecution, on the other hand, wasn't what I was hoping for. All the signs of fast food were there sloppy assembly, cold in the middle hot on the outside temperature distribution, and an ordering process that confused everyone. But most of all, the menu items were fast food sized. Two sandwiches would have been a more appropriate order for my meager frame. And the coffee? It was ok, I'll give it that much. n nMaybe some day the world will find an airport restaurant that doesn't capitalize on it's captive customer base by providing a truly decent meal. O I isn't there yet.",1
"We went here on Sunday for the tail end of the brunch buffet. We got in line a little bit before 2pm, and finally after about an hour we were finally seated and got to roam the food stations. n nNone of the food stood out as particularly amazing, but I'd have to say that the highlights were probably the brie and bacon macaroni and the prime rib. I was in a breakfast mood so I also tried the eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and a crepe. The bacon and sausage were good, but the scrambled eggs were way watery and had a very odd consistency. The eggs benedict was pretty good, but it seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. n nHowever, we were a bit disappointed when we had been sitting at our table for about 15 20 minutes and our server told us that they had completely run out of champagne. How do you run out of champagne for a champagne brunch? That made absolutely no sense to me. They offered us wine after a while, but I was really looking forward to the champagne.boo. It would have been nice if they had comp'ed us something at least. n nIf you do decide to come here, I'd come early so they don't run out of champagne on you. If you're going to do multiple buffets while you're in Vegas i'd probably do this one first, because compared to the other buffets i've been to in Vegas Mandalay Bay and Bellagio , the quality of the food just wasn't there.",1
"Ive been here a few times since its attached to the casino flamingo where I sometimes stay sometimes i get a margarita to go, and other times I've chilled at the bar, i usually go for the ""Perfect margarita "" over ice along with some chips and salsa. i haven't tried any of the food yet. but the HUGE volcano nachos and the burgers seem to be heavily filling the tables when Ive come. n nThe restaurant has two bars the 1st ones in the front of the restaurant and there's a standing only little patio which is facing out to the strip. good for people watching and catching a breeze where the weathers nice. nthe 2nd bar is in the back of the restaurant by the stage projection setup n n For those who want a souvenir there's a gift shop the entry of the restaurant which sells glassware, margarita mixes, shirts,flip flops, hats etc. n n tip 1 there's a 2 4 1 coupon for their ""whose to blame "" margarita in the fun book they give you when you stay the flamingo. avg out 4 ea margarita! which u can drink there or get it to go! boo ya! n n tip 2 you get more margarita when u get it a to go cupppp ",2
"Every time I go to visit my attorneys nearby I stop into this place. Pizza in this town is hit and miss. I really avoid the Pizza Huts, Domino's, etc., so when I find I good pizza place, I want the world to know. The pizzas are artisan wood fired style and they are superb. Very authentic and tasty. The crust is thin with just the right amount of dough. They aren't very big but two people can share one for lunch.",2
"dont order food here, takes way to long to get food. drinks are over priced and it seems all they are trying to do is copy surrounding bars. they do have an awesome band that plays.",1
"This place is roughly a half way meeting place between Phoenix and Tucson, that why we chose to try it. I don't think we'll be back. n nWe went at 8pm on a Thursday night. We were the only group in the entire place and they had the TV blaring in the bar so it was pretty awkward. Like we were visiting someones house and they left us to entertain ourselves, while they watched TV in the other room. n nI had the prime rib sandwich and the first few bites were all fat. I ended up disassembling my sandwich and picked out all the edible meat. The rest of my family, a group of 6, didn't rave about their meals either. And this place isn't cheap, expect to spend at least 20 30 a person. n nThe staff was very friendly though",1
"I went with my cousins, my lil bro, my aunt and my mom. We got amazing service. It's hard to find a place to take four high energy boys where we can get great service, good food, and a great value too. I got a deal that included a large pizza and chicken wings. The pizza dough was well proofed with cheesy goodness and tasty sausage. The pizza isn't fancy or fusion. It tastes like good American pizza, the kind the ninja turtles would stop fighting the shredder over. And the wings were so tasty. And the were all wings and no drums, which any wing enthusiast would say are the best because they are most moist with more meat on them. And the ranch sauce was good too. I would normally save a five star for a restaurant that likes to push the culinary limits, but this place knows what they are doing and they are doing it great.",2
"Two months later and I'm still waiting for the car stereo case that came with the radio they installed, plus I spoke with Scott on 3 16 13 and he said he would look into it. Spoke to Kenneth yesterday and he had the negative attitude to tell me that a detachable stereo does not come with a case! That's like saying a the right shoe does not come without the left shoe. A company says alot about the people they employ, and while Scott is VERY good and knowledgeable, there are some individuals who need more training and customer service at this location. n nIts okay Sterling, I just sent Allstate a message, they will contact you and to fix he over spray. The last comment and FACT is if you would have done the job right the first time, you would not have a bad business review. n nI will update my experience whenever my truck gets fixed. Next month , next year.you tell me. Meanwhile I ""ll send corporate a message to follow up.",1
"By the time we got to TAO, it's already midnight. We were a bit worried because the lines pay line, glist vip were pretty long. So we asked one of the security guys were the glist line is and we were escorted to the vip line, so we didn't say anything. n nAbout 5 mins. later we were escorted by one of the security guys to the front, amazing. I thought I was always a VIP in the bay area, didn't expect this kind of treatment. We didn't stay at all in the line and of course people were hating us but all well. n nOnce we walked in, we excited to see hot Asian girls in the tub, we only saw one and she looks cold. We ended up exploring the place, it was pretty awesome. I'm just a tad disappointed because I felt we were back in the bay area scenes, it's was full of Asians. Oh well, the place was packed Tao played great sets of danceable tunes. n nTao is so dark, you cant even see what's in front of you. I'm just glad the staff were very nice, they guide us with their flashlight. And of course, wimpy guys took advantage of the situation, I felt hands grabbing my thigh as we walked past by. I actually felt sorry for those guys. n nAnyways, we ditched the main room and ended up in another room. My friend was then asked by security if we wanted a drinks and of course, we followed him. We thought he was taking us to a bar but ended being set up like in a Korean club. He brought us to a table full of guys. After a few minutes, we left, were not that desperate. n nEnded up meeting new friends and enjoyed TAO, we didn't purchased any drinks because our friends have bottle service. Don't forget to go to the second floor bathroom. It was cool, it's see through looking over the crowd but once you closed it, it's frosted. We called it a night by 1 30 AM. All of us can't stand the smoke can't breathe. It was pretty amazing for our first night.",2
"I can tell you they don't clean the equipment much at all, most of the staff is not helpful and bullshits too much, I have stood at the counter waiting while they talk, the tanning beds are down to one bed and is filthy, if they have time to BS they should clean the equipment, most of the equipment is older and not very well taken care of, the management should really do something, also busy and small, the golds I used to go to in a different state was excellent so not sure what the problem is here",1
Pretty pedestrian at the end of the day. I had the signature fried chicken. Popeye s kills this place. Pass and find something better.,1
"First time coming here for lunch after a meeting and I can tell you, it was no frills at all. We were with a big party and one person ordered a steak which came with a salad which the salad looked like it had been sitting around for a few days.needless to say it did not get eaten. It was that bad as I would not have eaten the salad either. n nThe Ribeye was cooked to order however the quality of the meat was not a good quality. I had some Chinese food and it was ok, I have had better. Overall this is not a place I will go back too since the location of the hotel has a lot to offer in the area. There are a lot of better places to eat around there and I will suffer through being hungry to drive to a place I know the food will be fresh and edible. n nThe rooms upstairs where the meeting are held are very nice and I am pretty sure we will continue to use this location once a month but as for food after the meeting, this cafe will not be on the list ever again.",1
"We were driving around the summit and saw the diner. Thought we would give it a try. When we walked in, no one smiled and said welcome or anything. We sat at the bar. The server came up, didn't introduce herself, and just said "" what do nyou want to drink "", that was it. n nWe ordered food, which was good, a little pricey and the presentation was lacking. It looked like the food was just thrown on the plate. n nI will give it a second try to check out their breakfast, but if the service and presentation stay the same, we will probably not come back. n nI hope the place heeds some advice from its customers. It's nice to have something local at the summit.",1
"I had a similar experience to Katherine F. I believe it was the same guy. At first, he seemed upset that I just wanted to buy a fresh brewed cup of tea, imagine that! Then I asked for Green tea, he asked ""What kind? "". So I asked him what kind they had and he said ""Well we have hundreds of teas, you can chose one of the many in green "". Fine, I chose a Jasmine and his response ""Oh well if you want that one, I recommend the higher quality blah blah "". Instead I decided I wanted one of their Earl Grey teas, to which he responded ""Why would you want Earl Grey "". I chose to ignore this as I had my 9 mth old strapped to me at the time and finished my order. n nI will say the woman who served me the tea and operated the register was very nice and friendly. However, the other guy needs a serious education in customer service to him",1
My wife and I have visited Barro's several times since it opened and we have had carryout on several occasions. I love their pizza and my wife has had their ravioli several times. Definitely a great place to eat and a great addition to Laveen.,2
"Craving a slice of NY pizza and you live in Vegas? I think we all agree, this place is IT! Some may complain it's too far from the strip or from Summerlin. Trust me, it's worth the drive. Why didn't I give it a 5 star? Because, I've had NY pizza and nothing comes close to that. Go get yourself a slice. n nAnd if you don't care what your thighs will say after you've devoured a pint of creamy ice cream then head on over next door. I don't remember the name . They have great lucious creamy ice cream. yum!",2
"Less than good here, not terrible, but I see no reason to come back. n nChicken yakisoba was really boring. The chicken had zero flavor, it didn't taste seasoned at all or marinated. It tasted like a plain grilled chicken thigh. The noodles were lifeless, no flavor and mushy. The dish had no flavor. It was noodles, veg and chicken but nothing else. n nOrdered an egg roll, it was mushy. One bite and that was it. n nAlso, I guy in wheel chair had no place to sit. This place has 4 rows of booths and no place for a wheel chair. A little inconsiderate.",1
"Soltani plate is pretty good. I'm Persian , so it's not a Persian plate but definitely is delicious . In the market , you can find all kinds of Mediterranean spices , food , and other stuff.",2
"I would give this place 6 stars if I could. The food is truly exceptional. Prices ain't cheap but it's absolutely worth the splurge. n nWe had n n Fattouch salad was superb. Everyone was ready to lick the plate clean n Kibbe Nayye was delicious and totally fresh. A perfect place to try this classic dish n Hummus lahme was the best hummus dish I've ever had. It will ruin you for all other hummus n Grilled sea bass was fantastic and a good balance to all the red meat we were eating n Fattet makdous was probably the standout among a litany of extraordinary dishes n nThe only dish that didn't totally wow us was the Fattet Mozat. It was good, but just not as excellent as everything else.",2
"I just got a to go calzone to bring it home and find canned, sour mushrooms in it. It is absolutely mind boggling to me that a restaurant uses canned mushrooms for anything these days, especially as a topping for pizza, calzones, etc. Nothing appetizing whatsoever about this. Plus, my immediate thought after is ""what else are you trying to save a penny on? "" Take pride in your food. You're a restaurant. Its ALL YOU HAVE.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by Magnolia's. It doesn't look like much, but we had a great meal there. The Four Queens gave us a buy one get one entree coupon for signing up for their players club, so me and my boyfriend each got the ""fried neptunes platter "". Whoah. It was A LOT of food. Two large fried fish filets, two large crab cakes, three large fried tiger shrimp, mashed potatoes, salad, tartar sauce and some other chipotle esque sauce. It was very yummy and a really good value. We stuffed ourselves and couldn't finish our meal. Service was also very friendly. If you want some casual seafood on the fly, check it out.",2
"I get it, it's retail . Staff wants to look their best and be posh at fashion square mall. We all get it. Dressing attendant was beyond clueless and did not want to help find sizes. Cashiers did not take off censors for my clothing and other customers . All items were dropped numerous times. n nShopping is suppose to be fun and relaxing for most. Not here! Frantic skittish and stuck up staff yikes. I'll try to find another location asap!",1
An old hotel that smells like car freshener. n nThe end.,1
"Waited for 2 hours for an exam . I understand emergencies happen because if I were that patient I would want the same treatment . Unfortunately their staff did not make me aware of situation . When I was finally seen I knew I had an infection due to the swelling . Dentist reassured me that I had no infection and just needed a new crown . They were quick to call me after I left to tell me they could get me in immediately , oh and the price would be 1000 . 24 hours later with a fever I was able to see my primary dr who then put me on antibiotics till I could see another dentist . nNew dentist was very attentive and did tell me if I did need a new crown it would ONLY be 675 regardless of all porcelain . nConclusion was to see a specialist to make sure my tooth was not cracked because that new crown would be purposeless . nI'm so glad this new dentist actually cared about me as a patient not as a dollar amount . nEnd result no crown needed because implant is needed . Needless to say I definitely would not recommend this place . nSave time , money and pain .",1
"Growing up, fondue has always been a tradition on Xmas Eve, something my mom reminded me and my dad when we were contemplating where to go after church on Saturday. I've been there before and knew that they give you A LOT of food so I recommended we get a Wisconsin Cheese Trio and one entree that comes with a salad . We ordered drinks and waited. And waited. The waiter finally came out with the cheese plate after I hit the hostess stand for some candy to get me by. The cheese was excellent, especially with the bread. I was temporarily mollified with cheese and waited for the next course Land and Sea . And waited. A person brought out a dirty pot and assumed that was an acceptable way to serve a very expensive entree. I asked for a new pot and another person felt it was acceptable to wipe the pot with a dirty rag. Rolls eyes. The meat was good but not as much as it was in the past. No dessert and we still rolled out of there full. I was advised not to complain bad karma and left quietly. Will not be back. Hopefully a competitor of Melting Pot will hit the Las Vegas scene. There were a few back in my hometown of MI that were just as good.",1
"OK rooms, a bit smaller then most hotels. The service is terrible! We called ahead of time to ask if the have mini fridges in the rooms. They said yes, so we book it. Come here and see here isn't. We go downstairs and rudely the man said uhh no the cheap rooms don't have mini fridges the expensive ones do. I didn't know that MGM is cheap in general? Huh, okay then! nThe pool is over crowded and it's really small considering the size of the hotel. There are 3 pools 1 is river rafting which you have to rent, the others are two small pools that is overcrowded. Also the food, and drinks here at the stores are crazy prices! 5 for 1 bottle of soda? Are you kidding me, this isn't an island where you expect it to be really expensive. Overall I did not enjoy this hotel the riviera monocoa suites are better then here. This was first time at MGM and I am not happy about the service and hotel here. I will be giving my complaint to management here.",1
This place has NEVER gotten our order right. Not once. Lame.,1
Try the potato cream cheese bread bowl or chicken pesto sandwich. Then relax in Changing Hands afterward.perfect date night!,2
"This place makes no sense.you walk in and there are servers, but there is also pick up window, also a register where you can order food. Do I sit down or order at the counter? I ordered at the counter, 10.00 for a bagel sandwich and fries seemed a bit high price. There are no lunch specials or combos. I ordered the roast beef on a jalape u00f1o bagel They call this a jalape u00f1o bagel. Are you kidding me? food was meh. There is also a bar in back where you can order drinks. At a bagel shop? This place is just going in way too many directions for me. I don't recommend this place at all. Gave it 2 stars instead of one simply cause the food wasn't all that bad.",1
"sorry. my least fav of the Michoacan restaurants. Love love love the original one on Desert Inn. The one on Decatur is good, and like the one on Flamingo. This one is not up to par. it is the closest to my house, but I will drive to another location because this one is just not the same level of food. nService is good, thats why I am giving them the 2 stars, and the chips beans and salsa are good no matter what location you pick. nI have eaten here 5 or 6 times, just not the same as the other locations.",1
"Always has what I need, friendly staff. Clean restrooms. a cool place to hang while deciding if the read or mag is worth it over a nice cup of coffee.",2
"Always packed, great beer selection, and the food isn't too bad either! The 2nd best beer bar on the strip! Surprisingly they had a few Cask Ales to choose from, which is a rarity within the Las Vegas area. so naturally, with that enhancement, it bumped it up from a 3 star to a 4 star. n nI would very much like to see some more promo's for the locals however. the nickel beer night was a huge hit. but they unfortunately got rid of it ",2
Usually a good place to eat. I generally pop in on occasion for breakfast. Today I needed to get breakfast so I could give blood this morning. I arrived shortly before 7 00 and the cook was still not there. They open at 6 00. I left about 7 05 with no food or cook. They should just close for the day if this is their only cook. I did wonder why there were only three customers there when I arrived usually at that time of day.,1

"This is the 1st time I have ever wriiten a yelp reveiw, Ive used yelp but I never had a reason to write a reveiw. But today I just couldnt help myself. Found this salon by a groupon deal never used groupon before , but since im new to the area and needed a facial I figured Id give it a try. I paid 39.00 for a facial and a peel, which I thought what a great deal cus i usually pay 85 for somthing like that. Well the facial started at 11 15 and ended at 11 40 I COULDNT BELIEVE IT WAS OVER. During the 20 min facial i started to realize that not only was the the facial 20 min she was trying to sell me products to take home with me and wanted me to book 2 more 39 facials with her. I understand that this is a groupon deal and i got a deal but in the end i still need to go pay 85 to get a real facial . I COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER FACIAL AT HOME TO MYSELF. So as for groupon deals? NEVER AGAIN ! As for coming back to this salon ? NEVER AGAIN!",1
"Just ate here during our recent stay. The reviews on Yelp convinced me that we had to try this place. The view and the food were awesome. atmosphere was one of the nicest I have been to in the Phoenix area. Food was beautifully prepared and the kitchen was sharp enough to split our appetizers between two plates for my wife and I nice touch . We ordered the scallops and a salad for appetizers. We ordered the Filet Mignon and the Venison dishes for entrees, both were excellent. Place loses a star for the service. The host and the reservation people were very accommodating, even with a last minute change in plans. However, our server was slow and not very attentive. The bus staff was prompt to clean plates and refill drinks, but server was slow with food and extra slow for drinks. would have likely ordered a couple more drinks, if he had kept them coming at a good pace. n nWould definitely recommend this place for someone looking for a romantic dinner spot in the Phoenix area.",2
I'll take this place over Chipotle any day. The Carnitas burrito is the best.yummy good.,2
"Tucked away inside the Crystals mall, it's a great little joint to try after a full day of shopping! n nWe came here for lunch and it's pretty hard to find especially being next to Wolfgangs. The sign is super small so if you're looking for the place, it's right in front of Stella McCarthy. n nWe opted for the prix fixe lunch menu since it seems like the best deal to get. I ordered the seafood ramen, spicy tuna roll, and salad. The bf ordered the loco moco, salmon roll, and salad as well. n nEverything was delish! From the salads to sushi to entrees, everything was very good! I especially liked my seafood ramen. It had a very good broth to it. Hot and flavorful. The loco moco was good as well. Their gravy was good and a good meat patty to their rice. n nService was top notch too. Out waiter was friendly, fast, and very attentive. n nOverall, I had an awesome lunch here at Social House. The prix fixe menu is definitely bang for your buck! More than enough food for 20 a person! n n nNext time, I definitely want to try their dinner menu or happy hour!",2
"My review is solely for the desserts at Serendipity I can't even remember the last time I ordered real food here ! n nWe mostly come here for the frozen hot chocolate, which is a steal if you check in on foursquare free frozen hot chocolate with any purchase of 10! So last time, we decided that our 10 purchase would be a cheesecake I know, a 12 cheesecake? We were pretty skeptical too, but we really weren't in the mood for much else. So lo and behold, our cheesecake comes out, and it is LITERALLY the HUGEST cheesecake I have ever seen. It could feed a family of 6. At least. There were 3 of us that day and we took over half of it home. And cheesecake is my forte too. It was seriously incredible, I still rave about it. Not just for its size either. The cheesecake itself was a lighter fluffier consistency than most, which normally would bother me, but it made it much more doable to eat a LOT of it. It also wasn't too sweet, which was perfect for me. The crust is a mac nut crust and though I prefer graham crackers, the nuts were pretty good too. Like I said though, expect to be taking most of it home or back to your hotel n nOh, and the frozen hot chocolate! That's always a must if you come to Serendipity, isn't it? Be sure you're sharing! Delicious and refreshing, chocolatey, just go try it, you'll see what I mean ",2
"Great Texas toast, incredible dipping sauce, fries are so so, the chicken is always cooked right, and the fresh lemonade is worth the visit alone. Walk up service, employees have always been polite. Bathrooms have always been clean.",2
"Torn is the best way to describe it. I'll just come out and say that I've been a Monta fan for years and probably always will be. Buuuuuuuuuut, I gotta say that Ramen Sora is right up there, and actually eclipses Monta in some aspects. Needless to say, you can't go wrong with either one of them, but let's just focus on Ramen Sora. I love hot stuff, so obviously I ordered the Screaming for Vengance. I gotta say, it was hot, but I've had hotter. Not saying that I wanted it hotter, but in my opinion, it was just enough heat to make you say.Damn! But not enough heat where you couldn't actually taste the food you were eating. I loved the texture of the noodles and the chashu was very tender and tasty. The gyoza was good, but I didn't like the fact that you didn't have the shoyu, vinegar, and chili oil on the table to make your own gyoza dipping sauce. Not a deal breaker, but I typically like the sauce more acidic than how their's was. Our friends ordered pork fried rice as well which was very tasty. This spot is super busy, and unfortunately since everybody waits inside, you can't help but feel rushed. At least at Monta's the long line is outside.hahaha",2
Wow what a new low.cold hash browns and a cold sausage biscuit.at least the coffee was hot! I still thing the manager needs to revamp her workers or fire them and hire some competent workers. I think I have a right to hot food. And fresh lettuce in my salads.and no food poisoning.,1
"Came on a Monday night, including our table there are only 2 3 other tables. Variety is decent, a lot of different cut rolls, but half of them are some sort of variation with cream cheese. Many items from the photograph were no where to be found. It has potential, but due to lack of customer, foods are dry, not fresh and salty.",1
The only good thing about this place was the price. The value is good.but you get what you pay for. The pizza was greasy and the sauce had no flavor. The wings had hardly any meat on them. My 5 year old only ate one piece and then said that his tummy hurt. He usually eats at least 4 pieces of pizza! We will not be returning.,1
"Worst experience! We sat down and our host had to come over 3 times before our waitress even came over. And come to find out the hostess was our server. Apparently some miscommunication between the staff. The place was dead and another couple that had arrived 10 minutes after us got an appetizer before our order was even taken. They were over staffed. We could see four servers stranding around talking. It took almost 40 minutes for us to get our food and it was terrible! Paid the bill and got out of there. My boyfriend spoke with the manager who was outside on his cell phone and he managed our concerns very poorly. Didn't even offer to take care of part of he meal or offer us some sort of deal to come back. Terrible service, terrible food. Never going back again!",1
"Been coming into Guido's since the late 80's. This ain't Chi town or NY or Philly, so get over it. It's Scottsdale and its the best Chicago Italian deli this side of the Illinois river. I haven't found another deli this side of town that is better. nFood is great. I've eaten everything on the menu. All fresh. Some things they make the night before but I can tell you for a fact that food does not hang around here for more than 24 hours. n I actually like the tuna sub. Of course, the bread makes the sammy. I always buy a loaf and some meatballs from the deli to make a pasta dinner for the family. nI'm not going to be pretentious and make recommendations. Go for yourself and see. nOh, and the owner always says goodbye to me when I get up and leave. nYea, that's a 5 STAR act in my book. nBADDABING!",2
"I wasn't a huge fan of the beef and broccoli, but their yellow curry was great! Generally I order 2 entrees and a soup so my lady and I have leftovers. But tonight, she was on her freaking own. I made that curry my prison bit. Well, you get the point. n nTheir service is always quick and the place is usually pretty dead. But their food is great overall and the people are really nice. This is an excellent off Chinatown Thai place.",2
"I went to Takumi for lunch with three other business travelers from Washington DC. I have been so many sushi places while traveling on business and this is among the best. n nLunch specials included two sushi rolls with either soup or salad for under 10. I had the Spicy Tuna and the Spicy Tempura Shrimp rolls with the Miso Soup. The soup was really flavorful and had lots of scallions and just the right amount of tofu. The sushi was REALLY good. The Spicy Tuna Roll was exactly what I expect in a spicy tuna roll a good mix of spicy, smoky, and umami. I tried the Shrimp Tempura Roll because I wanted something a little different from sushi I usually order, and it was great! It had a good balance of avocado and cucumber and it was nice and crispy. n nOur server was very friendly and helpful when we were trying to decide between a la carte options or the lunch specials. They don't have lite soy sauce on the table, but they'll bring some if you ask for it. n nOverall, good service and good food for a great price.",2
"How do you get excited about a dinner salad? Tomatoes that taste like tomatoes, cucumbers that are firm, carrot radish slices, a great blue cheese dressing. The Texas Speed Bump IPA pours like an Irish Cream Ale. Great place I will be back!",2
"This place is terrible. The customer service was absolutely the worst I've experienced in a long time. The people in the booth next to us shot a rubber band at us while eating and the waitress, Stephanie, laughed about it. I will NEVER come back to this place again. The food was decent, minus the fact that it took forever to get it and even longer to get the check.",1
"This was the worst experience in a drive through I have ever had. Although the customer care personnel were nice, every single order was messed up and I only had two orders. And I felt like it was extremely overpriced for what I received it. They forgot the tater tots they gave me a sweet tea opposed to green tea and my coffee was awful.

"I placed a 40.00 order and while I was waiting, I asked for one of their cheap dixie cups to get some water from the soda fountain. I was told ""that will be .30 cent "". At first I thought it was a joke and the counter girl told me ""the owner charges for everything "". n nThat is my last visit to this restaurant.

"When the folks I was traveling with said we were eating dinner at Planet Hollywood, I had to bite my tongue so as not to blurt out, ""You're kidding, right? "" n nI'd stopped into Planet Hollywood once before on a previous trip to Vegas back in 2001. I'm sad to say that the decor doesn't appear to have changed at all since my initial visit. which is downright pathetic since the restaurant was butt ugly back in 2001 and looks even worse now. The entire back wall of the restaurant looks like. like. The 80's. I know that's a very vague description but there's no other accurate way to say it. It's as if the Planet Hollywood designers took every tacky design principal from the 80's and applied it to a Hollywood mural of famous faces and classic movie moments. Trust me, you'll understand if you ever see it. But hopefully you won't. n nAnd not to go off on a tangent, but if you're creating a mural with pictures of Hollywood megastars, why the hell is there a picture of Tom Arnold?!? n nI had a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a few chicken tenders that were apparently coated with Captain Crunch. The food okay but in no way memorable. If you've ever wondered whether a meal would taste better if you were sitting ten feet away from a rifle used in ""Starship Troopers, "" the answer is no.",1
"To be fair, this is not my typical scene. But even if it's not, a good place should draw my interest, no matter its target clientele. Instead, the people working there are a mix of aggressive bouncers and airheaded bartenders. I was disappointed. Not only are their well drinks pretty pricey, but the music just plain uninspires. I spent a while on the rooftop bar and wondered why everyone was enjoying themselves. The DJ played the same boring, unoriginal beat 1,000 times over and over, yet people were eating it up. I think I'm not cool enough to understand. I heard they're under a new general manager, so maybe this place will get better. The space is great, but the atmosphere is such a bummer here that I can't be any kinder.",1
"Holy crap this buffet is overrated. Top 10 in vegas? NOPE! n nWe came here for lunch and it was about 32 a person. I dont mind paying the price but wow the food did not match the price tag at all! They have ready small plates trays for you to pick up to control food portion but wow that seems like a lot of dishes to clean! n nThe selection of food was very little. The food was just so so. From what I could remember, I tried their dim sum, sushi, tacos, mac and cheese, and salad. Also, having a complimentary drink was a nice touch but I would effeminately not come back here for lunch again. I wonder what their dinner has to offer? n nM resort has a way better buffet off of the strip and cheaper as well.",1
"Was a favorite spot but last night I ordered the sea bass entr u00e9e that is supposed to come with bok choy and rice. I've had a lot of sea bass and this was definitely NOT sea bass. There were a few pea pods and no bok choy and I'm positive the fish was tilapia. I've had this dish at least three times at Pure and know the difference. Added to that expensive fish substitute, a few hours later I was quite ill. Sorry to cross Pure off my list but it's not worth it.",1
"Sorry to anyone who likes this place, but The Keg is a big, fat disappointment just like the parties with the same name always were back in college. To be fair, we only went for happy hour, but the specialty drink we tried and the appetizer we ordered were both really gross. In my opinion, a restaurant needs to make a good impression at the bar because a lot of people, myself included, try places out by ordering a drink and appetizer or two. Given how bad what we tried was, what incentive do we have for returning for a bigger meal? n nFrom the outside, The Keg looks like your run of the mill steakhouse once we got inside, however, we were shocked at how sleek and upscale the decor was. The bathrooms, in particular, were gorgeous and super clean. When we went to sit at the bar, we were expecting some really classic cocktails and satisfying appetizers. The happy hour drink special was an orange martini, so I thought I'd try it. My husband got a Heineken 1 2 off during happy hour , which can't be messed up. n nTo eat, we ordered the sliders, which were 9.95 they didn't have any happy hour food specials. The martini was really sweet and tasted like it didn't have a drop of alcohol in it it kind of reminded me of Sunny D, which I hated growing up and now wouldn't serve to children if you paid me. The sliders were even worse. They were supposed to be prime rib sliders, but I would have rather had ground chuck. The meat was chewy and fatty and reminded us of the sausage in an Egg McMuffin which I like but wasn't expecting on a slider . There were also no toppings like onion or tomato just a sauce or piece of cheese on each one. Instead of fries on the side, there were just measly little fried onions. Blech. We could have gone to Ruby Tuesday's right next door and gotten better sliders! n nIn the end, we didn't spend more than 22 or so, but being a happy hour fanatic, I know that there are plenty of other places Latitude 30 is a notable example where we could go and spend the same amount and get some great appetizers and drinks. We definitely won't be back.",1
"The fun, colorful dining room marries well with Serendipity's selection of over the top food. A foot long hot dog? Yep, they have that. Massive sundaes and chocolate drinks served in goblets? Check. We sampled the strawberry frozen hot chocolate, mint frozen hot chocolate, red velvet sundae, chicken chopped salad, nachos, and heirloom tomato salad. Everything was very good. Of the savory dishes, my favorite was the nachos because the tortilla chips were so light and crispy. Of the sweet, I enjoyed the mint hot chocolate, though I thought it could use more mint flavor. Service is cheerful and prompt. Expect long lines and a wait, so try to make a reservation.",2
"Small, crowded, dark, dirty utensils, glasses, mugs, fly ridden during the summer, stuffy and stale during the winter 8 months people. 8 MONTHS! Espresso Royale sucks. You can't study in here.

"We came downtown for Food Truck Friday today to try and grab some lunch. Unfortunately, when we got there, a lack of cash poor planning , indecision, long lines and extreme hunger lead us to head to PPM where we could pay with a card and get served more quickly. Now I wish I wouldn't have been so hangry hungry angry and had waited for a Short Leash hotdog. n nWe walked a few yards to PPM and I stepped up and asked for a chino salad. The dude taking our order said they were in the case behind me. I thought it was weird that they would sell you already made salads when there were fresh sandwiches coming from the kitchen but I had never been so I assumed this was just the way they operated. n nWe sat out on the patio which I'll admit was nice and shaded. Phoenix is amazing in March and the weather was perfect. I opened up the salad and notice there is a huge pile of red bell pepper in the middle which wasn't listed as an ingredient on the menu. Not a big deal, really, but I happen to dislike bell pepper quite a bit. I just pulled them out and that was that. Again, not a deal breaker, but a little annoying. On the other hand, cashews which WERE listed on the menu were practically nonexistent. I think I found 3 pieces? Cashew are likely the most expensive item to purchase in the salad and thus, drive up the price of the salad overall. Very annoying. On the whole, this salad was plain, boring and could be made a thousand times better at home. n nTo add insult to injury, TWO people eating next to us order the same salad, but it was brought to them fresh, in a bowl, and one woman even had spinach added to her salad, which I didn't even know was an option. I can't speak to the number of ingredients in their food or the taste, but it was definitely fresh made and from the kitchen, not kept in a fridge and made ahead of time. n nNow, I realized that part of the issue was my ignorance to the way this place works so I didn't complain to anyone. I don't think I was treated poorly intentionally, but even if my salad HAD been given to me from the kitchen, I would have remained disappointed with the quality being what is was. I feel doubtful about going back which sucks because I really wanted to like this place and my food ",1
"I've only ordered from here, but have done it about 5 times now. The language barrier with the people who take your order over the phone makes it pretty difficult, but if you can get past that the Mongolian Beef is sooo worth it! I love that stuff! Its spicy and the grilled onions are amazing. I didn't even know I liked onions that much! nBut the eggrolls are greasy and just taste bad. I don't think you should have to cover them in sweet and sour sauce to make them good. Also one time I had the Kung Pao chicken and it wasn't even kind of special. I was bored with it and halfway into it looking for somethng else to eat. n nI don't know, maybe I shouldn't give this place such a good review then, but the rice and mongolian beef make me love getting food from here",2
"We made a stop at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort for lunch and ended up at the Ironwood American Kitchen. n nPros n nNice setting, we sat on the patio with a view of the pool. n nGood service. n nLiked that they left big bottles of water on the table since it was close to 85 degrees during our visit. Nice touch. n n nCons n nFood was so so. We ordered two different salads and neither was remarkable. They told us they had just gone to a farm to table concept. I guess that's why the servers all wear jeans. n nAt lunch we were presented a cocktail menu where our server pointed to the limited selection of cocktails they could make during the afternoon. We ordered two different margaritas. One was their regular, the other was the special. Neither were good. n n nMaybe it would be a better place to try for dinner. They could do a much better job on their lunch menu and food preparation.",1

"I went to the ""grand opening "" of this new cafe a while ago. Announced, the opening was to be at 4 p.m. that afternoon. However my friends and I stored by around 2 30 to check it out. Lo and behold, there was huge line already and all seats were taken. My friends proceeded to order some bubble teas, some other drink and bingsoo shaved ice . To their disappointment, the item, that I can't remember at the moment, and the bingsoo were not for sale but were listed on the menu and were being promoted. After waiting in line for almost 15 minutes, the bubble teas that were ordered could not be fulfilled.they had run out of tapioca pearls. Instead, my friends just took the bubble teas, without the bubble. I proceeded to taste the tea and it was absolutely disgusting. If I could guess, I would say that their recipe for bubble tea called for 60 ice, 30 milk, and 10 artificial flavor. Not only did the tea lack authenticity, there was just not enough flavor in general. The ambience of the store itself was decent, however looks can be deceiving. If you are like me and dislike the food service, but enjoy the interior design, be prepared to leave. This store, again, lacking in an authentic cafe feel, is in search of the green stuff hanging out of your wallets rather than being there to serve a nice coffee signs everywhere discourage hanging around if you have no motive to buy anything. WI FI is also something that you have to pay for.the password on the network changes everyday and will only be available on a receipt. n nI honestly disapprove of this cafe opening up around the area. With a competing local chain cafe and an independent cafe within a quarter mile, I'd rather head to either of those. The quality of service, drinks food, and setting far exceed that which Caffe Bene provides. Go check Espresso Royale or Caffe Paradiso out. Don't waste your time at Caffe Bene.",1
"Most horrible buffet I have ever been to. n nMy boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right . so the prospect of a good buffet at 5 8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes. n nDear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner. The only thing I remember being remotely food like was some kind of beef and onion dish. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare. n nI tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles. so they've got that going for them. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha. n nIn short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage.",1
"I have been working near, and eating at Haba's for fir years now. In my office we tend to eat here at least one a week. Not only does it always impress, but it never gets old. n nAsk the food is prepared fresh using traditional methods and spices. Everything they serve its hot, fresh, and large in proportions. They don't have fountain drinks, which is fine since my food it's often to go, and the choices are plentiful. n nThey just opened a second location near my house, it's dangerous for my wallet n nSince I've found this place I've not been back to Chipotle out Qdoba.",2

"I stopped by here on Saturday during the day to scope out the menu. Was 100 empty at 3 30. I sampled yeah that's right. i cheated! hardly ever happens one of their tortillas and was hooked. Small kitchen in the back staffed by some nice Mexican ladies. Smelled great. total dive type place. It had success written all over it. n nThree of us pull up at 7pm ready to stuff our faces. The parking lot is packed which has to be a good sign. Walk in and are confused. Do we ordered at the window? Sit down and wait? wait to be seated? After about 5 minutes I flag a lady down and ask. She asked if it was take away, I let her know if was to stay she told us to take a seat and she would be with us shortly. n nAfter viewing the reviews pictures the first thing I ordered were the chips and a cheese crisp with guacamole. The chips and salsa and water hit our table right away and the CC zoomed out less than 5 minutes later. Sadly this is where the speediness stopped n nAnytime we needed something after that point we had to flag someone down and ask. sometimes twice. Its not that they were lazy its that their were only two of them serving a really busy restaurant. This is no fault of theirs but a fault of management. Staff your establishments accordingly! A Saturday night rush cannot possibly be ""news "" to this place. It was obvious this was the norm. n nWith empty drinks chips we watched and waited as food slowly trickled from the kitchen. 45 minutes and our food finally showed up. It was fresh so we had not been forgotten about. They were THAT busy for the size of the kitchen. Another ding for the restaurant management. n nannnyywayys. I believe I can separate my feelings on management service food so onto the food n nchips hot mild salsa nSuper tasty! The chips had a very pleasant corn flavor, fresh, and far from greasy. On first glance I was sure I was going to hate the regular salsa. I'm one of those weirdo's that likes tomatoes everyway but fresh and it was loaded. I tasted it and prepared for the cringe. NONE! it was really good. Not sure what they did to remove whatever it is about the fresh tomatoes i hate but they did it. The ""hot "" sauce in the bottle was also very good, standard chili, garlic, Mexican oregano that you find at most places. All three of them were addictive and I was almost happy we never requested a refill. n ncheese crisp nDelicious Tortilla check , Super Sexy Cheese Blend Check , Crispy Check , Foldability MASSIVE FAIL . DOH! If you read my review on la pi u00f1ata you will see me talk about this. This happens when you try and slightly fold and overly crispy cheese crisp to maximize guac salsa capacity. Snap! you try and recover SNAP! Now your hands are covered with grease and salsa and you have this crazy folded discombobulated mess on your plate see attached picture. I have to believe you all know what I'm talking about. Still tasty. n nguacamole nThey at least have the ""avocado is the star "" aspect of this down but it was lackluster. There are some supporting ingredients that really help bring out the creaminess fat flavor of the avocado. It lacked citrus, salt, flavor in general. At least it wasn't 3 4 tomato n nshredded beef taco nIt was decent but nothing amazing. They weren't stuffed and then fried which I believe makes a superior taco. Something was overly wet as after two bites it fell victim to taco shell failure. Bottom falls out and you ended up finishing it with a fork. The meat could have definitely used more seasoning. n nground beef taco nOnly difference here was ground beef and had much more seasoning. Standard large amount of chili powder cumin. n ngreen corn chicken tamale nWOW! The comments about these are dead on. Really good even nekkid. Moist with just the right sweetness and corn flavor. I could have had a plate full of these and probably wanted more. n nchile relleno nThe pepper was bland, the cheese was a little scarce but at least melted and warm. You can tell the batter was at one point fluffy and light but in a short time ended up a soggy mess. Covered in green sauce. n ncheese enchilada nAmazing cheese with a small spin of adding onion which I liked the combo. This was covered on red sauce. n nSauce nRed Above average, nice fat content and good roasted pepper flavor. nGreen No real heat, spice, or even chile flavor. I was disappointed because a few people mentioning how amazing it was. n nPros nCheese nTamales nChips Salsa nReasonably Priced n nCons nHorrible Service Due to understaffing nBland This isn't uncommon for Senoran style but this was excessive. n nSummary nWhen I have a craving for tamales and delicious tortillas I will be back. Anything else I will likely head elsewhere. If there is something amazing there that I absolutely have to try please let me know! So out of 10 items the group really only liked 2 with a possible 3rd. Maybe it was an off night but I can't give this more then a 2.5 based on our experience. I really wanted to love this place ",1
"This has to be one of THE WORST pizza huts in charlotte! n nI absolutely HATE ordering from this place. The customer service stinks and the delivery people always take their time. It's better to just go to the store yourself and get behind the counter and make your own pizza, because that seems to be the only way you're going to get your pizza in a timely manner. n nNo really, it's better to go to the store and order, because calling them on the phone is like a hit or miss. I have to call on AVERAGE 9 times before I can get my order through. I found out I have a friend who works there, so I text them to see if they're working, and if so, I put in my order through them. Now that is so GHETTO! Just like the whole restaurant. I should NOT have to do that, just to order some pizza. n nIf you reach someone on the phone, IF THEY ANSWER, 8 times out of 10 they will hang up on you, or put you on hold for 15 mins or more. I absolutely hate this Pizza Hut. They should close down, hire new workers or something. It's like they're so lazy and customers ordering is a game to them.",1

This is through Amazon when using their Prime service. Maybe there is just a single truck or something? Or maybe this is a bike messenger service? Whatever it is, they definitely do not have the customer in mind. n nAnother irritating thing is that when you go on Amazon to track your order, it shows that it is ""Out for Delivery "" and that is it. The next day, the same thing. I called Amazon and they refunded my shipping and contacted the company to find out where my merchandise was.guess what. n n ""Out for delivery """,1

I never wanted my hair to be shorter, just blonde with a normal trimming! She let the bleach sit on my hair for about 35 40 mins.

"Expensive service moves at a glacial speed. They have no wheat free soy sauce so the ridiculously overpriced sashimi plate 15 pieces of fish for 42 had to be eaten with no sauce. I asked for a side of rice didn't come with the meal was willing to pay the additional 3.50 or whatever it was BUT they informed me the rice has wheat in it. Huh? I was told the vinegar they add to the sushi rice had wheat in it. I asked for plain steamed rice. Sorry, not possible. You gotta be freakin kidding me. We are sitting in the middle of Mandalay bay it is not possible to have steamed rice?!? Go figure. We ordered 2 sake. Never had it before. The apple lychee flavor ones. Dont know much about sake but these were so sweet it made the mouth sick. Husband had the bento for 17. Not a bad deal. Fish is quality but skip this place based on the price alone if you can get quality sushi sashimi at home. We live in Seattle. Need I say more?",1
"We went here for dinner this past labor day weekend, and all I can say is that ALL four of us were majorly disappointed. We ordered the halibut, short ribs, salmon, and their signature smoked salmon pizza, and not one of them was even remotely impressive. If anything they were below average. The salmon pizza had too much lox on it, and looked more like a smoked salmon party platter for bagel day at work. The salmon was a little burnt and completely smothered with some kind of teriyaki sauce. The short ribs I didn't try, but from the others who did try it, it definitely wasn't a winner either. My halibut was decent, but presentation sucked. When it came out everyone started laughing at my dish because it looked like the fish was sitting in a pool of foamy soap. I wish I could say better things for this Wolfgang Puck establishment.but the story ends here. I think the only plus side to this restaurant was that the decor and ambiance was able to lure us into one of the most pitiful dinners I've had in a long time.",1

He has tried every noodle dish on the menu, but keeps coming back to the Chicken Pad Thai. I find the vegetable panang to be very authentic, and sometimes it is spicier than other times but I always love it.

"This spot gets it right! nThe restaurant itself is nicely decorated and sparkling clean. You order at the counter and then choose your seat. I was SO excited to find out they are dog friendly.it gets better.the patio is not only beautiful see pic but it's AIR CONDITIONED! We had breakfast with the 130 puppy and it was very comfortable even with it being 100 degrees outside. nNow the food. The first time I had the special quiche. When it arrived I was concerned about the small portion, but once I tasted it I realized great food can come in small packages. You can order more than one if needed, but one was just enough for me. It was served with fresh spinach. nThe second time we dined, I ordered the Bagel and Lox. It is served as a sandwich, I normally like mine served deconstructed so I can build it. It comes with a delicious caper cream cheese. I ended up taking the top of the bagel off and asking for extra cream cheese to eat it open faced. nThe coffee here is good and local. They really make an effort to use local products and you can even buy some great items at the register. nThey deliver breakfast, lunch and dinner. I hear they are getting their liquor license in early July. That will make this place 6 stars for me!",2
"The first time we went it was amazing but we paid 55 dollars a plate for pasta, the next time was ok but very inconsistent we got the same dish and things were missing on my dish when we complained they were very rude. we decided to try it one more time and I got my dish and my lobster tail was completely raw inside so once again I had to complain they took the dish back to cook the lobster and once again were very rude I will never go back the serving size is large but if you want to split a meal they charge you a 20 dollar fee",1

"This review comes really late, but I feel compelled to write about my experience with the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! My husband purchased an hour long deep tissue massage, it was the last one of the day so that we could go and have dinner, gamble and go have some fun in the casino afterwards. The massage itself was good, nothing amazing but good. nHere is the beginning of the bad.It was a little uncomfortable when the masseuse tried to sell me add ons aromatherapy etc and when I refused he actually huffed like he expected that I would be so cheap nothing at the hard rock spa is cheap need I remind anyone , and then he cut my massage short by about 10 min because he said that they were closing and they needed to get things cleaned up. nOf course I was upset, but Im not good with confronting people especially when not clothed! nSo I gathered my things, and went to sit in the jacuzzi tub before my shower. nHere is the rest of the bad. nThe staff neglected to tell me that the spa was closing right after my massage, MEANING CLOSED TO EVERYONE.I didnt know that it would require me to quickly get clothed and get out! nI had oil all over me, in my hair, and they wanted me to leave! If I had known this I never would have booked the last tx of the day! We were supposed to have dinner at the steakhouse and I didnt even have time to fix myself! nAt this point I refused to leave without at least taking a shower, but come on girls, who goes to hang out at the hard rock on a fri night without doing your hair, makeup etc? nI was SOOOO Mad, and they didnt even care or bat an eyelash that I was paying for my service and they were SHOO ING me out as I was buttoning up my clothes. The girl at the front said I could use the bathrooms in the casino to finish getting ready! nAre you kidding me? I had to walk thru the casino with wet hair, no makeup, and use the public bathroom to try and fix myself! Needless to say, it ruined my evening. nI WILL NEVER GO TO THIS SPA AGAIN, AND I WILL TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE!",1
"It has been over 8 years since I have been back to Madison and I hit Lao Lann Xang on my first night. I always liked the bright red neon sign! n nI remember this place in the late 1990s as a very cozy place. The decor has become more open and less interesting if you ask me. This said, the food was as I remembered it. I had the Monday night Tofu special and was happy with it. The ""native "" spice level is as hot as I remember it and overall I felt that making the special effort to eat here after nearly 10 years away was worth it. n nMy only complaint is that they close at 9 Monday at least and stop taking orders well before this. I always had problems in Madison getting top notch food after 8 30 and I wish the best places really were ""open "" till 9. If it is after 8 pm call first. n nWhat a gem!",2
"I am no wedding expert, but these folks have a rather questionable business practices. I was in Vegas being a groomsman, one of their agents was pulling business at the Marriage Bureau at competing low price for 50 including everything, the bride fall for the deal, and then they proceeded taking you to their suite with two rooms and one being the chapel. n nWhen we arrival at our scheduled time, their story took a 180 degree with additional hidden charges including the things like the use of their chapel, attendee's picture taking rights, since the original offer only include a minister and few pictures taken by them . I guess they figure people are blinded by love before weddings willing to be price gouged. We proceeded doing a very simple ceremony at their very simple front room with many extra clutters nearby. n nAfter the ceremony started, the minister asked everyone's religions, which created a moment of awkwardness. The ceremony went without any Christian references. I guess the owner lady was pissed at us for being cheapskates not falling for her money traps and assumed we are Mormons since we came from Utah. She started lecturing us on how Mormons are not Christians, and proceeded to describe true Christianity to us sounding a lot like Jehovah Witness scripts, but we did not turn it into a religious debate, since all of us just wanted to get out of there. n nTheir last attempt to gouge money was a large tip for the minister, and an 80 dollar fee to apply the state issued marriage license for the newlyweds. We did check at with the Marriage Bureau around the block and it only cost 15 to do so. Perhaps they should name themselves ""Vegas Simply Money Gouging Wedding Chapel "" instead.",1
Came in for appetizers and snacks at 4pm. Beautiful restaurant. Empty since it was in between lunch and dinner. n nWas greeted by the manager Aaron. Was very polite and welcomed our party. Made us feel at home! n nWe ordered the onion soup amazing! tacos and sliders. Every single appetizer was amazing. But the standout was the onion soup. n nI definitely want to come back here for a romantic date. Thanks Aaron!,2
Tried to eat here about a month ago and there was a sign on the door saying they were closed for good. Haven't been back since to see if that is still the case.,1

"This place gets a bad rap at times, but honestly they are solid Doctors office. I've been going here for the past 8 years so I've been with them throughout the transition from being appointment only to accepting walk ups. I agree the dynamics have changed but it's still just as good if not better than other practices in the area. Typically, I make an appointment before I come and YES just like most other doctors' offices your appointment isn't a guarantee that they will timely. Sometimes they are right on time sometimes I've had to wait 30 minutes. Today I went as a walk in patient and was seen and released within the hour. I would definitely recommend that existing patients take advantage of the walk in system as opposed to going to urgent care which will cost you more than double. Yes, this place is VERY busy, but I consider it organized chaos and all of their doctors and nurses have been there for years which speaks volumes to the quality of care you will be receiving. As a bonus, there is a blood lab onsite, so you won't need to go anywhere else for blood work.",2

"Stopped by here after a late night of casino hopping. I wouldnt say it's the best chinese food ever, but it did the job especially for late night. Plus that it opens til 3am.",2
Food poisoning nEating here on Saturday ruined my night and ruined my Sunday plans. not to mention i had to fly back on sunday. never again.,1
"Second time here the chef and serving staff are friendly and the food is fantastic. n nFirst time I had the Eggs Royale which may be the best Benedict I have ever had the salmon was perfect texture and flavor, and the hollandaise matched well with the perfectly poached egg. I had a milk chocolate tart for dessert and took a croissant to go, delicious! n nThis time I had a breakfast croissant with hashbrowns incredible! I also had the lavender vanilla green iced tea which is super tasty. Taking a salted caramel eclair to go so I can't comment on its flavor yet but I doubt I will be disappointed!",2
"Kimberly a former employee from Diva Salon is a joke! She is currently the ""manager "" at Alexus Lounge A Salon. I was a former employee at this horrible place where manager's and owners do not know anything about running a hair salon. I would like to start off by saying that a former employee was hired and then was let go for personal dislike reason because of the fact we are friends. Apparently this lady Kimberly has the nerve to say that I did not know what I was doing and did not know how to cut hair correctly! What a joke! From personal experience, this place is a disgrace to the salon industry. If you are considering to work here don't think you are going to be in a professional environment. If you wonder why the salon is so slow and empty she is just one of the reasons why. This salon industry is so small that saying negative remarks of former stylists that have been in the industry isn't making you or the salon look good. Don't be fooled by a beautiful salon with fancy furniture and decor.",1
"Let me first say, I haven't made up my mind if I like the Pier 1 concept. It's not Crate Barrel, nor Z Gallerie, nor Cost Plus World Markets, and not even West Elm. n nYet, it has a little of each of these stores at a slightly higher price and, that's the problem I stop here every so often and all it does is give me ideas for something else at one of their above competitors Wine glasses, rugs, furniture, you name it. Sorry!",1
"This is one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Super thick under cookef dough, barely any toppings. Ridiculous to even call this pizza! Never ordering from here again.",1
"Ask me my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I'll tell you Ichiza. n nYou wont find me visiting overpriced tourist joints on the strip and I'll rarely eat at a chain restaurant in some strip mall. That leaves the restaurants on Spring Mountain Rd. A gauntlet of goodness, teasing your senses with aromas of far away lands. n nI happened upon Ichiza a few years ago and it became an instant favorite of mine when dining out. Their authentic style and representation of the culture, service, variety and flavor in their dishes make this a truly enjoyable dining experience time and time again. You're greeted by bubbly young female employees and offered a seat in their small, yet inviting dining area. While the place is usually packed, it has never taken an unreasonable amount of time to land an open table. The menu caters to anyone from the conservative to the adventurous eater, so there's always something for everyone willing to try some far east cuisine. n nMy personal favorites include the beef tataki in ponzu sauce. You'd think twice about eating raw beef, but once the tart sauce tickles your taste buds, there's no turning back from popping these thinly sliced quality cuts into your mouth. n nAnother must get and not on the menu.it's on the wall by the bar is the eel kakiage. Visually, it's a gorgeous multi layered roll with stacked levels of textures and tastes making you say, ""I don't know what the hell I'm eating, but this is damn good and I need more of it. "" n nIf you've never eaten tongue, but always wanted to try, now would be the time to pucker up and give that cow a French kiss. Tender morsels of seasoned beef tongue dance on your palate like it's prom night all over again. n nFinish your meal with mango or strawberry mochi that melts in your mouth or grab a spoon and share the ever so sweet honey toast with your friends. n nLadies and gentlemen, Ichiza is food porn at its finest.",2
Pretty decent bus terminal with bathrooms and bus ticket machine for RTC. n nWas dropped off here from getting the bus in front of Excalibur to grab Megabus back home.,2
Went here for an Orange Julius. It was 3.50 for a medium and it didn't have any ice in it. It wasn't cold at all and definitely wasn't worth the money.,1
"The boyfriend and I work odd hours so we will make a stop here anywhere between 11pm 430am. n nThe service has always been awesome, and the food has always been good. Maybe it's the difference in shifts? n nI will agree to the greasiness, but that's kind of expected for a hole in the wall place. Our usual is the chorizo and egg burrito, like someone said its a good portion.",2
SO DELICIOUS! I can't wait to go tomorrow for their lunch special! It's like 5 dish and my favoriteeeees are black pepper shredded beef and xo green beans . oh my they are SO yummmy . i'm getting hungry just thinking about it! I think this is the best place for authentic chinese dishes in Vegas!,2
Went here before a cirque show. Prices and food were good. Best part of our experience was the amazing service.,2
"The fashions here tend to lean on the more the conservative side, classy, fashionable casual dress day wear. Sorry, no hoochie outfits here. Real feminine. Clothes in floral prints and pastel colors. It's almost borderline boutique store as they have their own clothing line and different designs and the stores are a small franchise so you are not going to find mass produced department store wear. n nPrices are very affordable, they always have some type of sale going on. I check the social media sites or email newsletter for them. More than likely when you enter the store their sales staff will also let you know what the sales are. I have found some unique necklaces and very cute for under 10 in their little clearance basket! n nSales staff has always been friendly, never pushy. Since Im always at The District, I've window shopped at this store quite a few times and have never felt unwelcome. When I check out, the young lady who always rings me up is always really sweet. n nFor a small place, the store is packed with merchandise from top to bottom. Oh also they cute outfits for little girls too! Mom and daughter coordinates. So cute!",2
"Worse than Harrah's that's including the time that I slipped in vomit and found our hallway splattered in dried puke that had clearly been there for sometime. n nThat's right. My stay with this ""resort "" managed to leave me more disgusted and humilated than that. n nI have been a guest at this hotel several times, as my parents own the ""timeshare "" through Hilton Grand Vacations. The rooms are nice enough, however the hotel is far from anywhere you'd like to go on the strip, and adjacent to Circus Circus. Gross. On my recent visit in March, it was difficult to get a cab. The taxi lines were very long, just due to the fact that this is a remote area about to become worse when the Saraha across the street closes. The food market is over priced and limited in its options. No bar or restaurant on the premises except out by the pool, and the hours are very limited. n nHowever, the worst of it was the awful high pressure sales tactics. I'd sat in on the time share presentation before, but never witnessed this kind of coersion in action. The conduct of both the first sales associate I dealt with and her manager were unprofessional, rude and as far as I am concerned did a good job of destroying my perception of the Hilton brand. n nI explained upfront that my circumstances had changed since August when I booked my trip, and I would be unable to purchase a time share plan that day. She acknowledged that few people actually purchase the plan, and the bulk of their business comes from current owners upgrading. She still took up two hours of my time, and seemed to take it extremely personally at the end when I maintained that due to changed life circumstances that were none of her business , I would not be purchasing that day. It degenerated into some truly insulting comments and questions from her. n nWorst of all, after the presentation I complained verbally at the customer service desk and at the check out desk. Both associates were professional, and said they would forward my concerns to a manager. I also complained in writing twice once in an exit survey given to me at check out and once in their online survey. n nHowever, I never received any kind of apology or acknowledgment from a manager. Any chance they had of getting business from me in the future vanished. I might have been able to overlook a couple of poorly trained employees. However, I assume their lack of contact is essentially endorsing the unprofessional tactics I was subject to. n nDon't stay here for full price it's not worth your money. Stay at one of the better appointed, more centrally located resorts on the strip. Don't stay here under one of their ""specials "" they will treat you like you ordered the lobster then failed to put out.",1
"Okay please tell me why it took literally 20 minutes to go through three people ahead of me in the deli department? I'm not one to leave bad reviews but walmart get it together. They are so focused on cutting costs that they don't even have enough he employees to staff the deli. Also, most of the express u scan lanes were closed? Why? They should have more open saves them money in labor. Stick to target.",1
"Great pizza! Definitely old school Italian style, the marinara is made with fresh tomatoes! If you are partial to American style pizza, this place may not be for you. Nice guys too. I wish they had beer on tap but it's cool that they let you bring your own. We will definitely come back next time we're in Vegas.",2
"Service was excellent. Ambiance is nice. There's outside dining too. Wait staff seem very knowledgeable. Decent wine list. Impressive cheese list. n nDinner started off with an amuse bouche of rib meat with red pepper cream on a crostini. It was a good bite. n nFor an entree, I had the filet mignon with bernaise sauce. The filet was super tender and the bernaise sauce was incredible. My only complaint is that the filet was cooked weird it went from medium well on one end to medium rare on the other end. I ordered it medium . n nFor a side, I had the truffle mac and cheese. Hands down the best truffle mac and cheese I've ever had. It was incredible. n nI will absolutely be eating here again.",2
Ok I used a Groupon and tried this place but totally not worth it. We left HUNGRY after spending 40. Who leaves a restaurant hungry. You know something's wrong if your doing that. This is totally not like Genki's. Only 3 little skinny rolls are on a plate for spicy tuna for 2 and not spicy at all. I asked for tea thinking its green tea but I got a Lipton black tea bag. isn't this a Asian restaurant they should have green tea. So any way if you are a very lite eater or a child this place is perfect for you. The sushi guys don't interact with you at all even though we were sitting at the sushi bar if you can call it that .,1
In for my iphone4S battery issues. I have now had 3 iphones in three months and the Iphone is doing the same thing all over again. I just spoke to Steven at the Apple Store and he told me this time that it was one of my Apps that was causing the problem. I asked him why I have had it replaced 3 times and he told me that the rest of his crew were idiots and did not know what they are doing! I was shocked by this statement. I asked to speak to another representative because this guy acted like I was crazy and all I want is a phone that works with no battery issues! What a lousy experience! This will be the last iphone I will ever purchase! What a nightmare. I am now looking at my 4th new one in a span of 4 months! Lousy product and terrible service by this Steven at the San Tan location. I am actually shocked since everyone else I have dealt with has been great! They need to get rid of this employee.,1
"This is surely a dentist's worst nightmare come true! There are so many different varieties of candies here, both new and old. There are tons of thigns that I could take home but so many things that I know I'd probably end up staring at maybe not eating. LOL. I have a tendency to do that with candy. haha. There are candy covered bugs. There are tons of hello kitty candies. I love their huge gummy bears. Those are perfect gifts, especially for kids who love to keep those things are just WOW look at that. That's awesome, rather than not eat them. And of course there are bulk candy items to take home with you too. Prices can be a lil bit more than at the Sweet Factory but their selection here is far more superb. YOU should be sure to check this place out when you're in Vegas. It's a fun time, even if you don't happen to buy anything. I have yet to see many people come in and NOT buy something though, even if it's a single piece or something that they haven't had since they were kids.",2
"I was served a cold 8.95 seafood Benedict and it was served 10 minutes after my family's meals. When I spoke to the server and then manager, they were extremely disrespectful and defensive. I've been coming here for years and have never had such a terrible experience. How sad.",1
"Pretty well decorated rooms with some very comfy beds. Not the biggest but they were definitely on the cleaner side for hotels in this class. The windows are terribly small but the view is great if you're facing the strip. You can see the fireworks from the TI Sirens show right in front of your eyes as long as you don't mind the loud explosions and bright nights. The casino is spacious and clean with a minimal amount of smoke in the air. Oh yeah, the show is pretty cheesy but the pyrotechnics are great.",2
"Disagree with post from 12 23 n nThis place is the closest to authentic you can find. The mole sauce is excellent and the patio in the warm weather is a great place to chill on a nice night. BYOB or go across the street pick up a sixer or two. n nThey will keep your beer cold for you, bring some wine and they will also mix up some sangria for ya!",2
"I feel like the lone dissenter, here, but the food at this place has been consistently terrible every time I've been in. Every 3 4 months I think to myself ""Well, maybe I hit them on an off day, last time. "" Stupid Craig Street and its convenient location! n nSeriously, though, even my grilled cheese sandwich tasted bad how do you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich? n nAnd their coffee is too weak. n nI agree with the person who said it's cute inside. I think that's why I've given them so many chances. But food that's just not that good combined with high prices means I'm not going back.",1
This is an average bar. They have the run of the mill drinks everything else there. The service wasn't bad.but it didn't impress me. I do like the fact that they have good local brews on tap. Other than that.you can find a better bar in Charlotte.,1
"Gut erreichbares italienisches Restaurant, wo man in einer guten Location gute Speisen zu einem guten Preis genie u00dfen kann. Von der Auswahl her ohne Bedenken weiterzuempfehlen.",2
"This was an awesome experience. The drinks were stiff the appetizers we had were deliciously prepared. Compliments to our server ""Irene "" as she was very well poised, humorous very well informed of the menu. We received exceptional service hope to return for another magical night.",2
Quick and friendly service! Great stop for a quick lunch break,2
"Omigoodness! My friend and I held our own competition between HnJ and BC. I read reviews of both places and after much research, careful review and taste, Hot n Juicy takes the cake.hands down! n nThe service here is awesome! I came in and put my name in to be seated. The lady told me how long the wait was, which was not that long, and I sat down and observed the others delve into their bags. Then when the time came for my friend and I to be seated, our waitress was right there ready to take our order. I asked some questions and she had answers to all of them. She was super nice and told me her honest opinion of some of the food. I decided to get what I got at BC to make a fair decision, so I ordered two pounds of the snow crab legs. One lb in medium and 1 lb in mild. My friend ordered 2 lb of crawfish in medium as well. And off she went to put our order. n nFrom the tome we put or order in, to the time our food was in front of me was probably around ten min. At BC it was linger and I had to check to make sure my order was still on the way. My friends food came out first. Luckily, she waited for mine to come out and then we began stuffing our faces. Holy goodness and juiciness! At BC, I had to fight to get to the meat and it wasn't as sweet or juicy, but not here. The crab legs were tender, sweet, juicy and hot! I had to slow myself down and savor the moment. I didn't want it to end. I also ordered corn, which was marinating in the sauce. So tasty! The corn itself was boiled to perfection, then sitting in the sauce was even better! Medium is hot if you dip the meat in it like I did. The waterworks began because it was a bit hot, but good. I dipped the legs in the medium then mild after a few. I ate some of the crawfish too and that was really juicy as well. Some of them were a bit small, but still yummy. Our lady checked in with us a few times and each time I had no words, but nods because I was so into my food, and my mouth was full. I was already eating with my hands, to speak with food in my mouth would be throwing manners completely out the window. By the end of our meal, I was ready to pass out. All worth smelling like garlic for the rest of the night and into the next day. n nThe place has an open layout. They have booths, tables and chairs. Flat screen tv's hang on the walls and they also play music. The noise level is pretty high, but that's to be expected. n nI will be back here! Some may not like it because you eat with your hands and all the sauce and juice is just popping and flying. But they do offer gloves and a bib. So not to worry. This type of stuff you miss when you're not there. How can you beat the service, juicy food and hip atmosphere? Well, you don't.",2
"It was my 3rd time coming to this salon. The staff is very nice and speak English. The salon itself is very clean, modern and the instruments sterilized. They offer liners for the pedicure foot tubs but charge 2 extra for that. The prices are very reasonable and you get 5 off if you pay cash. Parking can be tricky and the place fills up quickly. I can only imagine the weekends! I like to get there when they first open up at 9am on week days. It seems like the raving reviews are from appointment making regulars who specifically ask for Julie and Christina. I only ever had pedicures done by an older lady which were ok. The callus removing part was weak, I need to redo at home. The massage part is not great either, kinda awkward. But the way my toenails were shaped and the painted end result is what made me come back. Today I wanted to try out the gel manicure. I got the same lady to do both my pedicure and manicure. She doesn't have anybody asking for her, she seems to only be taking care of the walk ins which tipped me off but didn't have me alarmed. Why would her work be that much different from the other ladies?! Well, I was wrong! First of all it was hot as hell in there today. Yes, they have several fans but that's just hot air blowing around, turn on the air conditioner! My pedicure was off as well. Why was only one of my feet scrubbed with sugar and not the other? Why are the heels neglected when the lotion massage happens? The callus removing and heels scrubbing part is half ass at best. That's why I'm still searching for the perfect place. Seems like something is always lacking but I digress.I really don't like how my feet or my fingernails came out today. The lines are chunky and sloppy on both. 60 with discount plus tip is no chump change to me! As is I can only afford to do this once a month and I expect a better end result than what I got today! I wanted to try the more popular ladies but I'm not the appointment type of gal. I go whenever I can fit it into MY schedule, not the other way around.",1
"I usually don't do yelp reviews but this new husband wife business deserves a great review. n nThere's been a lot of comparison to the LA Kogi tacos so I had to try this new spot out. it looks like just another ma pa place from the outside. We were greeted by the wife. She served us complimentary chips salsa. By other reviews, we already knew what we wanted to order bulgogi burrito and bulgogi daejigogi tacos. Nowadays, everyone knows how the value of a dollar is slowly going down. And that is why the food was incredibly cheap! 5 for the burrito and 1.29 for a taco! WOW. we definitely got our money's worth! Quality of the food was great! the meat was marinated very well and tender. And they also give you the option of the kimchi on the side as it maybe overbearing for others or in the food itself. The portion of the food was huge but I still managed to eat it all! yea. it was that delicious! Later, the husband served us complimentary pork skewers! OMG! More tasty food and free? Don't mind if I do. And when they presented our check, they gave more complimentary food peeled sliced oranges. The total for 2 people was only 17. included 2 sodas, 2 huge burritos and 4 tacos. Seriously, we probably ate 30 worth of food! n nWe usually don't meet a lot of restaurant owners. The wife, Linda, was very nice and personable. She told us the history on how they opened up the place and asked where we were from. And, by the time we left, she greeted us by our first names. n nI am definitely returning back this week! they've got us locked in!",2
"I enjoyed my time at a different Postino location, so I was definitely glad to see one open right across the street from campus. Like others have said, it definitely has a different vibe than the other locations. That's to be expected, and trying to cram a trendy upscale winebar next door to a Subway and Panda Express wouldn't have succeeded so I'm glad to see that they are embracing the college town atmosphere. n nYou can expect the same stuff that any other Postino has an eclectic array of bruschetta, a wide variety of alcohol, and decent daily specials. Would I make this an absolute go to for dinner dates? Maybe, but I'd much rather go to the other locations for that. Where the ""Annex "" succeeds is being an awesome lunch spot. 5 pitchers from 11am 5pm? Yes, please. The bruschetta plates can be split between two people for a not too filling lunch, so enjoy the Annex for what it is a great place to mix it up for lunchtime, and a decent place for dinner.",2
Great experience manicure and pedicure! Kevin is very particular about his work and does a great job!,2
"This review is for the Buffet only and NOT for the Casino or Hotel Facilities n n Without getting into great detail I'll just sum this buffet up as ""PEDESTRIAN "" which isnt bad if you like mainstream. Its not the worst I've seen Terribles Primm Valley . n nOn the good side n n1. The staff was very freindly including the chefs asking if everything was ok and if I needed anything to just ask . n n2. The food they had that I tried was good Fried fish, collard greens, Italian sausage in tomatoe sauce wt veg, Tortilla pie. n n3. A nice looking carving station, though I didnt try any. n n4. A Stuffed Potato station wt BACON sauted Onions.BAAAA CON. lol n nOn the flip side n n No tartar or cocktail sauce for the fish in sight. n n The booth I was sitting in was uncomfortably tight, even under the table there were these poles I kept hitting my legs on. n n The deserts were just set out and there was nothing otherwise to keep them cool as a result the Coconut Cream pie was room temp and not dazzling at all. n n And other minor weirdness like the set up of the buffet wt the potato salad being wt the jello and fruit and not on the other side wt the salad bar stuff. n n The Price 10.88 for what was offered was kind of high in comparison to other buffets in the area. Though I was told if I went downstairs signed up for the Club Card I could get 3 off. This was very nice for them to offer and I passed only because I was hungry and had not eaten much of anything all day. n n nOverall I'd say if you were like me in the area and hungry and not in the mood to play around Go. n n However, in the future I'll be sticking wt Buffet of Asia up the road wt the Killer sushi bar The Main Street Station Casino Dwntwn Not affilliated wt any of these ""Station "" casinos.",1
"Just back from the Wicked Spoon.It's definitely the WORST buffet I've ever been for dinner. Incredibly long wait in Line Only to pay and then wait in a SECOND long line.about 1.5 hour wait. 35 per person.Server never came back to ask if we needed refills on our drinks.VERY LIMITED variety of food.

"As Amy has mentioned, the bagels here are as close as you will get to real New York bagels in Edinburgh. They're still not a patch on the real deal though but they're pretty tasty and much more firm and chewy instead of soft and fluffy like the ones you get in most other places. n nThis place also has a perfect location in Waverly Station making it perfect if you need a snack before or after a train journey. I'll usually get a tasty onion bagel before hopping on the train. Yum! n nStill quite standard in comparison to NY bagels but they will have to suffice until I can get my next trip over the pond!",2
"I must be honest, I was hesitant at first to try this place. I can't pronounce the name, I was sure that it was a glorified Panera. However, a friend of mine asked me to meet him there, so I obliged. n nWhen I first walked in, I loved the eclectic style that was everywhere with the mismatched furniture that all just effortlessly ""went "" together. The place was packed and so was the pastry display case. My mouth was watering as soon as I walked in. The sweet and savory smells that waft throughout the entire venue are irresistable. I had the portabella and leek soup with a hot chocolate. Incredible! The goat cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor that just made the soup so perfect and the hot chocolate was real chocolate with steamed milk. It is the kind of food you crave when you are looking for comfort after a bad day. n nSince that first experience, I do try to go back as often as I can. The salted caramel brownies are amazing and they even have the recipe online for people to try. This establishment really shows what true craftsmanship and quality should be like within the food industry and I always feel like their number one customer!",2
"Map shops are like burger joints I'm always interested. A good window display of old maps is guaranteed to catch my attention every time I walk past. n nAs such, this is a great map gallery. It's set up more like a workshop than a store, which only serves to increase its awesomeness. The owner is very friendly and knowledgeable we got into a fascinating conversation about Edinburgh architecture and the design of the Scottish Parliament building down the street.",2
Really 3.5 n nI came here with my sister and brother in law who were visiting. Brother in law had a hankering for some gyros and I passed up all the Kabob Expresses along the way looking for something a little more whole in the wally and we stumbled upon this place while looking for something else I was tired of driving . n nI had the Italian Beef with onions and hot peppers which I thought was yummy tasty. n nMinus 1 2 star because I ordered another sandwich to go for my boyfriend and they messed up my order and gave me the same exact thing that I ordered before. n nI will gladly go back again to try the gyros which my brother in law really liked.,2
"I am a Greek Mediterranean food fanatic. After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to give Yassou a try. I was pleasantly greeted by the man running the register. He seemed friendly on a personal basis with several of the customers there which is a good sign repeat customers . I decided to get Yassou gyro combo with Greek fries. I was very impressed with the gyro. It was delicious. The greek fries were good, but not impressive. The spices advertised must have left out. I got regular fries with feta cheese and a little greenery on top, but they are only fries. I'll take a good gyro over fries any day. I look forward to trying out more of their menu.",2
"Horrible food, horrible service. Loaded with sodium and very greasy! Taste awful ordered Mongolian Beef, potstickers, fried rice, chow mein, beef tenderloin and more! Ordered bottle of wine and didn't receive for 30 minutes! At the end of dinner ordered a single glass of wine to share with my boyfriend and they never brought until I asked after dessert and the waiter looked at me like I was crazy! I said may I please have my wine we ordered he just stood there staring at me. What the heck is wrong with this place. I was so excited to eat here true disbelief!",1
"I'd like to think that it was just me. I sat in a long line for an extra long time. I wasn't feeling well so I needed a hot Calm Chamomile tea to help me feel human. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, I finally reached the order window only to be told that they were out of the Calm. Not their fault. So I asked what other teas because I only order the Calm, and haven't the foggiest what else they offer they have. The girl couldn't hear me. She had an attitude. ""Which do you want? "" Oh no. If you don't have anything nice to say. So I proceeded to move forward because this required a face to face transaction. I finally reached the window and explained that I wasn't feeling well, so yelling into their intercom wasn't an option. I, again, asked what was comparable to the Calm. She recommended the Awake tea. hmmmm Calm vs Awake seem like semi polar opposites, but ok. And of course, there was a ""thing "" with my 5 agave request there always is. The Awake tea? No where near similar to the Calm. Into the trash it went. Won't be back to this location.",1
Great atmosphere and good food.that's affordable! Don't forget to check out the rooftop area!,2
"I'm trying to give it a 1 and a half but that do sent work so i gave it a 2. I found poo on the toilet seat a bloody piece of dental floss and a used coffee cup. Good thing I brought my sleeping bag because i had to sleep on the floor because my sheets where discosting. Some of the kids from my hockey team went to another hotel. It Felt like I was in a cave in the woods it was so dark. Only thing good was the lobby with the presentation room, escalator's view, ice cream, and great breakfast buffet and restaurant, I was going to say the salt water pool was good but it turned my sisters hair GREEN!",1
"So awesome! I wish I could have spent more time walking around, at least just window shopping. Can't wait to get back!",2
"It's basically a hole in the wall that has live music. The only problem with this joint is that you can't count on the bands or the guy at the joint that books them. Without the band you're just stuck in a joint paying too much fit your food. The regular customers are a good group of people and the staff has been there forever, so yeah, this could be your 'Cheers', but don't expect free refills or decent prices. Everybody will know your name, though.",1

"This place is terrible. The service is terrible. We got sat outside, ignored for 15 minutes where I had to go up to the host and ask if we had a server. Then this stupid server comes up and sits down water. Continued to ignore us. The manager came over and said he would take care of us. We ordered 2 drinks, and an appetizer. Everything seemed to be going good, until we went to order our entree. He said the kitchen was closed, but failed to tell us that when we ordered before. Said he would take care of the drinks, and then refused to.this place is terrible. They have horrible service. Do not come here, unless you like being treated like crap and less then human. Do NOT come here! Go to the one on the strip inside Paris casino.",1
"Let me start this by saying that I don't even eat sushi. I went in for a coworkers going away lunch and man am I glad I did. I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was AMAZING! n nPerfect lunch portion size of chicken and veggies in this delicious kung pao sauce. You can get either brown or white rice and it comes with miso or hot and sour soup and a good size portion of salad two orange slices. n nThe service is usually pretty good and the staff is very friendly. The price is what blows me away. for 8.30 I get a fresh, delicious, fast meal and a cold Iced Tea. I go in at least once a week and sometimes more. lol n nSo let me get this straight.for the same price as Panda Express.I can get quality fresh food that tastes a million times better? Done! n nGet in my belly!",2
My fianc u00e9 and I love George and dragon! We live down the street and ride our bikes there a lot. The owner is very friendly and the bartender is excellent! Try the honey siracha wings they are to die for.,2
This is also another cool little gaming bar. I like this place because of the no smoking and when the weather is nice they can open the doors completely so you can enjoy the nice temps.,2
"Here's looking at you, Sal. n nDon't let the unassuming suburban strip mall storefront in Sun Prairie deter you, chef Patrick DePula artisan's approach takes the humble pizza pie to a whole new level. n nI was introduced to Salvatore's at a recent Yelp Big Bite event and we really hit it off. Sal swept me off my feet with the rich tomato sauce, the gourmet quality, locally sourced toppings and that oh so chewy crust. So I decided it was time to take our relationship to the next level. Yes, it was time to introduce Sal to the rest of the family. They are not an easy bunch to please with everyone liking different pizza toppings, so this fateful meeting would determine our destiny together. n nSal started things out on the right foot. Our server welcomed us once we were seated and walked us through the menu. She was knowledgeable about the wine list and helped my wife and I with our selections. The girls ordered bottles of Hubert's lemonade surprisingly balanced, not too tart, not too sweet and my son ordered his fave, Sprecher's cream soda. n nFor the appetizer, we selected the Wisconsin meat and cheese board. The family wasn't a fan of the goat salami that meant more for me yay , but the rest of the tray was a hit. The Saucisson Sec from Underground Meats paired up perfectly with both the Hook's 5 year old cheddar and the Satori Espresso BellaVitano. n nSo Sal made it through the preliminaries, but what about the main event? Will the family embrace my new flame with the same passion? n nWe ordered two 16 "" pies with 3 different combinations. The favorite was the Terrence's Favorite fresh Italian sausage, caramelized shallots, house roasted sweet red peppers and goat cheese . We enjoyed the contrast between the sweetness of the shallots and the pungency of the goat cheese. It is a combination that we will order again. n nThe pepperoni and feta pie also was enjoyed. The slightly sweet feta was dolloped on the pie paired well with the sauce and contrasted nicely with the salty pepperoni. n nThe one combination that didn't work as well was the roasted red pepper and feta combo. The sauce just overwhelmed the other toppings. While it's a great sauce a wonderful balance of savory, sweetness and acidity with a definite herbal backbone , I would have the kitchen hold back a little on the sauce to make for a more balanced bite between toppings, sauce and crust. This, along with the noisiness of the dining room, tilted the rating to four stars. n nThe real star of the night was the crust. It was the Helen of Troy of crusts its golden hue could launch a thousand ships. The crust has both bite and chew, a hint of natural sweetness and SERIOUS flavor. Unlike many large pizzas that are doughy in the middle and too crunchy along the outer edge, this pizza was perfectly baked. The ultimate test, not one of the kids left any crust behind like is usually the case with lesser pizzas. n nAfter polishing off a couple of refreshing cappuccino gelatos for dessert, our server packed up the leftovers, and called it a night. As for me and Sal, well, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.",2
"I wanted to love this place so much. It's around the corner from my place and was super excited to hear of its opening. Went in today right at 5. It was hard to miss all of the employees in the restaurant, and equally hard to miss how messy the salsa bar and drink station were. Surely one of the employees could wipe the counters? The best thing I ordered was a side of beans. Beans. My turkey mole taco was ok. But the pastor taco had no flavor. Both tacos needed salt. I'm so sad that the food wasn't better. Not sure if I will try again.",1
"I highly recommend the show. Although I did not know 2 3 of the songs, I enjoyed the experience fully. The arena is round, so the stage is 360 therefore, there is no bad seat in the house! My mind was overwhelmed by trying to track all the dancers and acrobats coming from all parts of the stage and above too! . It can be little loud, especially at the beginning of the show, so wear ear plugs if you must. n nIt's the bomb!",2
"Best Buffet in Vegas. in my opinion. hehe. I have been to a few buffets in Vegas and this is definitely the one I have enjoyed the most. They have a huge assortment of dishes. My favorites include the tuna poke, peeled shrimps, prime rib, and the pesto mashed potatoes I dream of those ! The only complaints I have are that I wish the dining areas were nicer and the dessert bar was more creative. Overall it's a great dining choice while in Vegas. Enjoy!",2
"After eating there at least monthly for the last year, Tokyo Lobby is a distant memory. We have a new item every time we order and we've still barely made a dent in the impressive menu! n nThe place isn't fancy, but who cares? It is clear that it's a family business who has no aspirations to becoming a nationwide chain. And that's fine by me. n nThe waitress is very friendly greeting me by name when I walk through the door, remembering my orders even when I forgot to get my usual garlic tuna roll , and giving me small treats as I wait for my takeout. The owners are similarly pleasant, so i imagine that it's part of their customer service culture. n nI recommend Ari Sushi to everyone I know that lives near the area and they all have loved it as well. The place has gotten busier, which results in longer wait times at the peak. But it's the price you have to pay to make sure that it stays in business.",2
"The fascination with Nakama has always left me confused. I'm not a huge hibachi fan, so my gripes truly rest with the sushi. As far as sushi goes, Nakama simply doesn't deserve the praise that it gets. Granted, when they first opened, the food was decent, but even back then it was never a truly great sushi place. n nNow, if you like your sushi over saturated in sauces, then you might enjoy it, but all too often, the rolls are soggy, poorly rolled, and the fish quality isn't as good as you'd expect if you were judging the restaurant from the outside. Blame it on the pace with which the chefs have to prepare it.blame it on them hiring inexperienced sushi chefs. Whatever it is, it's just not up to par with some of the other sushi places in Pittsburgh. In fact, the sushi at the Tokyo Buffet on McKnight is just as good.AND THAT'S A BUFFET! n nRegardless, it's always packed, and I'm a huge fan of seeing businesses succeed in town, but Nakama is truly a place that's gained too much from its trendy status. Unfortunately, I'm all about the food, so after you enjoy a good martini and enjoy the little hibachi show, what you're left with is the reality that the food is second priority to those other two parts. n nThe hibachi is fine, but it's nothing special.of course, when is hibachi ever truly a special experience, taste wise? It's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth. The best hibachi I've ever had at Nakama was the ahi tuna.the cut of fish was actually fresher than sashimi that I've ordered there, and keeping it seared, but rare in the middle kept it from drying out. Or maybe that was just the butter.either way, it's by far the one thing that I've walked away with good feelings about. n nThe sashimi cuts that I've had have rarely satisfied. Fresh fish shouldn't taste so fishy, and for what you pay, they should be serving up better cuts. The sushi menu is interesting enough that you'll be able to find what you're looking for, but it's truly a hit or miss experience when the sushi hits your taste buds. n nOverall, Nakama is the hot spot where you meet your friends before hitting the clubs and make random friends over some happy hour drinks, but if you're looking for a quality meal, I'd enjoy the drinks and move on to any number of better restaurants nearby.",1

"I really wanted to enjoy this place. n nThe good The decor is fun. And the servers are so kind, and even attentive, despite the conditions in which they're forced to work. Really. They're superb. The 2 stars up there are entirely for them. To the owners Help them help you. n nAnd i'm afraid that's it for the positives. n nThe bad nGenerally speaking it feels like no one is in charge or that this is the first time the owners have run a restaurant. n nWhen you first arrive you are left to find your own seat. That works in some places, but Pallets needs a host stand and a host ess . This will give a level of defense between the uncontrolled steady stream of customers and the overworked wait staff. It also communicates an element of control over the situation to the customers. When you tell me to sit anywhere I want, you might think it gives me some independence in my decision, but it's just forcing me to work against your broken system to find the least inconvenient seat. n nWhich brings me to my next suggestion more wait staff and clearly defined sections. Each time I've been there the staff seems like they're managing the entire restaurant. And while I appreciate a team approach much like Windsor I never got the feeling that any one server was owning my table's experience. n nThe kitchen. Each time I've eaten at Pallets I've dined with a companion and each time one dish comes up significantly earlier than the other. And each time the runner had no idea who ordered what. There is clearly a timing issue in the kitchen. n nThe food. It's okay. I don't have anything negative to say about it but I also don't have anything really superb to say about it. I wasn't blown away. But that's okay. It' doesn't have to be amazing if the rest of the experience made up for it. But it doesn't. You can't have a disorderly restaurant and just okay food. If the food was amazing it would be worth the inconvenience. See The NY soup nazi, or the long wait's at Matt's Big Breakfast. n nSo there's my constructive criticism. I'll try again in a few months and hope they've improved. n nHowever I do have one ranting complaint. the single element that absolutely drives me crazy about this place. and I can confidently say I won't be coming back until it's gone. the DJ. Why is it that every time I just want to go have a nice piece of sushi I have to feel like I'm in a night club? I could barely hear my friend speaking to me. And why would I want to relax in a hammock with a DJ blaring into my ear five feet away? I don't get it and I don't like it. Save the restaurant some money and just play some music over the house PA.",1
love this barber shop! I just wish they served beer whilst I gets my hair did!,2
"I was not impressed! I went here because of the reviews, but found that the service was poor, the food mediocre, and not hot enough for me. I am always checking mexican restaurants for the food and the heat. I love the food, being from NM and also love the heat.this one fails.would not go back!",1
"Stripclub with expensive drinks, rude bouncers, unfriendly hostesses and bartenders. The hostess didn't allow one of us to use a pen, and that is after the 30 cover and 100 of lap dances and drinks per each of us.",1
"First of all, this review is specifically in relation to Asian buffets. You can't compare apples to oranges, so don't bother comparing this place to a fine steakhouse. With that said, this is about as good as it gets in Charlotte for Asian buffets. You won't find a larger and more authentic selection of Asian food anywhere in the QC. From dim sum to pho, chow fun to lo mein, steamed crawfish and white fish, pot stickers, sushi, and the obligatory yet surprisingly good chicken wings just for good measure. If the sight of chicken feet grosses you out, just stick with your local Panda Express. But if you've come to venture beyond the Americanized version, this place will suit your needs. There's a reason the place is always packed, and noticeably with lots of Asian people. If you don't like crab legs, save yourself some cash and come for lunch. Dinner is significantly more expensive and the only differences are the crab legs and the Beijing duck.",2
"Let me preface this by saying, it's the Verizon Store and I knew what to expect. n nI am still waiting for one Verizon Store to come along and surprise me one day. By actually giving me prompt service, not having 12 employees in the store and only 5 of them working, not trying to up sell you on products you don't need, and for god sakes just give you what you need in a timely manner. Not too much to ask for. n nThis one was just like all the others was 4th in line on their check in, but still had to wait 23 minutes to even be talked too. In that time I saw employees standing there. The iPhone 5 products were all out of stock, not their fault but just added to the bad experience. n nDriving out of the parking lot I drove by an AT T, maybe it's time I made the switch.",1
"The Fremont Street Experience has turned into a dump of nothing more then street beggars, drunks, homeless and thieves.

The MGM is okay. But I would group this hotel casino in with all the old school Vegas opulence. I add the Venetian into this category too. For me it's all about ARIA and modernity now. I think my biggest problem with the MGM is how freakin' big it is. Get your bearings while you are not wearing heels folks or ladies. The separate elevators for the rooms and parking garage through me for one. I think the layout for self parking is really confusing. I also slipped 2x in the parking garage. I'm a little clumsy normally but I noticed that both times I slipped it was on the white paint throughout the parking spaces. n nI stayed on the 11th floor gorgeous view of the neon lights and the bed was ridiculously good. I can't remember the last time I slept so good. Oh and if you get hungry really late the only thing open is Wolfgang Pucks. Breakfast options are kind of limited to either Starbucks or Witchcraft where they have breakfast sandwiches from 9 14 each.,1
"I must have eaten here a dozen times in the past month or so, and every time I leave stuffed and satisfied. Service and food are consistent. I've come across some new favorites on the menu in addition to the Thai curries and the 7 Star Around the Moon namely the chicken beef and eggplant in garlic sauce has some nice heat to it that works great on cold days like today. n nStill haven't tackled the sushi, but this place is consistently a winner. My only fear is the place always seems to be empty. Makes for a nice atmosphere but I want this place to do well so it sticks around get out there and try it people!",2
"Last night was my second time here. The service was bad. Started off good, but things progressively got worse. Our food took forever to come out but we saw it sitting on the line. I would have asked where the food was but we could not find our server. Eventually a different server came over and said that someone made a mistake with one of the sandwiches and that's why the food took so long. Why everyone at our table had to wait over one sandwich, I don't know . Once the food came out it was pretty bad. The buns on the sliders were hard, the fries were cold and soggy, my pizza was missing ingredients. I got the Hunters which called for arugula and balsamic which it had neither. Prob won't be coming back any time soon if at all. Just overall weird bad service this time around.",1
"I really enjoyed eating here. The food has been good and the 3 dollar pints on Fridays is nice as well. The place is neat and tidy and the staff is very friendly. They messed up on my dessert but comped it to me for the screw up. Overall a good experience, and the appeteizers were great. I would reccomend this place.",2
"Wow, fantastic food and amazing service. I cannot wait till I go back. The pizza is great, the salads amazing and the sandwiches over the moon. Best place for a outside lunch when the weather is cooler here in Phoenix. But the Ac works inside. Be sure to try them out.",2
"Good service,not great. Lousy food. This is not Italian food,I don't know what it is but it's not Italian. Growing up in Italian Catholic Brooklyn New York I think I'm familiar with Italian food. nMy wife had linguini clams. How do you screw up a simple dish like linguini clams? They did. First of all,thin spaghetti is not linguini. And adding carmelized onions? Really? Had a really funky taste that was not good the onions actually made it slimy should not have been on the plate made for a horrible combination. nNow,my chicken Marsala. The cook needs to put a cork in that bottle of Marsala,it was so overloaded that I couldn't taste anything else. nIt's really a shame because they have a lot of employees who should start looking for work elsewhere because this place will go the way of Don Antonio's with the slop they're serving. Remember Don Antonio's? Didn't think so.",1
"The steak was absolutely fabulous! The restaurant is great for a fancy romantic date. We went there as a luxury because we were there for our honeymoon. The steaks are marinated for 90 days! Exceptional. The prices are pretty steep we ended paying 300 for 2 people but this is a one in a lifetime experience. The steak is hugeee, the mushroom pasta was tiny, but to die for. And the service is outstanding.",2
Be careful if you are vegetarian and order from here. The last two times they didn't follow my order and I got a chicken burrito instead of a veggie one. nVery disappointing. If you order the normal stuff and are flexible about what they actually give you then the staff is pretty nice and it's not that bad. It was a guilty thing for me anyway so I'm going to go elsewhere.,1
"Really great food, best Indian meal I've had in Edinburgh. Staff are very friendly. Outside and inside was refurbished recently and looks the better for it photos on yelp are dated now The food is tasty, great variety sabzi chiili dahl is amazing, the chicken dish in the chef's special wow!",2
"We just returned from LDW 2011. n nI don't hand out one stars easily and I certainly don't like doing it unless a place has some serious work to do. n nOur server was really nice, but a bit flakey. On more than one occasion she wandered over to our table with the either another tables items or the wrong thing for us. She may have just been having an off night. This is not about the service or the cute decor. This is about the food. n nI have travelled around the world and eaten in some pretty sketchy places. I have only experience food poisoning a few times in my life. n nOne was in a horrible hotel in Barranquilla, Colombia. I was sick for 3 weeks and lost 12lbs. Several people in our group had to be hospitalized. Luckily I wasn't one of them. n nTwo other times were at home and the final bout with food poisoning came at the hands of nasty shrimp during my recent experience at the Lobby Bar Cafe. n nThis is absolutely inexcusable at a fine resort such as Encore. Especially in this day and age and when you are paying through the nose to stay somewhere. I realize s t happens any time any where, but that doesn't make it acceptable! n nWe hadn't seen our friends all day, as we chilled at the Euro pool on Sunday, while they went to see Kaskade spin. We met up for a quick pre dinner drink before getting ready for my birthday dinner at Mastro's. n nEveryone sat down and ordered drinks. I was the only one eating and I ordered the potato with bacon, ham and cheese panini, and the spicy shrimp. We didn't stay long maybe 45 mins or an hour total. I only had one drink that was still half full when we left to get ready for dinner. n nAs soon as I stood up the vertigo and dizziness started. I thought goodness I haven't even finished my drink how can I already feel drunk. The walls felt like they were closing in on me as we stepped into the elevator. n nI barely made it up to the room and I needed to lay down. I knew something wasn't right. I felt hot and like a migraine was coming on. All I wanted to do was close my eyes and have the weird feeling coming over me go away. n nIt wasn't 20 mins later that I flew out of the bed like a bat outta hell and had to bow down before the porcelain throne. After tossing cookies several times, I crawled back to bed and curled into fetal position. That is where I remained the rest of the evening. I couldn't move because the dizziness, headache, and lethargy were so intense. I told my husband there was no way I could rally and that dinner needed to be cancelled. Talk about disappointing! n nMy birthday dinner was completely ruined and an entire evening of our Vegas Vaca was lost into the Abyss that was food poisoning. This may not seem like much to you and yes, luckily I did recover the next day enough to enjoy the rest of our stay, but when you are only in town for the weekend one night lost is too many. n nI will say that after my friends complained to the management they did send up a security official to check on me. I declined medical attention mostly because I didn't want to move from my bed. I didn't even get up when he came in the room. I know this is all part of the Encore's risk management, but I still appreciated the effort despite the occasion. It's the level of service you would expect at 5 star hotel. n nAnyway all I can say is I hope you never ever have to experience what I went through here. Now I have been put off eating one of my favorite items and I certainly will NEVER EVER eat at this restaurant again!",1
"I love this bakery I bought my daughter's birthday cake here several years back and now that she is turning 21 she wants the same cake, They are so nice here and was made the cake exactly how I wanted.

Even though they control the air and heat, it is based on weather trends and not a fixed date. n nThe staff is nice enough, I've never had to deal with them for any issues I pick up packages and ask random questions when needed and they are professional and helpful. The maintenance guys are really nice and always checking up on me if they see me walking around the property. My A C went out once in the summer and they were there in an hour or so. Fixed it up quick. And they're really nice when I call about my garbage disposal even though they've shown me where the switch is a few times haha. n nRent is reasonable, staff is nice and helpful, grounds are decent. They even put in a cute little dog park recently! I'd recommend living here to any friend or family member.",2
"Like Whoa, n nRobert puts most servers in this town to shame. Like the awesome action figure's from the 90's that could do it all, thats Robert. He whips up mean drinks that will knock you on the floor if you have too many. He gets your orders put in the system quickly and makes sure the food is just right. He even recommends a certain way for the food to be cooked, which makes it taste better more juicy. Robert really is part of the Twin Creek experience. Ask for the TC Manhattan drink. n nMichelle, Like a mini Robert. Tries hard and gets 80 of everything down pat. Great smile and great attitude. n nAwesome food. Goodness Gracious, great meat balls of Fire! This stuff is legendary and with legendary prices. Might I recommend the back wrapped shrimp or Meatballs. n nTo reiterate Awesome drinks, seriously.",2
I had an excellent margherita pizza here. n nI knew this place was a hit and busy all the time but luckily I happened to be in the area when it was slow and checked it out for the first time. The seating is a little uncomfortable but the pizza was great and so were the servers. n nI thought I saw on the Yelp app that they don't do take outs but I saw people leaving with pies so I'm going to give it a try.,2
"The accomodations at this Holiday Inn compared to the Express down the street are not even close. The rooms are outdated, I had cob webs on my ceiling, you could hear every sound and everyone walking by your room outside your door. The wireless had a weak signal in my room even tho my room was located in the center of the building near the pool. Didn't stay long enough to enjoy the rest of the hotel, good thing I booked with the hotel itself, they were able to cancel my reservation for the rest of the week and stayed one night. That is why there is two stars instead of one due to the friendly and accomodating customer service at the front desk.",1
Was not impressed my last visit. Sushi quality has gone downhill or something. What is normally cold sushi was literally at room temperature. The hot items were literally at room temperature as well. My stomach did not feel too well for 2 days after my visit here.,1
"Another on my list of ""how have I not reviewed this yet? "" n nIt's easy to pass this place, or to confuse it for the Best Wok next door. New Zealand Cafe is a tiny parcel in a crowded strip mall that is serving incredible Kiwi inspired Japanese dishes at amazing prices. The bento box is by far the best deal. It's all from the grill instead of the customary sushi , but you get an unbelievable amount of tasty food for about 10. n nSpeaking of sushi, they work wonders. They have a sushi bar, where you can dine in front of the chefs and watch them work their grace and elegance is worth the visit. n nDo be advised that take out is usually be best option. It's very small and quite ""cozy "" inside if you have one of the low, square tables in the middle, odds are good you'll get to know your neighbors. n nDon't let that deter you though great Asian fusion at the Galleria!",2

"I was craving a chocolate milkshake, a few days ago so this was the nearest mcdonalds that was in my travel route. I decided to go thru drive thru and full fill my cravings. I also got nuggets and fries.now here is the worst. My fries were OLD not even recooked old they were old as in they sat there for more than an hour they tasted like yesterdays fries . Chewy, bland, rough , cold and disgusting. My nuggets were old and my milkshake gave me, the worst stomach ache. May I add the cashier or mgr shirt was filthy at the bottom . Like she was washing dishes and cleaning the grill or broiler, whatever it is they have. Then she was handling the food .yuck! Clean your clothes ! I felt like it was run by homeless people and the manager in charge of this restaraunt is not following mcdonalds standards .Ive had better.",1
went here for lunch with Rand H. and the service here was terrible.I found the food to be OK so i was going to give them 3 stars but service is so bad a ok goes down to meh.

"If only there was another location on the east side. nThere are a lot of custard shops in my area but I don't think twice about driving all the way to the west side for some of this yogurt. nThey have many different flavors and have always let me sample ones before I make my decision. nThey have alot of topping to choose from and you can also have the same kinds of dishes that you are used to with custard.

They also have smoothies and other things advertised that I haven't had the chance to try, but have no doubts that they are good. nThey have something for everyone and its basically guilt free!",2

"I do love this store for its community spirit. I've been to a couple of social events where two leggeds were allowed to attend with their furry owners and everyone was very well behaved. At the ice cream social they even had treats for the humans so they wouldn't keep begging for the tail wagging sweet potato ice cream,begging in public can be so annoying! n nThe owners also do a lot of animal rescue support, including offering cat food from bags inadvertently ripped during shipping to neighbors caring for feral communities. n nJust a great all around store where everyone of every species feels immediately welcome.",2
"Not a bad pub, but tends to attract a strange clientele mix. n nConveniently located out the front of Haymarket train station it has it's fair share of travellers and backpackers biding their time before their train comes along as well as those long time locals who come hail, rain or shine to prop up the bar ensuring it doesn't fall over. n nAll the usual tipple available and the staff are friendly ish. Not massive in size so be prepared to share a table with said locals or Hans and Helga from Dusseldorf.",1
"Indoor track, Juice bar, personal trainers, swimming pool, and just about anything else you need to exercise. What I really enjoy about this gym is the design and layout of it. It just looks better and more up to date than the other gyms I've been to. I really can't think of anything negative to say about LVAC other than it does tend to get packed after 5pm due to the after work rush but you can't expect this place to be empty all the time.",2

"This McDonald's is consistent, in that it will ruin your morning every time. They have a double drive thru that there was apparently zero training for. This morning I pulled up to the speaker and before anyone said anything to me the other Lane took 3 orders. Then they charged me for the wrong order. Then they mistook my request for 'No Onions please' has 'Only onions please', Even though by the time i got it I had repeated my order several times. Then wanted me to pull over and wait while they figure it out. . And trust me this is a typical breakfast run here.",1

After a long day of shopping I decided to stop at the Cracker Barrel, Hadn't been to Cracker Barrel in a long time but every time I drive past it's always packed so I thought the Cracker Barrel would be good food choice. WOW was I wrong! n nThe service was slow, and the food was tasteless and cold. It was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Even though we ate very little off our plates it wasn't until the cashier asked me ""how was the food "" that anyone even showed concern. I told the cashier it was ""terrible it just wasn't good "". I wasn't going to speak to a manager initially however the two cashiers talked me into speaking with a manger. After waiting 20 minutes for a manager, I walked away with one thought on my mind.

"We went for lunch a Saturday at 1 30 PM. nThe first disappointment was that they do not offer a full lunch menu on weekends, just a limited brunch menu. n nThe next disappointment was bad service, from slow sitting to not offering us bread during the very long wait for our brunch. n nAs for the food, the Monrealese sandwich was quite good but the amount of spicy Dijon made me cry.",1
"I just moved to this area, and wanted to find a great waxing salon. n nWhen first went to this establishment it was spotless and they got me in right away for a Brazilian. When I showed up the place was impeccably clean, and I was extremely impressed. If only my experience was to end there. n nThe front desk then informed me that they had a scheduling error and I would have to wait 45 minutes or reschedule. I decided to wait, as I was getting ready to vacation to San Diego and wanted to be hairless for my beach vacation. While I waited there the front desk was unprofessional, talking about what staff was horrible and every bit of gossip this staff had to offer each other. n nOnce I went into the back room, the waxer was incredibly rude. She had no desire to turn my experience around. When I got home I had patches that were missed, and in the weeks that my hair was growing out I had horrible problems with ingrown hairs. I have been waxing for a year now, and never had a problem with ingrown hair. I am assuming this is way they try to sell you the serum against ingrown hairs because they know their ""special "" formula will cause you to have ingrown hairs. n nthen to top it off the ladies at the front desk were extremely pushing on me pre purchasing my next wax. I will never go back to this place ever again. Especially for the price that they charge to have a wax.",1
"Coming from Sacramento The shows I have been to were either in Arco Arena where the acoustics are Terrible and the others at the memorial auditorium which has better acoustics but is a nightmare to get out of when a show ends, this place was a breath of fresh air for the most part. n nI had GA floor tickets and ended up about 2 to 3 feet from the stage for the show and was very very impressed with the acoustics in this place and the venue in general has the small feel and helps to make the show that much better. I have never been to a venue that allows cameras and video cameras to be used during the show and that is the one star deficit you see here. Not because I am trying to be like Lars from Metallic and crap all over everyones choice to share the music but I tend to get aggravated when a 300lb sweaty dude next to me has his stink pit right in my face while trying to record the ""ENTIRE SHOW "". n nOther than the distraction of cameras in your face and Miss teenage dreamer screaming in your ear with hopes of getting on the tour bus this place is awesome. I would not hesitate to see a show here.",2
"We barely didn't make it here as it was New Year's week and all of the restaurants on the Strip seemed to have been booked like there was no tomorrow! Lucky for us, the wonderful MGM concierge were able to book us a albeit very late! reservation. n nWhen I first walked in, I couldn't decide whether or not I hated or loved the decor. Yes, it was ""fancy "".but I couldn't help but think that I was inside a Christmas present! Everything was sparkly and our table had these little gold balls strewn about, with a very glittery sparkly table runner and these glittery twigs of some sort as the centerpiece. I was a bit distracted at best until our waiter came and his French accent made me forget about the decor at least for a moment or so. n nI loved that the menu given to me didn't have prices, but the one given to my husband did! I also love the bread cart that they bring out before dinner. The milk bread was deelish, but I can do without the bacon twist ? As far as dinner went we had the 6 course tasting menu and every little dish served to us was fantastic! My fave? The chorizo soup.omg, that was to die for! But everything was so good, it was fairly difficult to pick just one! n nI would love to come here again, but it's definitely a once in a lifetime deal.unless, of course, you've got some major cash to spare!",2

"Mediocre pretty sure it's a drug front because they've never had any other business when I've been by.

The Snow Crab was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and tender I was very sad to see I ate it all it was that good! n nI also added an order of hush puppies, that was some fried up goodness right there and tried out there bbq beans, those were not the most pretties to look at but it made up in flavor for sure, before I knew it. it was gone. n nThe Angry Crab was a great dinner choice, look forward to going back!",2
"I have been a faithful aria resort er since the first week they opened and refused to stay anywhere else. This last stay, was completely unbelievable. I had a 900 necklace stolen out of our room by housekeeping, and my friend had her couple hundred tiffanys necklace taken as well. I know for a fact it was stolen because the clutch it was in was missing, and the necklace had a small tangle I didn't feel like dealing with right then, so neither ever left the room. I called the hotel. They couldn't have seemed to care less if they tried. On top of it, all of the electronics in the room are out of date. Touch screens were great a few years ago, but now are shot. The curtain that was supposed to open when you first walk in didn't. Lots of little things. But my grandmothers necklace was the last straw for me.

"As if the atmosphere in the Hotel Valley Ho wasn't already fantastic, this little area near the hotel' lounge and bar area is understated and upscale at the same time.

I liked my drink but the rim needed salt and perhaps a little less tequila it was a very HAPPY hour . We each ordered a side. I got the prime rib dip and she orded the pretzels with chips and cheese. Each of us were in food heaven. The prime rib dip came with an au jau sauce and had the most melt in your mouth cheese on top. The meet was fall off the bone good and the bread was perfect.

"Best Stromboli I've had outside of NY or Chi town.

"I have been to RA a couple of times at different locations. My main thought is that it is WAAAAAAAY overpriced. 10 for a well martini? REALLY? One trip, I got 2 drinks, peppers, and one or two sushi rolls which are relatively small , and I paid 60! Yes.60 bucks for ONE person to not even get full! I then heard from a friend that happy hour is the best time to go.prices on happy hour items are a bit more reasonable. So.I went to the late night 10 close happy hour last weekend. n nWe walked up and saw a few tables of people outside, and inside there were no more than a handful more.good, not too busy. There was one other woman waiting at the host stand so we stood behind her. We stood there.and stood there.and stood there. n nSeveral times employees walked by one even gave a polite little head nod which verified that none of us were invisible. However, even after several times of poking our heads around the dining area and toward the bar tender, no host ever came. We even walked around the fish tank at the entrance thinking maybe someone would come over out of concern that we were essentially BEHIND the host table. Nope! n nAfter at least 10 minutes of being completely ignored we finally gave up and left. That other woman stayed. That was about a week ago. She very well may still be waiting there. We went to a different restaurant where we paid much less than we would have at RA even at happy hour prices and where we were served very quickly. n nI have had it with RA. Food is expensive and the taste quality is mediocre.more presentation than substance. They use tricks to make the food appear larger than it is.spreading out the pieces of sushi roll, garnishing with sauces and some items to make the dish appear taller. It looks nice of course, but when you're hungry, the aesthetics don't fill you up! Happy hour was my last attempt at allowing them to win me as a customer.and I never made it past the entrance.",1

"So.I'm not usually one to frequent corporate restaurants.but I can't stay away from those dang frozen margaritas! If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't eat here half as much.

Can't go wrong there.and the Tejas trio is great to snack on if you just want a small bite.",2
"I expect long lines and a wait. It is the post office right? It is the rudeness and obvious unhappy staff that is just unacceptable. n nThe way the postal workers speak to individuals is really appalling.

"Great massage yesterday from Andrea. It was my third massage with her was having difficulty with temperature mine, not the room and she graciously offered to ""turn on the bed.

I didn't want to be demanding but Andrea was very accommodating and she even remembered to cover me up quickly so I did not get chilled. I have highly recommended Andrea to others and they are equally pleased.",2
This place is overhyped. n nThe service is awful. Order a dill pickle get a sour. Order turkey and get smoked meat. Basically you are given whatever the server is in the mood to give you. n nAnd the smoked meat is rather bland. Perhaps I am spoiled coming from NY and being surrounded by some of the best delis in the world but my personal opinion is that the meat at Schwartz is mediocre at best. Not worth the wait or hassle.,1
This is excellent Chinese food. I had the chicken low mein the egg rolls. You won't find better. Especially in this area. The customer service was also great. This is where I'll bring my out of town guest.,2
"This place sounds cooler than it is. The employees literally do not acknowledge you at all! Everything is divided into stations toddlers, travel, high school. which is kind of cool but sometimes the paper that's in a certain station that doesn't apply there at all. The worst part is that none of the paper has price tags! You have to ring it up before you know the price which is probably too expensive. So it would be cool if you were looking for something really original that you just couldn't find anywhere else like specific state or country embellishments but other than that I would definitely just go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels.",1
"This show is the best on the strip. It has everything from comedy to burlesque. Aerial acts. From the moment you walk in the entertainment is non stop. Strong language so be forewarned.

"Been working downtown for 5 years and went to this place for the first time today. My wife had the gyro feta salad and I the gyroa feta pita sub. Both were good, really nice gyro meat. The only thing I didn't like about my gyro was that the tomatoes and onions weren't cut up enough, and kept falling out of the pita, but otherwise the taste was right on for a gyro. n nIts a good lunch joint, but kind of hard to get to because its right next to the light rail. The price is good too. Will definitely go back as it looks like they have a good selection of greek and Chicago style items.",2

"Seriously Carolina's? This place is not at all what I expected it to be. It's busy. There was a line bigger than the restaurant. But super disappointing once my food arrived. 45 minutes later. I got a machaca burrito apparently that's what the rave was about and was completely dissatisfied. My husband had the shredded beef tacos and a green tamale dry with sweet masa, BLEH . Nothing to write home about. I've been searching far and wide for an authentic Mexican food place and these Arizona places are nothing compared to the real food back home in the streets of LA! You people have no idea what good food is. Sorry.",1
"I bought a groupon deal and had dinner here on a Sunday night. Came here around 7ish holy Hera the wait was about 45 min long! When we finally got seated, our server took forever to get our drinks and we had to wait for utensils. Food here is definitely overrated and I honestly did not think I got my money's worth even though I got a ""deal "" on it. The only good things were prime rib and the crepes. Macaroons were over done and tasted like they were 1 days old. Everything else was meh dessert was almost like out of a hometown buffet. I will not be coming back here.",1
"I dined Halloween night. Lots of empty tables so we expected service to be prompt and accurate. I guess the trick was on us. The booth we were given was broken and sloped toward the booth exit. I could not even stay on the bench. We switched sides of the table which was okay but the table also sloped away so our water glasses and all plates with liquids showed n the severity of the slope. nOne of the appetizers, stuffed peppers, was ice cold right from the fridge. We asked if it was supposed to be warm and they said it was. So they brought us a new one or while later. nThe ""chicken under a brick "" tasted pretty good, but there was no mention of the enormous quantity of skin left on the chicken. Perhaps I was supposed to have guessed, but the menu said nothing of it. The fatty skin and Chrisley bits detract greatly from the otherwise enjoyable chicken And the broccoli tasted very much of gas grill propane fuel. nFor dessert we wanted the lemon cake, but they said they no longer offer it with marscapone. They even said they didn't have any that night, yet they have tiramisu that uses it. So we asked for the cake to not be chilled, rather have it heated for 10 or 15 seconds to give it a bit of work. Just like stuffed peppers it was ice cold right from the fridge. Disappointing but not surprising by this point. Also not once did they offer to refill our water glasses. So overall it was a pretty spooky experience full of tricks on us. ",1
"I'm a sucker for places that re use modernist architecture I remember from my youth see The Vig, etc . This place used to be the delightfully tacky yet unrefined Salon De Venus beauty parlor. Now it's a different sort of parlor. A pizza parlor. Get it? Good. Check out the naked lady wallpaper in the bathrooms. n nI hear it's owned by the same people who brought us Nello's. Not a bad association at all. n nI am probably biased by the fact that it's within stumbling distance from me, but this is one of my favorite happy hour and lunch spots in Phoenix. Everything I've tried on the menu has been impressive. Of course, because I myself am tacky yet unrefined my choices only have gone as far as pizzas, but pizza in itself can obviously pose a great challenge. n nGo and enjoy.",2
"ATMOSPHERE I couldn't imagine it being any better. Located in Vieux Montreal old Montreal just off the river, this establishment was featuring live jazz when we visited, and smooth jazz over the stereo when the band took breaks. The area feels very much European, much like a lot of Montreal, naturally. n nSERVICE our server was a nice young man from Vancouver that gave us all sorts of suggestions for things to do. He, and everyone else, was awesome. n nFOOD I had a nice filet mignon been eating lots of steak, lately that was very good, but I want to highlight that the lamb chops that Tarra T had were perhaps the BEST I've had in life.period. Didn't taste too gamey, very tender. They were ri donk ulous. n nCheck it out if ever in Montreal.",2

"The BAD n n the racist bouncer who made the only brown girls trying to get in stand in line with the dudes for an hour AND pay the 20 cover n the drinks too pricey even for Vegas n dance floor cramped and crowd just ok. n And one of my biggest pet peeves the dj repeated songs. I heard the same song 3X in the same nite! If that doesn't happen in the burbs where I'm from how is it possible on The Strip?! n nIf you're on the edge about this place, I'd say don't do it.

"I'm mainly writing a review for Monday Night Football here. For 20, you get 3 drink tickets, free food and a few raffle tickets. During every commercial break, they draw tickets where you can win prizes such as lap dance dollars, t shirts and a usually 1 2 bigger prizes like a bicycle or a stereo for your home. During half time they have 1 lap dances where u get a bunch of girls come around and give you short 10 seconds dances for 1. Overall, it's a great time and I've taken friends who don't really have in interest in NFL and they really enjoyed. n nI also suggest that you stop by the Las Vegas Hilton before and make a few proposition bets. They don't have to be high bets. Just make like 3 4 and everyone chips in 5 for each bet. It makes the game a lot more fun when you're rooting for sacks, INT's, etc. Especially when it's 2 teams that you don't really care about.",2
"TEN STARS! Absolutely, positively the most amazing show I have ever seen, ever. The detail and thought put into this production is mind blowing. All of the music choices were absolute perfection so many of his hits, yet also a good mix of more obscure yet still amazing songs. The performers have such strength and grace and they were mesmerising. The theatre was gorgeous, and there is literally not a bad seat in the house. We were in 202 row NN and we could see everything going on from the ceiling down to the stage. The show happens all around you so really wherever you sit, you will be pleased. Enjoy!",2

The sickly sweet smell walking in the door left my clothes reeking of the air freshener long after I left the building. n nChairs at all the slots were not height adjustable and I felt like I was sliding off them. Couldn't sit for longer than a couple minutes without a backache. n nRidiculous wait times for the buffet which is overpriced noisy. Tables are small jammed together. Not a place to come for leisurely dining. Desserts were the best part of it. n nDecor is eye pleasing, modern more expensive looking than some of the older casinos around town.",1
The wife and I love to go to this place from time to time. The decor is modern and clean and the food is great. I must admit that we have only ordered a few things off of the menu but they are so good we are scared to venture to much on the menu. The fried chicken and the lamb chops are the gems of this menu. I also had one of their infused vodka martinis the last time we went and it was great. We hear that the brunch is equally amazing. Love this place.,2
"Love it, been there several times now and will continue to return! nSticky Toffee Pudding AWESOME!",2
"Very disappointed! n nI picked this place because of the reviews that I've read here. I feel compelled to give my 2 cents worth. n nWe started out with jalapeno hushpuppies along with their remoulade. The pups were very tasty good start . n nFor our main course, we ordered the fried green tomato salad to share, my wife ordered the gumbo with a side of fried okra, and I ordered the fried catfish with double okra on the side. n nThe lag time between our pups and meal was LONG.outrageously long. When they finally brought our meal, my wife didn't get her okra. They explained that it would take a few more minutes. Keep in mind, my plate had okra so I guess they must have forgot about hers. It was no less than 10 minutes before they brought hers out. n nWhen we finally received our meal the bartender apologized for the wait and explained that everything they have is fresh breaded and not frozen which is why it takes longer. I can understand how fresh breaded takes longer but you should find a way to do it faster or take it off the menu if it's going to logjam your kitchen. n nAll this being said, even after the wait, if the food was good I would be writing a positive review right now. The problem is, the food was just so so. The okra had NO flavor and was not fully cooked to a nice crisp crust. My catfish flavor was ok but the breading was pretty thick. My wife's gumbo was a little bland.almost like the roux was a little weak. n nI really wanted to like this place. After our first experience, I won't likely go back.",1
"A series of strip mall shopping spread across four corners.

I'm missing some places, but you get the picture. One could spend lots of time here. I particularly like the Ross not ghetto, and no unattended screaming children and all the great dining choices in the area. All the asterisk marked places, I've been to, btw. I heard that Fry's is coming to the area, as well this place is always so packed . n nThere is ample parking at each of the parts that make up Boca Park Fashion Village. Lunch and Dinner seem to be peak times, for obvious reasons. The tree lined streets coupled with european design influence make this area very pretty.",2
"To sum up authentic Bavarian restaurant located off the strip with huge beer and great food. n nTo elaborate My very first trip here was for a friend's birthday extravaganza. My first thought when I walked in was BEER! and lots of it. Now being a Bavarian place they don't offer light beer so don't even think about it. They offered Hefeweizen, Dunkel and a seasonal which in this case was a dark wheat beer. If you're looking for large quantities of tasty libation this is the place to go get the litre and be amazed at the size of the stein you get. n nOn to the food if you like Bavarian read German food, this is the place to be. I happen to be a fan, so I was in heaven and quite honestly was torn for a while. Oh the food was sooooooo good you have GOT to freaking eat here if you like German food. Plus, the portions are HUGE! This is excellent drunk food which probably says a lot about Germans.and the desserts look amazing. I was too full to try one though. n nBringing on the atmosphere for all intents and purposes this place is an authentic Munich beer hall. They have family style long wooden tables and benches, there is a huge shelf along one wall loaded down with steins, and a guy comes in and plays live music and gets loads of audience interaction. This is a very enjoyable place to come and eat it's a little pricey look to spend at least 30 per person if you're drinking , but it's definitely worth it for tourists and locals alike. I can't wait till Oktoberfest to see this place come alive. n nThere are also spankings and contests. Be intrigued.",2

"Before I ever went in to noodles I was like ""oh yeah, I get it, it's a little healthier than like chipotle or antonio's, and it has lots of noodle dishes, sounds like a good idea to me. "" Then I actually went for lunch one time. There was nothing on the menu that looked at all appealing too much broccoli in everything I'm a hater, so I ordered the mac 'n cheese because it was the least healthy looking option and therefore had the best chance of being tasty. I got it with ""steak "" which cost like an extra 10 or some shit. It was so expensive! n nMy macaroni and cheese came out, and it was so bland I put sriracha in it. The ""steak "" was not worth the ridiculous 10, and was barely identifiable as any particular type of meat. n nIt gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it has air conditioning and is clean.",1

"I am extremely disappointed with the service. Both of my dogs are poodles and were not cut correctly. My dogs have been to this groomer at least 4 times and they did not follow the notes from the last 3 visits. Both dogs no longer have full ears, the groomer cut the ears too short and trimmed down the top knot so now they have flat heads. They did not follow the Mohawk for my male dog and completely trimmed it down to nothing but a flat head and small line down the base of his back. I spoke with one of the owners who mentioned he didn't know what he can do to help me, Really?! ! ! Never going to this place again the owner offered no money back and told us to request a groomer so the other groomers don't mess up!",1
"For all you folks who need coffee to go with your turpentine, Cartel is the place for you! n nFor the rest of us, I hate to pour cold coffee on the Cartel parade, but I just am not feelin' the love. I ordered an iced cafe mocha. The resulting lukewarm concoction tasted like a very strong brew of chocolate infused cardboard. shiver To tell you the truth, it was vaguely reminiscent of chicory coffee, which is not my ""cup of tea, "" so to speak. I even brought my younger, hipper friend to Cartel to make sure my evaluation was fair, and she now makes a face whenever I mention it! n nTry it if you must, since we all like to support our local businesses, but don't blame me if you don't like it.",1
I was disappointed once I got seated. Food was ehh and the cleanliness was not good. Our server was new so the forgetting parts of our meal was explainable but she made it up by getting us to go drinks. I wouldn't come back again.,1
"Checked this place out last night with a bunch of Twitter peeps and was really pleasantly surprised! It's got that slick downtown look but the kitchen is kicking some amazing pulled pork sliders! nThey weren't the shredded up, over sauced bit I've come to associate with pulled pork these were closer to sliced pork, with a tangy cabbage greens topping and were simply tasty. At 2, pretty darn big, too. I ruined mine by trying to eat with a knife and fork though just hoist it up by hand, potential sauce stains be damned. Fries are crispy and well seasoned too, and look to be hand cut. nThe owner has a great backstory as well I was told he went out of his way to hire people who were unemployed. Not transitioning to another job, but who had been looking unsuccessfully for work for months. Well, he sure picked the right ones because the food is great, the staff is friendly and the service is quick. This is going to be a lunchtime staple. nAnd it's right off the seventh street station, so you don't have to futz about parking, but if you do, they validate? Love!",2
"This was my first and last time at this restaurant. I thought Tessaro's was some sort of Pittsburgh landmark and I've heard rave reviews of their burgers. The burger I got was undercooked. I ordered it well done and it was definitely pink in the middle. But I didn't send it back because I never send anything back. I just ate it and it was a sloppy, greasy mess. The bread was cheap and tasteless. The home fries were just diced potatoes. That burger sat clogged in my stomach for 3 or 4 hours. And I had to make a few runs to the bathroom because I thought I was going to make a mess in my pants. Burger king is a lot better than this place and at a fraction of the cost. What else you got Pittsburgh? This better not be the best you got.",1
"I stopped at Ehrhardt Schwinn asked if they could switch out my flat pedals for clipless pedals which I already had . The older man there said it would be 10. 10? To turn a wrench? I usually go to Landis on Southern awesome place! everyone should go to Landis on Southern! and it literally took the guy at Landis 30 seconds to loosen the pedal, remove it, tighten the other one in for FREE. I have since bought the long handle bike wrench myself but at this time I was still learning couldn't get the pedals off. This is NOT a 10 job and I am offended that a bike place would be so profit driven to insist on me giving them 10 to turn a wrench. That is NOT how you make keep customers in the long run. n nLittle did the guy know I was actually planning on purchasing a laptop pannier while I was there. Too bad he lost out on a potential 100 sale for a 10 wrench turning charge. When I told him the place I usually go to does it for free he pointed to the kid working on a bike behind the counter said ""this guy doesn't work for free! He has to buy groceries too!

"Westin is a chain, and thus you have expectations which in this case were met comfortable beds, good in room coffee, and a environmentally unfriendly but very appealing double shower head. n nNow, for the reasons why this hotel fails for a 4 star Westin hotel n1. FOOD. The restaurant Ember, Bar 10 is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples Omelet 18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms Breakfast buffet the reason I got the omelet is typically left to become stale and lukewarm Dinner choices are typically salty i.e. Fattoush salad and greasy i.e. sandwiches and burgers . I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes . n n2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere even a pharmacy . Need I say more? n n3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but ""Try Ember, "" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential i.e. washcloth or soap . n nIf this were a cheap, sub 100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one.",1

The yummy whole wheat crust is awesome. Baked on the stone. My mouth is watering just typing up this review. n nI have to admit that I love having a server that is passionate about something and it shows.

Luckily the restaurant has a good layout and there was plenty of seating. We were greeted warmly, seated and our drink orders were taken swiftly. I ordered the spicy miso ramen. For an extra dollar you get 50 more ramen, so that decision was a no brainer. n nThe food came out quickly and upon first taste I practically did a happy dance. The broth was perfectly seasoned. The flavors were well developed, flavorful and had juts the right spice level. The noodles were the perfect texture and I slurped my meal happily. n nService was solid. Our drinks were refilled regularly and the servers were extremely attentive, always asking if we needed anything else. Definitely a five star experience. I can't wait to go back again soon.",2

Finally this sunday I had to be in that part of town around noon so we decided to drop by for breakfast first. n nAs I understand it, this place used to bevery small with a few tables. But i guess because its popularity has surged they have had to expand. We started in the bsitro area where we ordered a ham and turkey croissant.

After my most recent visit I got home to find big clumps of mud still stuck to the steps and flaps on my truck how can anyone miss that?!? The price is on the higher end of usual, so I expected more. I have one more pre paid wash coupon and won't be back after that's used.",1
Got to get a kronut croissant donut .,2
"I just want to update in response to the ""owners "" note. This in fact is a legit review, I visited the spa in March and had this exact experience and if your records do not reflect that you have yet another issue. n nJust as a lesson I would encourage you to reach out and try to answer issues politely, all in all this isn't a horrible review, I likely would have given it another chance. Now though you've made the matter worse and my decision will never change and I will absolutely not be returning. n nOne last update, if I'm not in your system why did you email me a birthday special this month? Oh and this is after I've opted out of your mailing list. n nAll around bad business happening at this place. AVOID!",1
I don't get the rave about this place. I don't understand how it has survived all these years. The prices aren't the highest I've paid for steak my all time favorite spot is CUT in LA but the prices are so high especially for Vegas where your dining dollar tends to have very high returns. I was a bit disappointed and discouraged really from the moment we were sat in some testosterone infused wood paneled room with four flat screen TVs playing ESPN. WTF I thought I was at a steak house that was going to cost me upwards of 150 per person. But my surroundings were very much collegiate Dennys. I lost my appetite. The wine list was enormous and lacking a sommelier. It was hard to find a wine under 100 and most were over 200. Ridiculous. They wet age their meat. I'm a fan of dry aging. The negatives just go on. Skip it. There are plenty of steak specials in town for 15 if you're looking for meat stick to that and use the difference of 150 on some nickel slots instead.,1
"We were at the Imperial Palace to see a show, so thought we'd eat here after seeing an advertisement. It was convenient to the show. Food was just okay, nothing to brag about. I've had better. My husband ordered Kimchi stew. I had some flavor, but nothing I'd order a second time. I ordered stir fried noodle with chicken. I needed a magnifying glass to find the chicken.maybe four or five very small pieces smaller than a walnut. Flavor was good, noodles and stir fried veggies good. Again, nothing to brag about. 3 for one tea bag and hot water.a little pricey. Skip this place there's a burger place on the next floor down.",1
So of you're in the mood for something different the southwest chicken Philly sandwich is fantastic!,2
Looked slammed.But.SURPRISE! No wait. Friendly people. Quickly acknowledged. Maybe we are in the calm before the storm? Parking lot suggests the area restaurants are slammed. nLove the chips n salsa. Don't come that often. But almost always enjoy myself.,2
"I've been going here since they've opened. I love them so much I made Dallas G open this Yelp account for me just so that I could rave about what a spectacular job Amy does for me every time. The staff is super nice, polite, efficient, and talented. I wouldn't consider going anywhere else for my nails. n nPedicures and waxing are equally awesome. n nIf it's not already clear, if you're looking for somewhere to get your nails done well and quickly, this is the place! Love them!",2
"I'd like to award this place with more stars, but our waiter was terrible. We were here late after driving in to town from Phoenix. A friend recommended this place, so we thought we'd check it out. The food was good. The bowl of berries listed as a breakfast side dish could be it's own meal. The berries were all big, fresh, and juicy. My wife enjoyed her breakfast crepe. n nUnfortunately, the service sucked. I don't know if it was because we didn't order alcohol or if it was because we weren't a group of 21 year olds in short skirts, but either way our waiter basically ignored us the entire time we were in this place. It took forever to get a glass of water and a Sierra Mist. It look even longer for him to bring out our bill and run my credit card. One of the hostesses, had to call him on her radio. I could understand if we were there during prime dinner hours and the place was busy, but less than half of the tables were occupied. I'm disappointed I can't give this joint more stars because the food was pretty good.",1
"Came here for breakfast. Dad told me that the breakfast is rockin'. However when my food came out to me it was cold.I ordered the biscuits and gravy expecting it to be better than what I can make at home. It was so cold that I had a film over the gravy, so when I told my server who was super nice and great, she brought it back to the cook. Now, what you're supposed to do is give the customer an entirely new plate. I was given back the same plate with cold eggs burnt bacon and the same biscuits and gravy with just more hot gravy poured on top, which of course just cooled the new gravy. I would suggest not coming here if you're looking for that meal. And to watch out for cold food that is not properly given back to you. n nThe two stars they have goes to the service. You guys are the meat and potatoes of this joint and you rock. The cooks.not so much.",1
"Quality and service is terrible here. There is way many better Italian food restaurants in the valley. n nI got the egg plant parmesan and it looked like my 7 year old tried to make it or it came from a box. The sauce was so so. It's definitely more of a tourist attraction or a place for people who haven't eaten real Italian food. Save your money, get a can of Chef Boyardee. It tastes way better!",1
"I've eaten here at least 4 times and I always try to stop by here when in Vegas. First off, their food is fan freaking tastic. The steaks are high in quality and worth every bite. The seafood is as fresh and tasty as if they were cooked right from the net cages they were caught in. Secondly, their customer service is outright stupendous. I booked the private room for a party of 8 and all our food came out perfect except for myself, which unfortunately was over cooked then came back way under cooked. While everyone elses food was good and almost finished they apologized to me serveral times when I wasn't too mad anyways. They comp'ed the whole 600 meal, when I didn't even imply for it to get to that, without flinching. We were all floored and left a 200 tip anyways. I've been back a couple times afterwards and loved my steaks seafood. Zero hesitation to go back.",2
"By far the best deep dish pizza in champaign. If you are from the suburbs and have those ""lou malnatis cravings "" this is the place to go! You cannot go wrong with the sausage.",2
I was in this Starbucks yesterday and ordered a frappicino. I asked for 2cups to help keep it insulated and frozen longer in this AZ heat and the girl at the register snapped. She first said I could only have a sleeve and the when I said I would pay for the second cup she preceded to tell me how un environmentally friendly I am. How inappropriate and out of line. I will be sending a letter to their coroporate office,1
"We had an amazing experince. The server was the best server we had in Vegas. I do have to say that the service in Vegas all together is horriad and that this place made it up two fold. Our waitress, Su Youn, was AMAZING. She had recomendations and shared with us all her favoriates. The atmosphere was great with a jazz band in teh background, and the ambiance was very nice. Its in Harrahs, which I would of never guessed to pick this place. We only picked it because it was in the same place ag ""Defending a Caveman "". Which was also great . I woudl highly recommend this place.",2
"I've never been to this place when its poppin. Its 3 story and the top is outside so thats cool, but still nothing special. The one thing I can say is they have these drink pouring things. but theres no pouring that happens. they pop it down on these.nozzles? I guess and fills the cup. but its really cool",1
Who would have thought a Philly Cheese Steak on a pita would be great. Try it and see. Chicken Souvlaki sandwich is great. Good to know a great place for lunch.,2
"I should have known when we tried three or four other restaurants within a mile of this place and they all had 1 2 hour waits, and this one had no wait, that should have been an indicator! This is a place for people to go, when they want a really nice atmosphere, with decent service, but don't really care about quality food. For the prices, 100 to feed my family 2 adult meals, 1 app, 4 kids meals and 6 soft drinks, no alcohol, no dessert , the food should have been much, much better. Every thing taste pre made, like out of a can or jar, not pre made at the restaurant. It wasn't bad food, just way over priced for low end average. I could have gone to Chili's and had better food for less than half the price. Or I could have gone right around the corner to Rooster's or Bricktops and for the same amount of cash, had excellent food. If the Village Tavern wants to see me again, I hope they took a picture, because I will never go back.",1
So far a 5 star I just purchased a used engine from them and have not installed it yet I hope it's worth every penny,2
"Seriously! I would never ever pay 50.00 for a pedicure EVER. Well again and I wouldn't have paid it this time NEITHER. We asked for pricing, I stated what I wanted and the only change i made from time of check in to done was that I now wanted french tips. Had I wanted to spend this kind of money, i would have gone to TheBathHouse. n nthe other thing that puzzled me was ""why, were they mopping the floor at 9 am in the morning, when the salon JUST opened "" Who really wants to be at a Salon when they are cleaning up yesterday mess.",1
"Ah, the little things I miss about living in Arizona. For instance, the Chicago Hamburger Co. n nWhat a gem. You'd drive right past this place without blinking an eye, just another dive place branding itself ""Chicago "" or ""New York "". NOT! n nThis is the best slider I've ever had. Holy crap they are good. Reminders of White Castle and Krystal burgers, except these are better. In other words, it doesn't have to be 4am while trashed to make them taste great. n nThe fries? PERFECTION. That right combo of crispy on the outside, yet nice and soft on the inside, not overcooked, not undercooked. The perfect fry. It's beautiful. It's art. n nWhere is Dorothy's slippers? There's no place like home.there's no place like home.",2
"This hotel is a world away from a 4 star hotel. The bathroom was filthy, full of other people's hair and who knows what else. The front desk said that the room had been recently remodeled, however the tile in the bathroom was cracked and full of mold, the toilet was chipped and the plastic seat was very uncomfortable. The complimentary shampoo etc was worse than a person would receive at a Motel 6 and the toilet paper was single ply, most rest areas on the highway have better. The swimming pool was closed however the hot tub was open which was also very dirty, full of leaves and cigarette butts. Extremely disappointing.",1
"Sushi. Well done and served with class. n nMizuya was the choice of our visiting friends. They liked to look of the restaurant and wanted to stay close to the hotel. We were seated immediately and the menu was explained, to avoid confusion in the ordering process. The server even offered to split checks, which made things very convenient . The portions were perfect, the chicken teriyaki bowl was very well prepared and the cocktail options were very interesting. n nThe prices are about what you would expect at a resort and honestly a bit lower than we were planning for. n nThe service was very good. There were a couple spills and some misunderstandings, but everything was handled professionally and we had a great time.",2
"Finally got to try this place today. We've attempted to come a couple of times but were deterred by the two hour long wait. We went in today a Saturday at about 4 45, and there was no wait! The tacos were really good. We especially liked the fish taco and the braised beef taco. The ahi taco was not impressive at all. The guacamole was pretty good. not amazing but good. Drinks were good. Loved their salsa that comes when they seat you. Very fresh! I'd definitely go back, but I would never wait two hours for it.",2
"Bear in mind that THIS La Cave is the one in the Paris, and is NOT the restaurant in the Wynn. There are still some conflicting reviews and pics in here, but don't be fooled. Try the other listing. Also, the pics are still incorrect on here. You got it! For the other place. n nThat said, I love this little shop. And if you like wine, how could you not? Lots of cookbooks, wine books, wine art, plates and trinkets. If you want to have nice things for wine events in your own home, this place works like a charm. n nAnd while I haven't tried all of their little foods, cheeses and chocolates, I have tried their pate. And I LOVE their pate. n nThe whole setting is charming, and fits in with the French exterior outside. It just looks like a quaint little shop nestled in the middle of a Parisian neighborhood, and it's a nice effect. n nIf you like wine, not just the drinking it, but the art and culture behind it, this is a great place to visit.",2
I've been here a few times and as much as the service is always awesome. I can't forgive them for what happened. n nIt was a beautiful day so the boyfriend and I decided to take the motorcycles out. We decided to stop by Home Plate. The previous times I've had the breakfast and you can never go wrong with breakfast any time of the day. But we felt like pasta and decided on the spaghetti and meatballs for lunch. Boyfriend decided to start with the shrimp. It was overly seasoned so we sent it back. The spaghetti sauce was also overly seasoned with pepper. But at that point I was hungry and just finished what I could. Plus we had plans for the ride and we didn't want to waste the day. n nLater that afternoon while riding near Boulder Highway I all of a sudden needed to use the restroom. I thought it was just me so I didn't think anything of it. But when boyfriend started to have stomach pains also we put two and two together and found the culprit. n nOur nice afternoon out on the bikes was cut short as we both raced back home. We will never be back.,1
This is a fun place to go but I would think twice next year for Halloween. We bought tickets on line ahead of time and that line was taken up by the people that had to still buy there tickets. The lines were crazy and the place inside once we got inside it was just as crazy but fun. One time is good enough for me and my family. Every1 should go at least one time. Remember if u have a stroller its not as easy to get around in the dark.,2
Go early in the morning to avoid the after work crowd but there are hotties everywhere!,2
Great place! Got my laundry done fast.,2
The Keno is Goooooooooooooood! Won 5G,1
"I wanted a good non touristy spot with great food so after reading a bit about this place we decided to come for brunch. It was a weekday and the place was pretty busy with the lunchtime crowd but we were still able to get a table as soon as we got there. After sitting down and getting a quick introduction from our server my impressions of the place was immediately favorable. It was obviously a local joint and the atmosphere reflected that. There were quite a few regulars there as evident from their familiar interactions with the staff and with the friendly service I knew that if we were locals we would be regulars here too. n nAnd of course the food was delicious! My boyfriend and I shared the shrimp and grits and the corned beef hash. Both plates were amazing in that comfort food goodness kind of way. I loved the chunky corned beef and the way the grits were seasoned was just perfect! The toasts that both plates came along with was also good and you'd want an extra helping to sop up the creamy grits. Last but not least, the coffee was really good! I thought I'd be disappointed that they didn't have an espresso machine but we liked their coffee so much that we ended up buying a bag! Turns out they use beans from Mothership Roasters, a local roasting company that sources single origin beans. Yup, exactly my kind of place. We were definitely happy to have found this place!",2
Was not impressed. Server was rushed. Food was low budget. Tasted like instant potatoes. Waitress admitted the Green beans were canned. Peas in chicken pot pie were canned as well. Have had much better experience at their ST George location.,1
This is a great place for pizza and beers. The owners and staff welcome you as you enter and make you feel right at home. Good food from Pizza's to salads. Some cool art work on the walls too by local artists.,2
This spot was our savior during our stay at the Venetian. Service was good and the food was good as well. Killer salad dressing made from scratch and the pizza and pasta we ate was delicious. I would come back even if I weren't staying at the Venetian!,2
I love the 5 and diner over by the 10 off Ray Road ans so we decided to check out this one at the Chandler Mall. n nA disastrous breakfast decision. While the service was friendly enough the food was terrible. I have no idea how one location can be so bad compared to another a few miles away but we will never come back here. n nThere were hardly any diners on a Sunday morning when most other breakfast joints are jammed so I guess that should have been a warning sign from the beginning.,1
Great name and staff. Average coffee.,2
"First and foremost, I LOVE mexican food! I eat it at least once or twice a week. I have had the pleasure of enjoying many home cooked mexican dishes with my mexicano friends and I have traveled deep into the heart of Mexico experiencing many different flavors and styles of mexican food. My love affair with mexican food is well developed. To be quite frank, the food at Amado's is BLAND for the norte u00f1o style. Especially when compared to Filiberto's, which probably explains the usual Amados crowd. This place is always packed with drunk highschool and ASU jocks every Friday and Saturday night, complete with the occasional highschool spar that draws police. So the late night bar crowd should beware, this place is a night in jail waiting to happen. This is why they have security cameras aimed right at you as you order. The best thing going for this place is the little salsa bar. I am staying loyal to the near by Filiberto's which is much more relaxed, more flavorful and has a drive thru.",1
"Dear vegan schnitzel, let's have a baby together. n nSeriously. I'm not a vegan. I'm not even a vegetarian, but I really enjoyed the schnitzel at Green Owl. The serving was on the small side, but seriously America, the serving sizes you get at most restaurants are TOO BIG. I did not leave hungry, especially since the schnitzel comes with veggie, roasted potatoes, and either a soup or house salad. n nBoyfriend got the crabby cake po' boy, which he enjoyed. He also pounded down his fair share of a vegan chocolate cake. I thought the cake was a little too dense, but I'm not usually a chocolate cake gal. The frosting was nice though. n nThey have an interesting beer selection at good prices, but luckily for me, I decided to pass on the booze and try the orange blossom lemonade. It was heavenly. n nI love the decor and all the cute little owls. Hipsters would swoon.",2
I'm not certain how this place will stay in business.maybe the hotels around it will help. We've given Marie's 3 chances each time I went there was a laundry list of items that they were out of or their 'pie guy' didn't show up to make the pies. Prices a bit expensive for very bland food. I had high hopes for this place.,1
So horribly misplaced in this classic casino. I so hope the new owners make efforts to rip it out and reorganize this whole large section of the casino.,1
What can I say we were in Vegas for 7 and staying at harrahs we would have been better off at the bar or gambling.,1
"I love Nutrition 101! The Smith family make it easy to feel good about yourself! I know lots of people think that they are just trying to fill their pockets but they are truely into changing the eating habits of society today. I am always there on the weekends because it is just fun to hang out and socialize. Oh and the owner is Maurice, not Carlos. Lots of people assume before actually giving them a chance. Come in and see what you get out of your visit!",2
"The menu looked promising but my experience was disappointing. The 2 star review is based on the fact that it was simply not worth it. The food was good, but I'm not sure why I paid 42 for 3 medium size scallops with a hash cake or whatever it was underneath them. No real side to speak of. n nGuest got the sea bass and it was okay for 45. n nSame with the mac and cheese which is actually deep fried mac and cheese bites with truffle cheese sauce , just okay. n nI got the gist that it was a restaurant with Bellagio prices for small portions of 3 4 star food. If you're willing to spend the money for fine dining I would go elsewhere. n nAnd I don't really rate the service at most places but it wasn't good. After I got the drink menu we waited almost 10 minutes for the server to show.",1
Unfortunately we haven't been able to get back recently but we have gone a few times since my original review. I've been meaning to update but keep forgetting. .so here we go.Sushi Koma is still our go to place. Every time we visit we walk out happy and our tummies are even happier! The staff is just as friendly as can be. The food has never been a disappointment. We have recommended Sushi Koma to lots of people and always get good feed back. Keep doing what you're doing! We look forward to our next visit.,2
"I really wanted to like Coach Willies, it's nice inside. n nThe service was terrible good looking gals with bad attitudes that move like molasses in winter, bleh. n nThe food? I had a loca burger and it came with this thick layer of cheese on top of it that my steak knife could not penetrate. The fries were shoestring fries that had been cooked way too long and were pointless to eat. I boxed it up and then carelessly left it in my car for two days.",1
"This restaurant is amazing! The servers are prompt, courteous, and efficient. I was incredibly impressed. This place might have the best value for your dollar in tempe. The bartenders are also awesome. Brandon was exceptional and very personable.",2
"Not being from Chicago I can't say that this tastes like the real thing BUT I can say that I was delightedly surprised everything was delicious! Service was great! Tomatoes in my salad were ripe, red and sweet.",2
"Never disappointing! We have visited this location several times and have never been disappointed by the food or service. Service can be a little patchy, however never anything bad enough to warrant complaint. The food quality and quantity is excellent. Salads and steaks are always perfect. The price is right! Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.",2
"I couldn't bring myself to eat at this restaurant a term I use loosely for this place . It was sketchy outside, and even more so inside. First, this is a house, which most of the restaurants are on this street. it was rundown, the grass was dirt, stray animals wandering about and the inside had no decor whatsoever and was dirty. it seemed to me that were no standards. I'm an adventurous person, and eater, but no way was I going risk eating here.",1
"What a horrible venue to go to if you want to see your favorite band play. n nIf you aren't lucky enough to get floor seats, don't even bother purchasing tickets to a show at this venue. It's lame because once floor seats are sold out, you have no choice but to find seats closest to the stage. What's retarded is the fact that there is so much floor room and the capacity could clearly hold more than is sold, and yet they restrict the amount of floor tickets available. Actual seating is so far from the stage, you're better off not attending at all. Typically, for large concerts, venues normally display large screens to zoom in on the artists playing however, Mandalay Bay Events Center does not. n nIt's bad enough that Vegas has an almost nonexistent music scene but to add horrible venues, that just tops it off.",1
Typical downtown Starbucks nice seating and the fact they have free wi if is always a good thing! Within walking distance of businesses very. Busy friendly staff and always accurate orders with fresh ingredients,2
"Great night out at D'Vine Wine. We'd visited the wine bar that was here formerly and while we enjoyed it, we didn't come back because of the prices, the ambience a little too shoulder to shoulder and lack of food on the menu. n nD'Vine Wine has taken a great space and upgraded it. We purchased a discount certificate on restaurant.com at 80 off using a coupon code, so we had a 25 off certificate for just 2. We picked up a 20 bottle from their retail area just around the corner, which our bartender corked and poured for us at cost, which was another great bargain. n nA bottle of wine, two full glasses of their bar wine, an appetizer, two mains and dessert cost us, all told with an 18 tip which is added automatically via the coupon and frankly is still 2 lower than what I would normally tip for such good service was 75. You can't beat that for a decadent night out where you don't pay attention the prices and just go a little ""wild "". n nService was great. The space is more open than it was before with the previous bar, the live music was jazzy and perfect and it was just stellar. We will be back, and frequently. One star deducted only for the slightly under represented appetizer and dessert. Both were great but seemed a tiny bit thin based on the descriptions. Nothing worth to bother about.",2
"Glass Nickle isn't just for pizza. Try the carryout salads. Start with any of the listed salads and then customize to your hearts content. Chef salads are a great place to start. My son orders the caesar salad adds chicken and is set. The toppings are fresh plentiful. Add in your one or more of the 15 choices of dressings, croutons, normal or extra amounts, fork or no fork. Your dinner is sent and is cold, crisp and ready to eat. nIf you order the large expect to eat it for 2 meals.",2
Wonderful food! Excellent service! Great lunchtime atmosphere!,2
"Tried to avoid chains last year but people invite us to them , and, well we can't be dicks all the time. The last experience I had at a Carrabba's in Scottsdale was pretty good so let's try the one in Glendale, n nQuickly seated, drinks, and appetizer were great. The soup, Spicy sausage and lentil was so good I looked up a copycat recipe for it . The goat cheese and pomodoro sauce brushcetta had us feeling all happy and relaxed. n nthen n nmain meal arrived. Wife's meat was not medium, not even close you could get red out of it. n n Neither myself of the kid had cutlery so it took a while to get a waiter to stop to remedy this. This interval turned my veal marsala into a gelatinous mess when cold. It tasted of flour and barely of marsala which I can make about 23 times better at home. n nWife's dish was re heated it well done with black hightlights .Not a new meal. Now it's heavy on the grill flavor. Spoke to manager Heather , she came to us, but I can't ask for more actually I told them to leave it on the check than they drop it. The kids meal was great! but they ruined the evening , seriously a dessert ain't going to count two messed up entrees n n2.5 rounded down.",1
Always good food and service. And at reasonable prices. You just can't go wrong at this restaurant.,2
 9 pie with fees and tax was 13. Took an hour to get delivered. And it tasted like garbage. Highly encourage anyone to avoid this stinkhole. Even the delivery guy was a dick.,1
"Great chips, but, way too salty. I'm drunk right now and they are way too salty.",1
40minutes and still waiting for one slice of cheese they told me it would be ready in 25 when I called,1
"Excellent dining experience. Very random that the restaurant is located in the gift shop of a salon, but once you take a bite of the food you really don't even notice or care. The Chef cooks in an open kitchen which I love and the server was great. My bf ordered the 5 courses and I ordered 4. It was perfect for the two of us. We split everything so got to try a good majority of the menu. We loved it all! Definitely check it out soon!",2
"It's very pitiful that I have to give a 1 star to any restaurant or business. But this place deserves it. n nBurger King hasn't really been good for anything, really. The fries stink and are usually cold, and the burgers have spots with color. I really have no idea what it is. n nThe few times that I've been to this location, we've only gone through drive thru. The dining room always looks closed. There was one instance when I pulled up to the speaker, and no one answered for about 2 minutes. I drove around to the window, and the lady didn't really apologize and just took my order. n nI really didn't know what I was supposed to expect. The food always sucks, and so does the customer service. I won't be going back.",1
I don't know if it's only because its the brossard location but this location is very quiet. You can easily shop around with no hassle. They are very upkept and the store is very clean and tidy.,2
"The Mirage is OK but this review is more about their gym, or lack thereof. n nHow can you have a resort hotel this size, with massive conference facilities, and have a gym that's so tiny? The gym consists of 6 treadmills, 5 stairclimbers, and 5 cross trainers. And 2 of the machines were broken. n nAnd there was a line out the door. Sooooo lame!",1
"No, just no! So mad! We've been going here for years. I think some of the menu items are absolutely delicious, some could be better. But nonetheless, this experience was a no. n nBreakfast for my family, two adults two kids, was 38. I was thinking, how is this possibly so high when I ordered one breakfast for me and shared it with my four year old, and all my six year old son had was a side of curly fries. Well I found it, 12 for kids drinks! Twelve. Dollars. My husband and I had water, and we ordered two kids milks. When they were gone, I asked if there were refills on the milks. I know most restaurants don't refill on that product, but some do. So when the server said there are no free refills of milk, that was fine. Then I asked if we could get something cheaper than milk, like iced tea, and she replied it was fine. n nWhen I got the bill, the teas were charged. I took the bill to the register and told her we shouldn't have to pay for tea after paying 6 for two 12 ounce milks. I told her the server did not inform us there was an additional charge. She called our server over and the server said ""I told them there were no refills on milk. "" I said, well I took that as there's no refills of milk, and I asked if something cheaper could be the refill, and you said it was okay. I told them you should have said, I can get tea but it will be an additional charge, and I would have said never mind. n nEither way, they we're rude about it, and dishonest. Because I pointed out that we were charged almost 3 PER cup. That is the adult price on a drink. She said it's the same size. I informed her I've worked in a restaurant. Those are 12 ounce cups and if that's what you charge for a 12 ounce drink that is a huge rip off. Tea is water and leaves, it shouldn't be that much for an adult or kid. A kids milk shouldn't even be 3. Rip. Off. It takes a lot to make me upset at a business or someone doing their job, but I don't appreciate the attitudes or a 38 bill for two breakfasts and a side of curly fries.",1
"Great burger, big thick shakes and right at the edge of the mall.",2
I like this location because it's not too busy and they always has tables outside the store so I can enjoy the latte and cigarettes with my friends.,2
"LOVE it! I have eaten here about ten times now, and it is a pretty new restaurant, so that is saying something especially since I am a very picky eater. At lunch you can either have the buffet or order from the menu at dinner you order from the menu. Many of the items on the lunch buffet vary from day to day some days there will be chana masala, some days vegetable korma, etc. It's always great. I actually like ordering from the menu better, though. The owner is a very nice guy and works hard to make sure his customers have everything they need. I have introduced several people to this place, and they all come here regularly now. And some of them are pretty picky people, too.",2
"I loved this place. I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, food, service, selection, and the drinks. Great place all around and a must try. Go out and try something new try Kava!",2
"very good food. very nice ambiance. nice drinks specialties. I'd have preferred to be seated downstairs but that is a personal preference I guess. If you are in the neighborhood anyway this is a good solid choice with some generous tasty tacos, great beans and garlic y rice. n nTaking all that into account, we don't live nearby and there was nothing magic to draw me to come back. There's nothing wrong at all with the service, quality or presentation just no sparks.",2
"I give this place two stars just because you have a great view of the entertainer your going to see here. This Venue is nice because it's small and they do get some really good acts that pass through town here. Other then that, I find the seating is way to small and uncomfortable, and location to be in a shady area of town. Drink prices are way to high and the sound at a couple of the shows I've been to hasn't been great. If someone I really want to see comes into town here, I'll force myself to be super uncomfortable, and deal with it. But they've got to be someone I've been really, really wanting to see.",1
"I thoroughly enjoy this library, and feel as though it offers many wonderful services, especially despite many city wide budget cuts. The building itself is very modern in architechture, and has wonderful open floors with great floor to ceiling windows. Taking a trip to the top floor and watching the city from the north and south facing windows can be an afternoon of entertainment in and of itself. They also have wonderful individual workstations on the top floor, a very accommodating teen center on the fourth floor, and a very large children's area on the first floor. As far as services go, there are plenty! The reading program for kids is now offered throughout the year not just in the summer anymore , there is the culture pass program tough to get tickets, but cool that they're free , assistance with college applications and financial aid, classes to learn basic computer skills free! , free internet access on their computers or with your own wi fi , and a really cool summer schedule for kids that is also free! I also really like the email alerts that I now receive, reminding me when my books are due this has saved me from late fees many times! If it strikes your fancy, there is also a cafe and a small bookstore, though I have never frequested either. n nSo why not five stars? Well, in the end, this is a library, and place to find books and other materials, and considering this is supposed to be the main hub for all the Phoenix Public Libraries, I sometimes find they are lacking in some of the information I am looking for. Also, while I understand that money is tight everywhere right now, the hours are sometimes less than convenient.",2
Pretty boring and not very entertaining 15 mins for the whole thing. Don't waste the money,1
"Great ambiance. Great service. However, the food fell a little short. While the salmon was an excellent dish, the NY Strip fell short. The steak was dry and overcooked, and the shrimp were fishy and undercooked. For the price point, it was a bit disappointing.",1
"This place was horrible. Did not, even for a moment, have a seat on the chairs while i waited to board the next train. The walls were dirty, nasty and dingy. It smelled awful inside. It was quite crowded. And I just did not like my surroundings. n nAnd dont let me get started on the restroom. after seeing the filth in here, i decided to walk down the street at 5am in the freezing cold to the greyhound station nearby to use their facilities. n nThere was absolutely no type of cafe or even little convenient store within this station to grab a bite to eat while you wait. I did find a vending machine to get coffee but even that was watered down. n nThis place needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the bottom up. I waited with my family down the street at a different station before we had to be back to board our train. n nI will be sure to not have this place in any of my future stops. Not a good way to sell the city.Horrible! n nThe only reason why i give this station 1 star is because the train itself was quite comfortable and clean.",1
"This location has been many different restaurants over the years this is a tough spot. This is my favorite thing it's been though. n nThe food is great here and the owner is cool. The prices are really reasonable and the portions are large. The place is really clean and the decor is nice. Everything is cooked in plain sight, so there's no mystery. n nMy only complaint would be that he doesn't deliver yet. We definitely need a good gyro place that delivers in the area. n nSeriously though the food is really delicious. If you like flavors it's all really flavorful. Great hummus too. Try the pizza puff.",2
"The venue, LED wall, and sound system is top notch. There was actually quite a bit of space to move around in. There were fun acrobatics and Cirque performers at random moments. I recommend either getting a table or going with all females or arriving super early if you don't want a 1.5 hour wait. I will go again.",2
"OMG the service here is HORRIBLE. We probably waited a good 30 40 min to order our food. The drink lady came around fast and asked us what we wanted but our real waiter was god awful. We had a sick baby with us and we needed to order him some food! n nWe were even able to flag her down a couple of times and ask her if we could order. She said hold on, I need to do this. I need to do that. She pretty much had to run someone else credit card. We ordered only a couple of things The granola, Cornbeef hash, and a Bellini. n nThe granola was a specialty, but I didn't think it was very special. The cornbeef hash was good and huge! It was like not crispy though. I like crispy cornbeef hash. The Bellini was awful! For 12 dollars NOT WORTH IT. It doesn't taste like peach at all. And it came in this really really small champagne glass. n nI will probably go here again if I stayed at Mandalay bay and it was the only place open 24 hrs but other then that. SKIP!",1
I can sum up my experience with this business in one word Understaffed. One staffer trying to assist ten customers is awful,1
"Clean, Organized Store with Friendly Service.",2
Very disappointed! I love a great steak and very much enjoy fine dining but the food here left much to be desired on both aspects. The oysters we ordered still had the adductor muscles in tact and the bone in rib eye my boyfriend ordered mid well was tough and had a good sized piece of gristle attached. My mid rare filet mignon and asparagus wasn't anything special. The martini I ordered had so much sugar the entire glass was sticky. The best part of my meal was the garlic mashed potatoes. The only reason I gave them two stars was because the service wasn't bad an the place is beautiful however that was somewhat ruined when they sat us right at the entrance to the dining area next to the bar which was quite loud especially when the restaurant was only half full if that. n nOverall the food quality lacked especially for their prices. I would not recommend the restaurant.,1
"One chilly Sunday AM that we happen to be on the Eastside of town, we dec'd that we wanted to have breakfast and try something new. My husband wanted to go to Ellis Island, always a safe choice and unfortunately, would've probably been better off going there. n nSo to start, it's downtown. Parking can be difficult, the crazies roam around deal with it, they're about to pass out to sleep lol. It was about 9 00am so there was a little bit of a wait, 20 mins for us. n nSERVICE We were greeted by someone who we thought was our sever, turns out she only brought out drinks, ok. Server finally made his way over to our table and he was a borderline D. We were greeted with a very bland ""Ready to order or do you need more time? "", took out order and we rarely saw him after that. Everyone else other than our server was attentive and very nice. n nSHRIMP GRITS Lacked the flavor that I was looking for. Lola's has their version of Shrimp Grits that blows this one out of the water. The shrimp was way overcooked, practically rubbery. Grits is flavorless so you have to add things to it to give it some taste and it usually mellows out a dish and takes on the flavor of the sauce that the shrimp is cooked in. Unfortunately, the grits muted the flavor of the shrimp rendering it to be practically bland and an all around disappointment. n nCHICKEN FRIED STEAK Tasted like it was a few days past its use by date, husband was so disappointed in it. n nPASSION FRUIT ICED TEA The best part of my meal. WTF. n nAMBIANCE Hipster and beyond. This is something that reminds me of what you'd find out in SF or SoCal. Menu's presented on clipboards, urban chic decor, great idea and if we went by ambiance alone, then this place would be 5 stars! Too bad, so sad it's not.",1
"This past weekend we were in Vegas and stayed at Mandalay Bay. We stopped at Citizens late on Friday night as we needed just a bit of food to get us through till breakfast. I ordered the grilled cheese which looked awesome but in reality, it was awful. It tasted bad from the get go and had me throwing up later that night. 11 for a grilled cheese that will make you sick? Ya, I think not. n nSunday morning on our way out, my girlfriends stopped there to grab a quick bite and it pretty much ended in the same result. NO one liked the food. Service was meh.Definitely don't think we will be going back there.",1
"Being Chinese, and having eaten Chinese food around the world and Phoenix, I'd say I've experienced the good, the bad, the decent, and down right scary. This is currently one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants in the east valley. They have a large selection of dishes listed on their American menu and Chinese menu, and much of it is prepared well. The dim sum is pretty good for Phoenix, AZ. You'll find more Chinese people eating dim sum here than any other in the east valley. That's a good sign that the food is authentic. It's a fairly large space and accommodates a fair number of people, but on the weekends there can still be a wait. Service is decent considering how busy they can get at times. Despite the fact that the restaurant has changed ownership several times, the food has remained pretty consistent. Pricing and portion size is fair.",2
"This hotel was terrible from start to finish! I normally always stay at Encore or the Wynn when I go to Vegas. However, this trip I decided to stay at the brand new SLS due to loving the one in LA and Miami and the price was about 100 less than Encore. Let me start by saying the standards of this hotel are nothing like the one in LA or Miami. From the very beginning the valet put a bad taste in our mouth. They did not even help 2 girls get their luggage from the trunk of the cab. The entire staff is rude and unhelpful. The second day friday my girlfriend was sick and could not leave our room. So I went downstairs to the griddle to order food to take us to the room, the hostess told me they do not do orders to go on Fridays. I told her ok I will sit down and order to food but I would like to have in a to go box because she could not leave the room. I had to ask for the manager just to be able to order some food. Like everyone else has mentioned, the hotel was not fully remodeled just patched over with new wall paper. The elevator system was poor you never know which elevator opens and it is old. The hotel is so far from everything on the strip. I will say there is alot of food options but nothing is healthy. The crowd is terrible and low class, I actually had a hooker in the same elevator as me. The rooms are tiny and the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything people are saying to you next door. God forbid you take a shower, the whole room becomes a sauna hot and humid, there is no ventilation. We heard good things about the nightclub but our experience at the hotel was so awful we did not even give it a shot. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for an experience like the one in LA or Miami. Very disappointed",1
"I tried. Twice. I just can't do it again. n nA large group of us went for Cinco de Drink. err, Cinco de Mayo. Partly because it's Mexican food, partly because of location, and partly probably the biggest part because of the specials and opening deals they offered. n nThe nacho specials weren't bad, but they were short lived. They are not still on the menu. While they were generally tasty, they didn't offer enough of the key ingredients i.e. meat choices, etc. and we were digging through the chips to find what we had ordered. n nThe service was bad. There's no other word for it. It was slow, even with multiple servers watching over our group and others. I had to go to the bar to order drinks more than once. n nI spoke with the manager, Amy, about it. She was great helping me set up our large group and after when I talked to her about our experience. She explained the situation staffing issues, temporary fill ins . While I found that understandable but not excusable, we discussed the possibility of another try. n nThat said, a month or so later I went back for a quick dinner in the hope that, outside of the ""holiday "" crowds, that it would be different. n nI was, again, disappointed. I opted for the custom nachos and my guest had the enchiladas. The nachos were small and expensive I didn't even add meat , the chips seemed stale, and the sauces and salsas seemed as if they'd been left out for a day. Her enchiladas were so spicy as to be almost inedible. n nThe waitstaff was slow and inattentive, and we had to flag down the waitress more than once. n nWe had to bring to the staff's attention that the restrooms hadn't been looked after in some time. n nI will not be going back.",1
Standard family diner. Nothing surprising here. A decent place to stop for breakfast.,1
"This place is so unprofessional. They employees have no manners and talk about their personal business very loudly. One of the employees told another that she was going to ""stick her food up her a if she didn't give her the right paper work "", another talked about her boyfriend in prison. After signing in I waited 45 mins for them just to get my insurance information. After that I waited another 30 mins to get my blood work. I don't mind the wait, I understand they have a lot of paper work but there was only two people before me. I just find it very uncomfortable to hear yelling across the office and it's all personal conversations. Very disappointed with the staff. Will never come back here.",1
"There were so many things wrong with this place. Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait 15 minutes to get seated after our scheduled time. First off, let me say that I have lived in Paris and other parts of France but it has been many years. n nAMBIANCE Eclectic decor, imagine black, white, and pink. Unfortunately, my view was of a huge flat screen TV in a gilded frame over the bar with a basketball game playing. If this ""embodies Aurore's vision of an original authentic restaurant "" I'd like to know what bistro in France she had in mind. I'll be going back to Paris soon, so I'll update my review if I am wrong. Also, not so classy to walk by an open tray of silverware health code violation? on the way to being seated, of which our hostess later was wrapping in cloth napkins ON the hostess station at the entrance as her side work. Upon being seated, table was bare NOTHING, no place setting, no candles, nada. What were we waiting for? n nFOOD I was a little surprised no pun in intended! to see Italian and other non French items on the menu such as lasagna and eggplant parmesan. I guess this is what they mean by ""classic French techniques with traditional American influences, "" but again, I'll let you know when I see meatloaf on a Paris bistro menu and eat my words. Forget about the mushroom appetizer READ VERY SMALL, as there are only 2 stuffed mushroom caps on the plate. Beforehand, I had asked the waiter if they were portobello, which at first he agreed but then retracted. I can see why. The foie gras was okay, but I would have preferred a seared version of this dish. n nWe waited OVER AN HOUR for our entrees to arrive. And even then, my filet, compared to the other diners at the table who ordered the same, was smaller and overcooked. The sauce was very nice and I can see how this was part of the chef's training. I also liked the potatoes au gratin. Unfortunately, this dish is very small for the price I've had airplane meals in coach bigger than this. Overall, this place is OVERPRICED. n nSERVICE Our waiter had a little bit of an attitude, so this was in line with an authentic French bistro however, his lack of efficiency and attention to our table was not. He never poured our wine even once after serving it and we never saw him during our long sojourn waiting for our entrees. After he dropped off the entrees, he NEVER came back to even ask how everything was. Actually, he never once asked how anything was. And at the end he only made excuses for why the kitchen could not handle such a busy night. So what's your excuse for poor service? n nGordon Ramsay would have a FIELD DAY with this place. Think Amy's Baking Company.everyone here must be in denial of how bad things are. And Ramsay would tear another one on the chef for arrogantly referring to this place as an authentic French bistro ""with reasonably priced food of very high quality served by knowledgeable and attentive staff. "" Maybe people in Surprise who have never traveled internationally or even eaten in an excellent restaurant may think this place is the balls, but she's not fooling me.",1
"its ""Carnaval Court Bar Grill "" so you can have food there just dont expect high quality. but then again who would from bar food, right? just your average salad, burguer, sandwich, nachos, etc nThe drinks on the other hand are good, average price 8, you can either sit at the bar and watch your bartender prepare your drink while he juggles bottles sings and dance or have a sit at one of the tables and just order from your waiter. the bands that play there are really good also, and you can dance all night long, usually there is 2 bands per night, one plays from 1 6, the other one from 8 1and then its time for the DJthat goes at it until like 2 or 3 am depends on the day it is n CC is open every day since noon . nTips n get there before the cover starts I think its like 830 n park in Harrahs n Tip good from the start n Make requests at the band, have a great time!",2
"Service at this location is on the decline. I used to be able to go in and see personal I knew and trusted, but they have recently been running through desk persons pretty fast, and I often feel like I have been given the run around upon leaving.instead of long term customer care, they only seem interested in the !",1
"As other yelpers have indicated, it is hard to not be deterred when you first pull up. The old building combined with the large Motel sign caused me to pause and think of going somewhere else. However, thanks to positive reviews on Yelp, I continued inside and had a very good meal. Pricing is very reasonable and the food is good. The service, although not the friendliest, was solid and my server checked on me often. I was in and out in about 35 minutes, but didn't feel rushed. Overall, I would recommend Miguel's for someone looking for a Mexican food alternative to the national chains.",2
"I am hooked on their chicken salad I get without the chips. It has lots of avocado and they way they do their chicken, the marination process, along with their hot sauce, makes this a good lunch salad for a reasonable price less than 5. The lady always remembers my order no chips. I enjoy seeing her friendly smile as I make my way through the drive thru.",2
I can think of no reason to go back here other than proximity to downtown.,1
"Bummer. nWent in for their ""grand re opening "" to see what took them a month to finish as far as remodeling went. Looks like paint and perhaps the loss of a liquor license? Crab legs no longer on the buffet for evening fare. 20 2 people with no option to just have water. Other than that, food choices look to be the same but quality has gone downhill. Bummer.",1
"OMG, FOOD POISONING! n n nAte here a week ago and I paid for it in the worse possible way. Everything was mislabeled and the waitress taking our drink orders was incredibly bitter. I didn't force her to work there! n nSave yourself and go to the Bellagio or Paris buffets. Now, THOSE are amazing buffets.",1
"A while back I bought a Groupon for Mi Peru because I've never tried Peruvian food before. And boy am I glad I did! This place is homey and quaint but don't let that fool you, their food is superb. I tried the deep fried yucca root, which ended up tasting pretty close to a french fry, and their house specialty Seco de Carne a pot roast type of dish that was absolutely delicious! My parents both enjoyed their meals fully, each of them tried a different type of kabob. I will definitely be heading back soon to try out their other specialties!",2
"Although immediately disadvantaged by having a Y chromosome, I still enjoyed this little boutique. Going along with my lady friend I could see the excitement in her eyes before we stepped through the doors upon seeing the love hearts outside. Offering clothes that are funky, hip and other adjectives from the 60s, there is a veritable feast of style in Trouv u00e9 as you'd expect from a shop with a 'quirky' French name hinting at thrift store chic . With cheap t shirts around u00a315 20 , skirts and dresses, there is a surprising amount of choice in this small store, largely down to the fact it is very well laid out. Pride of place are the vintage dresses about u00a375 100 and even as a guy I was impressed. n nIn addition to the clothes there are cool little nick nacks, jewellery and a good selection of shoes and bags, basically a girl's night out in one shop and who can say no to that. To add to this the staff are equally en vogue and have excellent product knowledge it looks like they actually care about the stuff they are selling which makes a nice change. n nThe only downside is that it is so popular with ma petite amie that I am not likely to stop hearing about it any time soon, which to be honest is not really the shop's fault. Vive la Trouv u00e9!",2
"4 stars for the interesting no name 24 hour pizza join hidden in the Cosmopolitan for their yummy pizza! n nCame here back in June after reading about it on Yelp. My one problem was that I really wasn't that good at finding anything that's ""hidden "". n nWell, lucky for me my boyfriend was around and it really wasn't that hidden. Just follow the smell of pizza and the trail of people with paper plates. n nSo it's pizza by the slice any way you want it and it is by no means cheap but it's Vegas and it's in the Cosmopolitan, are you really surprised? The pizza is really good, not top notch but pretty damn good. It's got that nice crispy crust with the ooey gooey cheese and whatever the heck you want on top. The toppings are fresh and delicious! n nSeating isn't great and depending on how busy it is it could be a hot mess. They've got counter seating and it's extremely limited. You can always walk it out to the couches down the hall and have a seat there. Boyfriend and I managed to score seats next to a couple of drunk idiots, but hey it's Vegas.",2
"This Qdoba location is better than most, but it's still Qdoba it's average. I enjoy the taco Tuesday deal 2 tacos , but you have to eat it in the store and can't take it to go. which I don't understand. This leads to more drink refills, more staffing, more cleaning. why not deliver the special and let people leave and get out the way? I don't know, its just a great idea with bad execution i suppose. Like I said. this place is the definition of average. nDespite it being average, the food here tastes fresh, but its a little over seasoned and everything is so watery. The tacos drip, the burrito drips, the salsa is watery. lots of water. Mexico would be jealous.",1
"This place was accommodating, fun and a great place for beginners as myself to try out guns that I'd never be able to even touch in California. The staff was very helpful. David helped us out and made sure to explain everything. He was right behind us, telling us exactly how to safely handle and fire each firearm. Everything was controlled and he gave tips on how to improve our accuracy. It was also my wife's first time shooting and they were all very nice and all of the workers went out of their way to make her feel comfortable and not pressured into shooting anything she didn't want to. She eventually tried out an M9 and a P90. nI tried the M9, MP4, M4 and AK. it was great shooting those for the first time, trying out the three round burst on the M4 and full auto was exceptionally fun.",2
"this place is awesome for a meat lover expensive though but its worth trying at least once if you love meat all meat is a tad salty but good the only thing that really sucks about this place is that for 46.99 per person soda, iced tea or coffee should be included but no they don't even refill your soda each soda 3 for 6.5oz size that is obscene but i say go try it any ways you won't be disappointed with the quality of the food.",2
"Since I got back from Asia it seems like the food portions here in the States have gotten bigger. Especially when I dropped in for breakfast at the Omelet House on Charleston. n nIt's been forever and a day since I last ate here and the parking sucks just as bad once the other businesses open up. The wait wasn't bad but there were a few larger parties that had to wait for their turn. I lucked out as I got there early enough and a party of one is easier to seat than two large parties. n nI don't like leaving food as much as I don't care for leftovers and the portions were so big that I ended up leaving a quarter of my breakfast because I couldn't take it to go because I'd be out and about all day and it probably wouldn't have kept. The breads are awesome which I know I ate too much of and the Omelet I had, pretty much the Denver, was tasty enough to where I didn't drop on any condiments, like hot sauce etc. n nService was ok but I think the fact that my face was buried in the paper was a sign to just take my order, bring my food, bring refills and bring my bill when I was done. I didn't need nor want much more than that. n nAnyway I was a fan back in the say I guess I still am. Just forgot about this place after all these years.",2
" Disclaimer, I haven't had the chance to eat here, and the reason is why I'm giving it a crappy review. n nI wanted to take my wife for a nice meal at a fancy place for New Year's Eve. Lots of people suggested Bentley's. n nI called to make a reservation last Tuesday December 18th. The person who answered informed me that they had a special menu that I needed to look at BEFORE making a reservation. I said great, and I gave her my emailed. Never received anything. n nCalled two days later to see if I could make a reservation again. I told the woman that answered that I had called already to try and make a reservation. I literally spelled out my email this time. She mentioned something about me having to look over the email and review the cancellation policy before making a reservation. Since I still wanted to eat there, I told her I would wait for the email and call her back the minute I reviewed it. n nIt's been a week now. No emails.",1
"On the opening day of the project, I had the chance to head to Victoria Square to try out Camion Au Pied de Cochon. Now I realize that this will be the 4th post I write about Au Pied de Cochon and its various off spring. The reason is quite simple. I love them that much! n nThe concept they are going for is salty and sweet. You order in the front and from there, you pick up your items from either the salty window and the sweet window. The menu is an blend of dishes from the Duluth restaurant, the Sugar Shack and some unique truck items. n nI went for their big combo option with an added item. That item was a fried duck leg with maple syrup BBQ sauce. Anyone who went to the Sugar Shack this past spring got a taste of this particular item. Nice tangy BBQ on top of some great duck. Nice crispy exterior while still keeping some moistness inside. Great option for only 3 ! n nThe combo box itself contained four times a maple soda, a foie gras poutine, a ""beigne Cochon "" and a ""beigne sucr u00e9 "". The maple soda was nice and refreshing with just the right amount of maple syrup flavor to make it sweet but not overbearingly so. This was one of the components of the Whiskey Soda I had up at the Sugar Shack. Still the best one I have ever had. n nNext up, the foie gras poutine their old restaurant classic and signature dish. If you've had it there then you know what to expect. They succeeded in translating perfectly to the food truck. Crisp golden fries, cheese curds, a piece of foie gras and their foie gras gravy perfect in the restaurant and perfect here. n nNow for the new stuff. The ""beigne Cochon "" really stretches the definition of a doughnut. In reality, this is a smoked meat sandwich where a doughnut is the bun. Yeah. You read that right. A doughnut bun. Picard and his team are just nuts man. Anyway, this sandwich was amazing. A very generous portion of pork smoked meat, white ham and pork tongue with some mustard sandwiched in between that doughnut. Great combination as the doughnut mimics a sort of brioche bread. Nice and golden with a good crust yet a soft interior. The perfect way to differentiate themselves in this food truck rush. n nFor the ""beigne sucr u00e9 "", they take the exact same doughnut but then stuff it with a filling of your choice and then add powered sugar. In my case, I went for the rhubarb option. Stuffed to the gills with a cream and rhubarb filling, the doughnut, which had been perfect for a sandwich, became a wonderful sweet treat to cap off the meal. n nA very strong entry to the food truck world by the Au Pied de Cochon crew. Keeps in line with their ""go big or go home "" style of food all while adding some new twists for the truck. Very generous portions at a reasonable deal overall I think. If this is indicative of what we can expect from this generation of Montreal food trucks, we will all be very lucky people. n nCheers!",2
This is my 5th day in vegas and decieded to try something different saw the ad for the machine gun experience and said this looks like fun. Well I have to say it was one of the best experiences I have had in Vegas yet. They have a free shuttle service and the driver John one of the nicest guys to meet. The staff is super you not only shoot the guns but they give you instructions. I have shot guns before but the tips they gave me I never knew. Thanks for a great experience.,2
"If you are what you eat.then I am a LARGE Pizza Pie! n nI had to give these guys a try, so in order to do this right I stopped by, looked around and placed a take out order, A slice of cheese, and a slice of pepperoni. n nNow, let's get this straight, Tony's is hands down IMO the best pizza in Ballantyne, and having read good reviews from fellow Yelper's Libretto's Pizzeria was bound to get my attention. n nThe building is unique in its present design layout, and why I mention this is that you cannot use the back door as an entrance. I had to walk all the way around the building, to enter the establishment. This has a nice outdoor patio, but very few seating arrangements in the bar front dining area. The back area, ie the main dining area is nice in that it is a little more formal, located behind the wine racks with white linens on the tables. n nAfter getting home, I tried the pizza, it was good, the crust was edible and not dried out like stale bread, and this warrants the opportunity of ordering a fresh large pizza, so that I may share with others. Based on the reviews of other Yelper's, I may just stick with the pizza, but as I see it, I eat enough pizza to to keep Libretto's and Tony's Pizza in business. n nNCFoodGuy",2

I wanted to like this place I really did. I had to go three times because every time they were out of Lamb meat. I am thinking it must be amazingly good if they keep running out right? So I go and order lamb meat gyro. I was expecting a meat loaded sandwich like the kind you get at every other authentic Greek place. I was sadly mistaken. Instead of the usual thin sliced seasoned lamb meat budging out of the sandwich I got mostly filler and a few cube cut pieces of undercooked red in the middle pieces of no taste meat. Yuck I wont be back. My advice go to a real Greek restaurant and pay the same for a much better experience.,1
"I emailed then twice in 8 days with no response, about an urgent matter asking why they won't accept debit transactions to pay for AVG antivirus. Their fraud dept called me and refused to honor it, claiming it's because AVG is in the Netherlands. I shop online all the time with international companies and use my Riverset card, no problem. This happened twice before and Riverset did an ""override "", but refused this time. I tried calling them big joke the phone rang and rang and rang then went to voicemail. Extremely poor customer service.

"Absolutely awful. Just finished a fantastic dinner across the street and were looking for a nightcap. Waited in line for 10 min to check our coats only to learn that our American money was 'of no value to them'. We were looking to hang out, have a bunch of drinks, and spend our hard earned cash. Epitome of arrogance and racism. n nAmericans or other out of towners, avoid this place at all costs. They are unwelcoming and unfriendly.",1
"I don't normally write reviews, especially on fast food restaurants, however ""Rice Trax "" is worth it. my family and i travel across town at least once a week to eat at this wonderfully new restaurant. They have really, really good fried rice, but i always order the tempura fried rice. They have awesome tempura! Better than a lot of sushi houses here in town and much more affordable. Their prices are excellent for the amount of food that you get! A definite ""must try "" place!",2
"The House at Secret Garden has quickly become one of my favorites! Alongside Marcellino, Mastro's City Hall and Lons at the Hermosa to give an idea of my taste . I was there again last night for dinner and have not been able to stop talking about it! n n Everything about this establishment is worthy of bragging rights the warm ambiance, the staff which is knowledgeable, welcoming and very friendly and the food.oh the food. n nGreat presentation, flavorful and always cooked to perfection! I've enjoyed the appetizers, salads, soups, main dishes and desserts! I have yet to find a flaw! When dining with friends or family we always each order a different dish and share so though I've only visited a few times I've had the pleasure of tasting many of their creative, tasty offerings. I'm truly unable to choose a favorite! n n I have to tell you about the cocktails I had the mango serrano mojito, delicious! There specialty cocktail list is just that, SPECIAL! A welcome twist to your typical. There wine list has something for everyone! I enjoyed a great Cab! I was slightly disappointed they no longer offered the Ballentine by the glass but this was a worthy substitute. n nI highly recommend you giving this great restaurant a try. If you're a foodie you will not be disappointed.",2
"Delicious. Great selection, and everything was very fresh. Solid cocktail menu with dinner, and the Chicken Grandmere Sea Scallops we ordered were plenty and very flavorful. Warm chocolate tart for dinner, and we had a delicious dinner dessert drinks for under 100. Not a bad deal if you ask me. n nSide note Sean was a great waiter. Very friendly, and he was extremely knowledgeable with the menu. Always refreshing to have that experience, seems to be a dying art form in restaurants today.",2
"When I was a teenager I worked at Garcia's Metrocenter. As a lowly busboy at the chain restaurant I learned about how restaurants work. The job also offered me up some amazing Mexican food and all the chips and salsa I could eat. In the years I worked there, those never got old. n nBack then, the operations were still watched over by the Garcia family, who had sold the name and concept to a large corporation. Today, the chain serves pretty much some of the most mediocre Mexican food around and many of their stores have closed. n nHowever, the Garcia family wasn't dumb they kept the best for themselves. The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas in Phoenix is still owned and operated by the Garcia family, as it has been for more than 50 years, and is not connected to the chain. Many of the dishes you remember eating as a kid can still be found and enjoyed here. n nFrom the outside, the building has lush landscaping and a separate building for takeout orders. The interior is reminiscent of an old Spanish home with low slung ceilings and lots of woodwork. The main dining room is cavernous, like walking into a Mexican courtyard, bright and inviting. n nOnce seated, guests are greeted with a bowl of hot tortilla chips and a cruet of mild chunky tomato salsa. It took me right back to my busboy years. If you prefer more spice, ask for hot sauce, which they will provide upon request. I enjoy mixing the two sauces for a tasty hybrid. n nTo take advantage of the salsas, a Cheese Quesadilla 5.50 is a must. I always ask for a side of lettuce and chopped tomatoes so I can adorn each crispy slice, then pour on some salsa. n nThe menu hasn't changed much over the years, which is a good thing. It's nice to know that you can always order your favorite dish, like my all time Garcia's favorite the Pollo Fundido 9.95 . They take stewed chicken meat, then wrap it in a flour tortilla and fry it until it's light and crunchy. It's topped with smooth jalape u00f1o cream cheese and slices of cheddar cheese then placed under a broiler until the cheeses are melted and bubbly. Served with rice and beans, each creamy bite is sure to please. n nThe Combination Appetizer 9.25 offers hearty miniature sized versions of Mexican classics. This plate includes miniature beef tacos, beef flautas, beef chimichangas, green corn tamale and refried beans. Give this plate a good dousing of salsa and it'll be hard to stop eating. Aside from the mini chimichangas, the cheesy green corn tamale really hits the spot with hints of sweetness. n nIf you can avoid eating the crunch flour tortilla shell, the Taco Salad 7 loaded with seasoned ground beef, might be a healthier choice. n nDesserts stick to the classics, such as Flan 4.50 and Sopapillas 4.25 . My favorite is Deep Fried Ice Cream 4.75 , a ball of hard frozen vanilla ice cream covered in honey and cornflakes then quickly fried so the outside is slightly caramelized and crackled. n nWhile I'll probably never go back to busing tables, the idea of all you can eat chips and salsa sure makes it tempting.",2
"I swear, people have the most disgusting palates in Vegas. n nI ordered the ""Crazy "" Alfredo advertised as a ""favorite "" . Crazy is right. Expired chicken, overcooked rubbery shrimp, and it all tasted like it was cooked the previous week, stored, and microwaved for service. nMy wife ordered spaghetti with meat sauce. How can you screw that up? I don't know how you can, but Nora's did. The sauce was watery and the meat chunks so small it can literally be drunk and not chewed. n nSeriously, my wife almost went across the street to Smiths to pick up a bottle of Progresso to put on hers. n nI tried this place once about a year ago and figured I'd give it one more chance. Never again. n nThis place seriously needs Gordon Ramsay to do his Kitchen Nightmares show. It screams outdated, lack of standards, and absolutely disgusting food. n nThere was one semi redeeming quality the store bought bread they served was loaded with roasted garlic. That was pretty decent.",1
"I have to say, I am always satisfied here. The service can be spotty, but it doesn't make itself out to be some fancy place. They are not known for the service, it's about the food. n nOne thing even when it was super busy and we were waiting for a while, the servers really hustle to get you what you need. One night the whole place was packed with one guy working the grill and the other guy in charge of the bar, tables, and register. He wasn't perfect but he was damn good. n nThe pastrami is my favorite and I highly recommend. You just can't go wrong with salty meat and fresh cole slaw in a sandwich loaded with fries. The downside is the Italian bread can get a bit soggy, especially on the side the sandwich is laying on. Very filling, even for a big eater. Sometimes I can only eat half. I like to get the whole pickle too, but it is large. 4 6 spears and I have to believe it's more than one pickle. n nThe biggest issue I have with this location is the bathroom. It's down a steep set of stairs and it's a big ol' effort to go. Also, they are not great about refills. Not sure if these things are related. n nAll in all, good food, good price. Highly recommend.",2

"I love the beer, but the service is not great. The bartender couldn't be bothered to explain the beers in a flight and walked away when we ordered a beer they were out of. Take note from birdsong and be thankful for your customers.",1
"Love love love this place! Went there for the first time for lunch yesterday. We were seated right away even though the restaurant was pretty busy. Took a while to get to order and the food didnt get out as fast as we would like, but man the food tasted so so so good. We ordered a wonton noodle and a beef brisket tomato stew noodle. They were so tasty and authentic! It's hard to find this flavor even in Hong Kong sometimes. n nEverything sounds good on the menu and we would definitely want to go back for more, especially their desserts. They offered Hong Kong style iced lemon tea, iced milk tea, mango pomelo sago sweet soup with ice cream.mmmmm.i can't wait to try that out! A solid 5 stars for the food! YUM! n nFYI there is a 15 minimum purchase for credit card use.",2
Not impressed at ALL . This place is so overrated Don't order the appetizers !,1
"Ok.so Sam's Cafe is probably one of my favorite lunch places to go in Phoenix, I would go alone just for the fresh made chips and salsa they bring to your table, the menu items here are quite unique and to say the least are good for the most part. n nEvery time I have been to this place they have never been that busy, but I will say there service is lacking, it seems that when ever I go there I get the dyslexic high school waiter who can't remember to bring me my refills I ask for or I get the recovering meth addict that hates life. n nI usually end up getting the mushroom and spinach casadia which never disappoints, I like this places ambiance, the only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the service always seems to blow.",2
"We attempted to go to a screening at this theater last night. It was an absolute mess. When we arrived, 45 minutes before the show time, we were placed into a line outside the theater that had about 10 people ahead of us. We were told this was the overflow line, that we would get in only if some of the people with tickets did not show up. We were told that other people with screening passes had exchanged their passes earlier in the day for actual tickets, and only if some of those people did not show up would we get in. Later we were told that everyone with tickets was already inside. About 6 30 p.m. 30 minutes before show time were we told it would be another 10 15 minutes before we would know if any of us were getting in the line outside was capped at 15, but 18 were in the line. A manager came out and said there are people who come to the free screenings every week and who know how the system works at different theaters and so they know how to get in. Finally, at 7 p.m., a manager came out and said there was not a single seat open. I asked the girl running the line, ""If every seat was taken, and all the people with tickets have been inside since you said, how did you not know half an hour ago that there were no open seats? "" And she says, ""We were still waiting for people to show up. "" Nothing they said made any sense, and everything they said was contradictory to something else they said. There was no reason for us to stand out there in line for 45 minutes. They should have just told us when we arrived that it was already full, if it was in fact full. Who knows what actually happened. But I will never go there for anything ever again.",1
Completely agree with Seth Y. on the smell issue. Other than that the green fees are reasonable as long as you don't mind golfing in the afternoon. Everything is very organized and well marked and the course is fun and challenging for players of all skill levels. I can't wait to go back and actually get to finish 18. Slow groups should be forced off the course! Grr,2

"Just the loveliest gem on a sunny Saturday morning. If you are planning to completely stock your kitchen with veggies and the like, you may want to plan your arrival right at 9 00am. It fills up fast with regulars, so many of the produce options go quickly. The choices in stock wax and wane depending on what's available for the picking, so if you don't find the variety you're looking for, maybe plan to split your time between here and another market. But come here for the experience. Come for the pastries, the coffee, for lunch, a bonfire and live music. This is truly a magical oasis humbly tucked beside the freeway, and a great way to enjoy the weekend. n nThe greens here are exceptional and usually plentiful. They often have staples like chard, kale or collards some variety of root veggies and lots of citrus. If you're early enough, you'll find carrots, radishes and tomatoes. When you're done shopping, plan to spend some time enjoying the lay of the land. Definitely check out the menu of the day there is typically soup plus another good plate du jour like pizza or stuffed peppers. I usually come hungry! Be sure to keep an eye out for a lull in the crowd, as the lines get LONG for both coffee and food. Haven't tried the juice stand, but it does look refreshing in warmer months. n nIf you're into maintaining your own little garden, they also have herbs plants, compost and mulch for purchase. While it might be slightly pricier than your national home store chain, this is ""native "" stuff, meaning it's fit for Arizona gardening important if you actually want your plants to grow. While other formal farmers markets might have a more steady variety of choices, there is nothing like traipsing around the actual farm and getting away from the morning bustle.",2

"I went here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. We were dining in with a restaurant.com coupon. There was no one else there when we arrived at 6 pm, but a few other people showed up as the meal went by. We selected a few different rolls, all were very well prepared and came out quickly. Some of the rolls were a little warm when the should have contained cold fish , but otherwise very tasty. The ingredient quality cannot compete with some of the bigger name sushi places in Vegas, both in freshness and preparation. Otherwise this place which is known online as M Sushi as well was pretty good. I would definitely come here again.",2
"Went here because I wanted authentic greasy stick to your ribs Mexican food. Unfortunately all I got was the greasy part. n nI ordered a combo enchilada and taco platter. The shredded beef was dry and the whole plate was just too salty. It came with an ample helping of beans and rice, which were tasty but nothing special. n nHowever I do have to agree that this place has great chips and salsa. And the wait staff is very generous with them. n nI just wish the rest of the meal had lived up to the chips.",1
"What a mistake to stay here.my Wife and I found a deal for 13.00 a night on the internet. when we arrived they gave a room in the south tower. that room had a bad smoke odor, the carpet had cigarette holes and filthy stains. pictures were stolen off the walls . bed was harder than a rock . loud construction noise outside our window. paint peeling off the furniture. filthy floors in bathroom. toilet ran all night. when we went to complain the next morning to the front desk they young girl who did not seem to care did not offer a refund and told us that we were put in a smoking room even though i paid for a non smoking one.her offer was to give us another room.when we went in there the bathtub had a bunch of black crap on the bottom. we went back to the desk and i demanded another room in which they gave us a room in the newer north tower. this place has gone downhill and they do not care about their guests",1
So i went here one late night freaking starving! So I decided to get something real quick. This carls jr was the first fast food I spotted. And my experience in this particular carls jr drive thru was theee worst service I have experienced in my life! First of all the woman at the drive thru took at least 3minutes to even respond and she got my order wrong twice! I actually had to pull up to the srive thru wondow because she could not get my order correct. Finally she gives me total with a rude tone and slams the window in my face while Im asking very politely if she can repeat my order. And to believe it or not that was only strike one for me! so finally she gets back to the window 5 min later and I am not stretching the truth at all when I say she took 5 min literally snatches the money from my hand strike 2 and again slams the window in my face! Ugh! I was really getting to my very last nerve at this point. So she takes awhile to come back my food and of course she gets my order wrong. strike 3 she over charged me! And surprisingly I kept my cool. So I drive away and get get home and she totally skimped me on my fries! I dont know if this lady was out to get me or if someone is trying to test my patience! who knows! Maybe she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on me? But this is THE LAST TIME im ever eating carls jr EVERRR!,1

"Just terrible service, rude and unprofessional. Pedi polish was done well but massage, sugar scrub and hot stone massage were done rushed and with an attitude like I was bothering her by being there for service. Mani was a nightmare. The gel on both thumb nails crinkled up and looked wrinkly and bumpy. She tried to ""cover up "" the error 8x and then refused to do them over again when they still looked awful. She and the owner kept telling me how pretty they looked, and refused to admit that the nails looked obviously horrible. Some other nails didn't get the polish evenly applied, and they wouldn't even talk about that either. They were pointing at me and talking laughing. It was so frustrating. I will not only never go back there, I will be telling everyone I know to stay away. This place was a very pricey bad nail experience for me.",1
"I'm glad I had to wait until I got home to approve my review because it gave me time to stew in the upset stomach I was dealing with the rest of work.

I checked the health inspector reports and apparently it's doing fine though.",1

"Serious Trust Issues. Otherwise pleasant but trust is required in all hotels . n nI stay here a few times a year whenever business takes me to Phoenix. nIt has been a great hotel, but there is one MAJOR issue i have with this hotel. n nUnauthorized charges specifically, room service adding additional tip onto the bill. nIn all hotels, I personally do not add more tip onto room service bills unless service is super exceptional, since there's an automatic 22 gratuity charge. After I checked out, I noticed that one of the nights, the charges were higher than I had on receipt. I called to check in, and the front desk said that I had written in 6 ADDITIONAL tip for the room service. I know for a fact that i did not and it seems as if the server herself added it on herself. n nThere's something VERY wrong with this. I'm not mad over 6, but I am furious that someone tried to get away with stealing money in increments. I always heard about people trying to get away with this but I've never had this happen to me until my trip here. I cannot believe that out of all places, this happens at the Ritz Carlton. n nA hotel is based on trust. People have access to your rooms. When you have staff that cannot be trusted, there are some serious issues going on at this hotel. nFront desk took care of this but no word from mgmt or even acknowledgement that this happened.",1

"My son and I had tickets to see Michael Jackson One at Mandalay Bay, we made reservations to have dinner Lupo. We were seated right away and the staff was so kind pleasant. Thanks to reading yelp reviews before I went, I knew about the salads and that they happily split the dinners if sharing before bringing out to the table. Since we were going to the show we split dinner, the caprese salad was perfectly fresh and delicious, the raviolis with sausage on the side was incredibly delicious the seasonings were perfecto! We got a nice bottle of merlot and the dinner atmosphere was fabulous! Our waiter was so informative and knowledgeable so we listened to all that he had to say about each dish!

"I have to be honest, I really do not like this place. n nAt all. n nI've been coming here for years . . I practically used to live here back when I was dumb enough to date boys who are in bands. I never remember liking it then, and after last nights show, my mind hasn't changed much. n nIts small. Its dirty. Its unorganized. I find it really weird that its located in a strip mall next to a burrito shop. On a sold out night, its next to impossible to get a drink at the over sized bar that takes up 70 of the venue. Order 2 at a time. double fisting is the only way to booze at The Clubhouse. They offer food. that is prepared at the restaurant next door and brought over. which is also weird, but the nachos looked totally decent. The bathroom situation is terrible. With only one stall, I waited in line for over 20 minutes. I know we women like to take our time, but come on bitches! Hurry up and pee! n nThe parking lot is a zoo, and there are never any spots. Park in the business complex right next door instead. just don't let you little sister sneak out of a show early to sleep in the car because you will return with it surrounded by cops. n nI know I've said absolutely nothing positive I realize that I am a Yelp snob and I notice every single detail at any place I am at. Especially the bad ones. But seriously, I really do not have anything good to say. Unfortunately this is just where my favorite bands decide to book so I'm forced to just deal with it.",1
"This is a medium sized all you can eat sushi and Asian food buffet. We went during ""Happy Hour "" where the price is only 11.95 per adult. Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out. n nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation. The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience. I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here. There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables. These were not bad, but not worth recommending. The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of. The rest of the desserts are forgettable. n nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there. It's been years since I had to worry about this food additive. Although my headache was not bad, I don't need this experience again. Go only if MSG doesn't bother you.",1
"Good times at the Goodwich! Simple concept here. Just three dudes making 'wiches out of a shack. 'Nuff said. n nMy order nReuben. Well done! The perfect amount of all ingredients and a crunchy marble rye is always appreciated. Only problems being the meat was a bit fatty and the bread is just soaaaked with butter grease. Wipe your hands after every bite type grease. No bueno. n nFalafel. another good, not great 'wich. I liked the patty style delivery of the falafel and the light cucumber and kale slaw were excellent accompaniments. Again, this was extremely greasy. n nThe grease paired with a 17min wait for a pair of sammies drops the ol' 'wich to 4 stars in my book. Still delicious and still worth a visit though.

"My first time at one of Mario Batali's restaurant. We had the Truffle Tasting menu.which was delicious overall except for the salty egg pasta. At least they send it back to the kitchen and gave us a new plate, but it was still a bit too salty in my standards. The chocolate dessert was super strong, which made me assume there was alcohol in there. The server assured me there wasn't any alcohol in the chocolate, but I was high for the evening. I would like to go back to try their regular menu or even the pasta tasting one day though.",2
"While not unforgivably unpleasant, my visit to Fire Station was still pretty dysfunctional. As an example, when my friend picked up our table's parmesan bottle by the lid, the bottom half of the jar fell off and spilled cheese everywhere obviously the lid was not screwed on . Given its location on campus, I couldn't be sure whether this was the restaurant's fault i.e., sloppy server didn't screw on the top properly or if some jerk frat guy left it as a prank for the next customer. I wouldn't cut a restaurant's rating down for such a trivial thing, but things got more.weird.as dinner progressed. n nMy friends and I ordered a few glasses of wine to go along with our meal. When the drinks came out, it turned out that they only had 2 wine glasses, and the third drink had to be served in a tumbler. I looked around the restaurant only 2 other tables were occupied at this point, so I was left to wonder if they only had 2 wine glasses in the entire restaurant.? I know that campus bars are the least likely places for customers to order wine, but I'm not sure why it would be offered if the bar wasn't prepared to serve it. n nWe also ordered small side salads as an appetizer. The salad we received consisted of 1 2 a cup of shredded iceberg lettuce the type of lettuce you'd use to top a taco and 1 2 a cup of shredded cheese. I have never had a salad that was so disproportionate in its lettuce to cheese ratio shouldn't the salad be mostly vegetables? . To add insult to injury, the salad cost around 3, which is cheap for most places, but a bit extreme for what we received. Unfortunately, I think the 1 side salads at McDonald's are superior in terms of quality. n nFinally, our entrees arrived. My friends ordered a gluten free pizza to share and I had the calzone. After the first few problems, I was a bit wary of the food, but luckily my calzone turned out to be delicious. Nicely browned with a cheesy crust on the outside and filled with lots of goodies inside. Also, it was extremely generous for the price around 6, I think . My friends liked their gluten free pizza. However, when they tried to order pizzas in other sizes besides medium and asked if other items like the calzone could be made with the gluten free dough, they were told no. Obviously, the crust was probably some frozen, pre ordered thing and not made fresh in house n nHonestly, I have a hard time seeing this place succeed given the competitiveness of food places around campus. I'm sure that their primary customer base undergrads probably don't care about things like weird missing wine glasses and cheese salads, but this place tries to present itself as a little classier than the usual booze hangout for underage kids. Unfortunately, it even fails to rise to the level of many of the booze hangouts.",1
"My initial reaction was positive when I walked in and saw the nice produce. After that, everything went downhill. I needed to get some flavored coffee. The area was littered with spilled coffee beans from people and the shelf below the holding tubes had four or five bags with different amounts of beans that were just left there. n nWhen I went to add beans to the hopper of the grinder, it was 3 4 full with beans someone had just dumped in there and left. The top of the grinder where the beans go was filthy with grounds from previously ground beans and loose beans. The whole area was disgusting. n nI didn't buy any coffee here. Instead, I went to the checkout and left. When I got home, I looked for one item I knew I had picked up. It was then I realized she hadn't bagged it and it was still at the store I guess. That's my mistake for not checking. n nI won't be stopping at this location again. It's awful!",1
This is the best dental office I've ever been to. The level of detail and explanation that they give you is excellent. They show you photos and X rays over time on monitors and really take the time to explain every detail of your dental health. They are friendly and have the best technology available. I couldn't recommend them more highly.,2
"I should have followed my intuition and stayed the hell away from this place! Worst car rental place I have ever experienced. The customer service at the rental desk was great, however when you have a problem and call the 1 800 number you are shit out of luck. I had problems with the battery dying on my trip to Zion National Park and I tried to call in, they assumed it was my fault and offered no help. I used MY insurance to call for a battery jump, the car started and was fine, next day same problem, battey dead. Had to get a new battery for the car so I could make it back to Vegas. Once there the Manager tired to resolve the issue and take money off of my bill but I had to catch my flight home. I called once home and that's where the real fun began. The ""customer service "" person was very rude and condesending She acted as if the whole thing was my fault and offered no apology, nor did she offer any understanding on how I was left stranded in a national park with a car that would not start.She offered me vouchers.LOL, like I am ever going to rent a car from them again.too funny. This employee refused to let me speak to anyone else there and claimed to have ""authority "", umm no, you suck at your job actually! I am currently waiting for a call back from the ""Manager "", we'll see what happens.ONe thing for certain is that this rental place sucks and no I would not recommend it, spend the extra money and go to Enterprise. nUpdate Spoke to the ""Supervisor "" was extremely uninterested in anything I told him and could care less about my trouble with the car, worst customer service EVER! basically called me a liar and said things did not really happen like they said, even though I was THERE, I think I would know. Total scumbag, rip off lying dirt bag company, if you rent from them beware, cuz they don't give two shits about their customers, the cars or anything else but making money off phoney gas charges and other bullshit. FUCK DOLLAR RENT A PIECE OF SHIT!",1
"Got married on Valentines Day and booked an 8 30 dinner at the Eiffel Tower. It was a major disaster. Would never go back even if it were free. They don't care about anything except making a dollar. I paid 450 for a lousy meal for two that was 90 minutes late in seating. They should lose their license for breaking the fire code and allowing too many people into their facility to wait at the bar or in line for well over an hour past the reservation time. I say if you were there and younger than 30, tell everyone it's an old school place to avoid!",1
"Go hungry! This place is about huge breakfast portions. As far as quality, it's hit or miss. So, you might want to give it a few tries",2
"A friend of my husband's gave him a gift card to this place and told him they had great food. We decided to give it a try. There were four in our party and we were lucky to get a table since it is a very, very small restaurant. Items ordered between the party of four Italian wedding soup, eggplant parm, pasta with bolognese sauce, house salad and pizza with sausage, onion and basil. The pizza barely had any onions on it. Very little sauce and cheese. I didn't try the eggplant parm, pasta or italian wedding soup but other party members stated the food was average. One of the reasons I'm giving it only one star is due to very poor customer service The waiter could barely speak english then when we presented our gift card the owner came out an told us he would not accept the gift card. He stated the gift cards were purchased when someone else owned the restaurant and he was not obligated to honor it. There was no way we would know this as the gift card we were given had the same restaurant logo as is currently in use. My husband's friend would have no way of knowing this restaurant was sold or when it was sold. This place is in a bad neighborhood too. I didn't feel too safe around there.",1
"This paper is awful and its internet version azcentral.com is even worse. I will glimpse through the web version solely for the purpose of reading local news and might pick up a physical copy for the crossword. It does, however, defy two stereotypes associated with a major newspaper. Firstly, it seemingly has a policy against ground breaking journalism and discourages its reporters from ""getting the scoop. "" Secondly, that whole ""liberal media "" characteristic does not apply to this paper at all. Every election it endorses campaigning politicians, though almost always backs the conservative. Letters to the editor are largely conservative and are little more than toned down hate speech. However, simply visit their website, which is available to the public with a thread format, and you will see the unbridled hate speech, borderline clinically insane comments faithful readers leave, that this media outlet does not monitor. n nPolitics aside, the paper is full of spelling and grammatical errors, lags behind other Valley print media sources in content and could stand a massive restructuring from within, as in the business and policy side of this organization needs to be completely gutted and rebuilt properly.",1
"Cheap prime rib special. Good for the price. When it's busy, it'll be a little wait. Other than that the food is good.",2
"Now that I'm awaiting to go to my first Coachella next year, I thought this would be a good taste of Music Festival Life. n nInitially tried to get 100 presale tickets when they first came out but, they sold out immediately. Like, 15 minutes past the start time immediate. nOnce the LIB weekend started and I heard saw many pics from the event, I figured I'd try to see what was available for Sunday the last day on Craigslist. nNeedless to say, I found steal of a deal from a group from LA who were selling tix for 40. n nI was worried about the parking so I left my car at Cosmo and had a friend drop me off to DTLV. We took the side roads and it was, surprisingly, easy going traffic. Cops and officials told me that the last day was probably slower because people had to travel back home. n nEveryone walking to the entrance of LIB made me feel like one with the festival goers. We walked into various murals on the walls of various parking lots, restaurants, buildings, and even motels in Downtown. Some of which were prolly abandoned before LIB. n nMet up with my boyfriend and his friends who are avid festival goers. The phone reception in Downtown was next to none so, we arranged a ""met up spot! "" Once I met them, I put my phone on airplane to save battery and just took pics and video all night. n nMissed Jonelle Monae and J5 but, was able to enjoy Zedd, Danny Brown, and Vegas' very own, The Killers. n nAlong with the music, the food had to be the best music festival food ever.according to the bf and his friends. Restaurants like Honey Salt, Blue Ribbon Sushi, and RM Seafood were there. It was quite ridic to have this amazing food.at a music fest.in downtown.Las Vegas. n nWeather was perfect. Sunny, cool, and breezy. PERFECTION! nThe vibe at LIB was fun, pleasurable, and just magical. nAmazing to see what's happening to DTLV thanks to Downtown Project nHappy to call Vegas ""home!

"If you put in a few wooden figurines from around the world you'd feel like your inside disney's small world ride. The patio seemed very nice but the inside with mall walkers gawking made the ambiance a bit kitschy, but overall a nice change from all of the steakhouses. Great menu with all of the standard slabs of beef and then some. Some in our group raved about the sea bass why they ordered sea bass in a steak house was beyond me . They have a unique wedge salad the hot and cold wedge that was unique and tasty. They also have this amazing potato bread that when topped with some of their chive butter tastes just like a baked potato. They certainly have a scenic wait staff but I think the sommelier just turned 21.",2
Rude! Rude! Rude! I came back here because I had a flat tire. I could not believe the poor service and how long it took. I have always bought my tires from this location and raved about them. Im not sure what happened this time. Maybe it was because they weren't selling me new tires. I won't be going back.,1
"Don't eat the fish! I had their grilled salmon. Fish was dried, burnt, and the mashed potatoes tasted like shit with gingerbread gravy. After about 10 minutes of trying to eat the salmon my stomach started hurting like someone had just pinched me. I told the manager about the issue and he had the gall and tell me that good poisoning takes at least 24 hours for the effects of food poisoning to kick in. And he still expected me to pay for the good that made me feel ill. I eventually had the charge removed however not happy. n nI will not return to this establishment.",1
"I have been wanting to see ""O "" FOREVER! My wish finally came true for my 30th birthday as a gift from the boyfriend. n nThe stage is ridiculous. The way it's constructed and the way it works are both mind boggling. n nThe entire show is gorgeous, and I even bought the soundtrack afterward. During some Cirque shows, there is a lack of action around the main performance. However, this is not the case here. There might actually be too much side action! I couldn't decide where to focus my eyes, and i was constantly scanning the stage for interesting characters and acrobatics theatrics. n nThe only downside is that we came to the later show after a VERY filling and wonderful meal at Le Cirque, and midshow we were both drowsy. I was having trouble staying awake, and the boyfriend was just about completely out. So.I think both of us missed a great deal of the performance, which is upsetting, but was unavoidable.",2
"Where to start, let's just saw Awful! Service was ok, waiter was pleasant. Ordered the angel hair with chicken, it showed up almost 10 minutes after every one else was served, and when it did, the pasta was almost RAW. How do you screw up angel pasta, well they did. Another in our party had the eggplant parm. They should call it no eggplant pram.barely any eggplant.overall, ever rated, over priced, and just not very good.",1
The pizza have a burned taste and cold. The garlic fries is worst . Won't see me again,1
"Pretty decent so far. nI think the monthly trainings are great and Andrea has really helped me. I think I've lost about 7 lbs in the last week and a half. Usually they will try to upsell me on training which I thought at first was a little annoying, but I just advise them that I cannot and leave it at that. It doesn't bother me anymore. After using a machine we are to wipe it down for the next person. The problem with that is half the time the paper towel dispensers are empty. n nOne thing I suggest to them is to rent buy the vacant suite next to it. The gym is growing and it probably would be a good thing to do. n nOverall I enjoy the gym and think the equipment is suitable.",2
"Wanted something different for lunch, went to Yelp and bam! Rhonda had just put in a review for a place 5 minutes away. It was fate! n nDilly's Deli was easy to fine, had lots of parking and a great mix of student and business customers. As if the bucket of Dr. Brown's Soda wasn't enough to make me like it, ""Looking for love in all the wrong places "" was playing. Followed by Van Halen's Animal. Interesting transition. n nMenu is simple, sandwiches, wraps, salads and soup, and combos available for any 2 of those things. I noticed they use Boars Head meat, which is nice. I got a 1 2 sandwich small soup which actually less than a full sandwich at 6.29. The sandwich was on a soft Italian style bread, cut at an angle. Made for a better sandwich than I thought as it was toasted just a bit, but oh so soft on the inside. The chicken salad was great. And the small soup they gave came in a bread bowl SO awesome. It wasn't sourdough as I'd hoped, but it was a nice white. That Wisconsin cheddar soup was way too yummy. It felt more like bread dip. And since I got mine to go, I got the whole loaf w soup on the side so I could create it myself once it was ready to be eaten. n nThe place is cute with nice outdoor and indoor seating. Definitely a new regular spot for lunch!",2
"Great place to start and end your night if you're staying at the NYNY. n nIf you're looking for a dive bar or a club scene, than this is NOT your place. However, if you're looking for a place that plays upbeat music, offers plenty of TVs, video poker and plenty of seating, than this is the spot to be. We had a group of 15 come to town and stay at the NYNY to celebrate a surprise 50th birthday and out of the neighboring properties Excalibur and Monte Carlo we constantly found ourselves coming back to this spot. n nFor three nights we started and ended here. With the location being in the center of the casino, it draws a wide variety of people and offers appeal to everyone. n nCONS The bartenders did not appear as though they were into their job at all and the drinks are pricey specialty cocktail 11.50 and a bottled beer 9 . If you plan to sit in one of the surrounding but comfortable couches, be prepared to purchase two drinks minimum per person. n nOther than that though everyone in our group said they enjoyed the bar and we will definitely be going back!",2
"Now first off i'd like to say that I've only eaten here once, and if when the day comes that I go back and decide what I wrote is wrong then I will change it. nBut, anyways. nThe look and decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy, the employees there were nice. Menu was really small. nI tried the fried dumplings, they were average. And I also had the ramen, only because that was the only option as a main dish, and I was not pleased at all, it was the second worst ramen i've ever had! nBenefit of the doubt. . Maybe it's just not for me, I see alot of good reviews for this place. But then again, this is the point of reviews! n nHappy eating!",1
Great Value. We always have leftovers! This place is delicious! Always friendly! nAlways order the biscuits n gravy. The hot link and corn beef hash are delicious!,2
"The Steak house at Circus Circus was closed and we wanted to know of a place we could still get a good steak at 11 p.m. The maitre d' recommended we try Peppermill. The restaurant was crowded but there wasn't a wait to get a table. Ordering drinks took forever because the waitress had to get a separate ""cocktail waitress "" to take our alcoholic drink order. One of our friends joked she wouldn't order a steak based on what she saw walking to our table. The price for a steak dinner ranged from 26 to 29. I commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. Boy was I wrong. I order a New York steak and shrimp dinner for 29. The steak was the size you would get for a 9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. To say this was over priced is an understatement. I know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. The other dinners chicken nachos and a fresh fruit platter were no better. If that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type. Needless to say no one finished their food or drinks. What a waste of money. As for the maitre d' I wonder if he gets some sort of kick back for sending people to this place. So much for asking a local where to eat.",1
"I was always a fan of the HNJ chain in California, but tonight was just not their night to be representing their chain. n nTonight was my brother's 24th birthday and I already called in advance that a group was coming in to dine in. Our waiter, who I will hold the name from this review, took our orders, served us water, and left his shift giving it to another young man who took over the table. Granted, I knew it was about 70 mins from Last Call and we were a big group, you would assume attention to detail is most important. n nFirst we order appetizers, which were mediocre at best the calamari breading was too salty and saturated from the deep fryer oil . Next, the orders of clams came out and within the first two clams I ate, I felt like I almost split my teeth because I bite gritty sediment in my food. Seafood should've been washed properly and rid of the rocks and grits of the clam. I had to send it back. By now, my appetite has faded because of the quality of the food I expected from such a reputable chain. As everyone one around me got their food, multiple bus boys girls brought food out to the table. Unknowingly more people came to join our party, the late comers who ordered food after my brother and I received their food first. Granted, most of us ordered similar dishes, it should have been the staff's responsibility to figure out who's food went to who. I ended up not getting my 2lbs of shrimp with potatoes and corn, sending back a pound of clams, and not even enjoying my appetizer. n nWhen the checks came back, none of the orders were organized in the way we set it with the first waiter to left serving us. I almost feel bad, which is why I'm donating a half star to the review, for the new waiter because he got bombarded with complaints from our table. Beers from one side of the table were charged to the other side of the table's tab, and one of my friends ended up paying 95 when he barely at half a bag of shrimp. It is just ridiculous, and what made it worse is that it was closing time, so pressure to get up and leave was felt. I've worked in the restaurant business and I know how staff get when the last few customers don't leave. n nThe only reason why I'm donating another half star to give this review of Tempe's Hot Juicy a whopping 1 star review, is because he gave us a free pound of shrimp 'on the house' from the kitchen. I honestly don't know what is wrong with this chain but from what I remember at my experience in Cali's HNJ, it was a night and day. I'm leaving this review still upset and disappointed at the professionalism of the staff and food quality tonight.",1
"I really liked this place when I first started going here, but just like every other nail place, as soon as they get busy their quality goes down. I probably would have been a little more generous on my review had they not totally screwed me over. I was getting married in November and wanted to bring my bridal shower here. I felt so special because they offered to open up on Monday just for us. Everyone was coming in from out of town and I had raved about this place so I was excited for them to experience it. Little did I know my whole day was about to be crushed. We showed up at the allotted time, no one is there. We wait a little longer, still no one shows up. I tried to call thinking maybe someone is in there getting set up. I left a voicemail explaining the situtation. We had to call around last minute and try to find someone to take all of us. Luckily for me, my wedding nails turned out beautifully. I'm very disappointed in this place. I never got a call back, never got an apology, and I will not be back.",1
Yum! They have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options. The staff are very helpful and the service is great. Loved their falafel and lentil soup. I'll definitely be back!,2
"Food is typical of bar environment fried wings and burgers. Not bad. Really like the mango habanero wings. nMy two star poor rating stems from being refused entry at the door b c a game was starting in 1 2 hour and my family myself, husband and two small kids were there only for dinner not the game. They told us we'd have to pay an entry fee to get in for the game. nit was 6 30 pm.we just wanted dinner and not to pay an entry fee to a place where we were spending money on food anyway!",1
Interesting! nOld school Chicago Italian decorated place. nThe service is a bit slow. nThe food is not good just looks good. nI guess this place went down.,2
"I had dinner here last night and the food and service was outstanding. I had the Delmonico steak with lobster mashed potatoes. Wonderful! It was my birthday, so we got a complimentary butter cake and ice cream. Outstanding! I wish I had the recipe. I would love to go back.",2
"If you're hungry. make sure you EAT BEFORE YOU GET THERE. The entrees are sold as , ""small plates for sharing "" however, how do you share 4 muscles and 6 clams for 16. The pitch is, 'the portions are smaller but the quality is higher "" which is suppose to explain the pricing sadly this didnt explain my dry and over cooked rib eye. n nWe ended up buying several plates and by the time you're full you've easily spend 200 for two people. There are better and more fulfilling options out there. n nWine selection is poor but you can smoke cigars on the patio. n nSide note Server was in training and did a good job.",1
"Marginal food, small portions, over priced. Service was awful. Pass",1
"Lots of parking available, covered uncovered. New sky train access easy from garage parking and buses roam lot to pick up those parking on street level. Sky train runs every three minutes and connects to terminal on second floor where gates are.",2
"A frat bar with the novelty of a midget that pours shots. You go in, get your shot from a little person, and leave. This place is only ideal for the quick stop, or once you're already too intoxicated to care.",1
"This restaurant microwaves all the dishes in plastic wrap which has been known to cause cancer. nI would stay away. nThe owners also do not like Americans, just Turkish people.",1
"Meh. n nI didn't walk into Teriyaki Boy with a lot of expectations for great cuisine. Here's what I wanted a nice, healthy, quick food option with Teriyaki flavor. But the restaurant somehow managed to dash those expectations. I'm just not enthusiastic about anything we ordered. n nThe crab Rangoon tasted like it had been thawed and served up i.e. all flavor was lost long ago while the food waited in a freezer . The eggs rolls were appropriately crisp, but tasteless. We drowned them in sweet and sour sauce in order to produce a taste. We finally found a little flavor in the Teriyaki chicken bowl and the Teriyaki flavor wasn't bad. But the dish came with boatload of rice with a meager serving of vegetables and chicken. Sigh. When you find a dish with a little flavor in this place, they skimp on the flavor and cover it in unseasoned rice. n nBasically, I walked in hoping for the McDonald's of Teriyaki cuisine. Problem is, McDonald's actually works hard to make sure it's food is flavorful use a whole lot of chemicals to keep the flavoring even after the food is frozen. So, skip Teriyaki Boy. It's a step under McDonald's.",1
"I wasn't expecting a five star dining experience, but this place is disgusting. The food may even be worse than Jack in the Box and you're better off eating the food at the bottom of your freezer from years ago! My dad even told me that when he used to work there, there was a grease bubble that popped in the kitchen onto the wall and the peeled it off and put it into the fryer. Never going back. EVER.",1
"Hadn't been in years, decided to come based on nostalgia and I was so indecisive on exactly what I had a taste for but I was starving, and my go to Basil wasn't open, so why not try the place that has everything right? Wrong. Bad decision. n nMost of the food was greasy and just not well prepared. The medium ""steak "" was tough and dry. The fried chicken was just ok. I did try out the salad bar and I was pleased, but you don't come to a buffet and pay 12 bucks for a salad. n nThe desserts were all terrible and clearly made with cheap ingredients. The chocolate fountain was weak as you could tell they tried to thin it out by cutting it with oil or something. The frozen yogurt was tasteless. Oh, but those fresh hot rolls were great! Good thing I can get great, fresh, hot rolls at other places because I will not be coming back.",1
"I was feeling like a child, so I had the coconut cream pie French toast, and it was fantastic. She had the seafood omelet with avocado. It was good, but the avocado was definitely not ripe. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, but the water tasted like it was ladled from a public pool. Overall, a pleasant experience. We will definitely be back.",2
Had to update my review. Second trip here was awful. Tina did not even ask us what we wanted. We did the combo plate that is normally 20 and it was cold and bad. n nService girl was very weird and made us uncomfortable by standing over us watching us eat.,1
"There is nothing wrong with this place. But there is nothing extraordinary either. To be quite honest, I dined there with my mom, because we had a 20 coupon. Why not? n nThe service was great we had a couple of waiters, and for having to work during the holidays I went during Christmas time , they were upbeat and knowledgeable. n nThe food, on the other hand, was nothing amazing. I got a side of roasted vegetables drizzled with Balsamic Vinegar, and it was fine. I also had a special ravioli of the day, which had an interesting flavor, but the texture was a bit on the chewier side. It did taste nice, but I was not overly impressed. n nOverall, nothing was too spectacular about this place, but it tasted fine. It is a little on the pricier side for the quality of food you get, but we had a coupon, so I wasn't too bummed about that!",1
"Not sure what's with the other negative reviews. This was my first venture into the prime rib arena, so perhaps I have nothing to compare and it seems there are several prime rib restaurants in Las Vegas to try out. n nI think I ordered the The Cowboy Cut but in Cajun spices and it was very delicious and the portion was hefty perhaps even too large ! . n nI happened to be in the restaurant simply because the hotel I was staying in for my business trip was somewhat nearby. But now that I know of it's existence I will gladly make a trip to eat here.",2
"We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple ""Sorry for the wait "" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not. The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout. I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened. Looked like paprika for color, but that was it. Mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. We skipped dessert for obvious reasons. I am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. I hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that I could have done better myself. n nDo yourself a favor and avoid the Original Fish Market. I was generous to give one star.",1
"Do yourself a favor by saying you have shellfish allergy. n nWe really wanted to love this place and be blown away. I was excited to see so many positive reviews and thought we would also enjoy the experience. I hope my review will serve s a cautionary tale to the real sushi lovers.

I don't remember in which order. the shabu was decent but redundant because of the choice of protein, the fried prawn was not crispy and actually soggy and over seasoned. n nat this pointed i told the server we no longer want shellfish. she said that the last course typically doesnt have shellfish, and went back to her corner to chat with the other server. as if my dissatisfaction of the meal wasn't worth alerting the chef about. nMaybe we should've sat at the sushi bar. n n6. we had 5 pc of nigiri, of which 3 were good. and had silver something shrimp. which were some tiny slimy baby shrimps smaller than krill which I couldn't stomach to eat , and halibut.

"AVOID! Unless, of course, you want a whole bunch of your possessions ruined by water that leaks through the roof and down the back wall of your unit. Unless, of course, you don't mind dealing with employees who truly don't give a shit about you and your ruined possessions. Sure, we took out the insurance. But have we actually gotten to speak to someone yet about our ruined property a week later? No. We stopped by today to get our lock and close the rental agreement. No one was there.

"What can I say.What a dump! n nI stopped in here for a quick lunch because it was convenient for a business stop I had to make, what a mistake. I started by quickly using the restroom which was down two dingy stairwells with no banister. Once I reached the bottom I was treated to the stench of fresh cigarette smoke, clearly the help couldn't act like humans and go outside. The bathroom was a disgrace, that's all I'll say about it but make sure you bring your anti bacterial hand sanitizer. n nThis should have been enough to walk out the door but I have a soft spot for diners and also it was 1PM, one hour after my daily feeding time. I bellied up to the counter and ordered a 1 2 Philly cheesesteak and onion rings because I am still 7 months French fry free ! n nThe food was pretty ordinary and the diet coke was either being watered down purposely or the fountain was broken, either way it was gross. I finished my meal and tried to pay with AMEX, I was informed they did not take AMEX. I thought to myself.'I wonder if they have ever considered putting a sign on the door that says, oh I don't know, we don't take AMEX'? I paid and ran out of there with what little of my dignity I had left. I'll be visiting this place again sometime in Nevuary.",1

Finally we get their bar menu to peruse it wasn't available on the internet because we checked after we specifically ask for it about 5 minutes later. n nWe did notice that there was only one waiter at the time running between rooms and they were understaffed.

It's an insult to call the swill they serve here tonkotsu ramen it completely lacked the full bodied flavour of pork. The noodles were overdone, the preserved bamboo had an unpleasant rank aroma. It was terrible all the way through. The addition of the anemic bland pork belly did the dish no favors. n nThe cod slider fared better but was still very unsatisfying. The fried cod lack crispness while it was definitely overwhelmed by the mayonaise y tartar sauce. When they listed this as being bar ""bites "", they weren't kidding the sammy was small. Quite frankly, a filet o fish would had been preferable and easier on the wallet. n nFinally, the pulled beef fries. The pulled beef short rib was one note while the wasabi cream. didn't taste at all like wasabi. The gravy was also overly watery which made the so so fries get soggy too quickly. n nGiven how this place performed during their happy hour, I would not consider trying Social House again. This place is barely edible and expensive to boot. Given the plethora of other great places to try on the Strip, this is definitely a pass. 2 stars.",1
Being Irish is very much a part of who I am. I take it everywhere with me. I have a fondness for Guinness and Murphy's. So far this is the only Irish Pub in Surprise. They do a few amusing variations on the classic Black and Tan that are worth a try. The tried and true fish fry brings in the faithful but the corned beef is my favorite bia. A great mint lamb dish was dropped from the menu. If enough requests come in they may bring it back thats a hint paddys High pub style seats and lack of lower altitude chairs are a complaint that I've heard from my mother In law.,2
"Went here along with the other Monica for the Yelp International Supper Club and had a great time. I love Cuban food but I must say I have never been so well educated in it as I was on Thursday night due to some experienced dining companions and the helpful server we had waiting on us. We also got a large sampling of appetizers to try so that was a lot of fun. n nMost of the apps were too much fried starch for me but the empanadas are something I would definitely order again. I also really liked the tamal even though the Cuban version is totally different from the Mexican ones I am used to. I ordered the Ropa Vieja for my entree since that is a classic Cuban dish. This one did not disappoint. There was so much flavor! It came with a lot of rice and there was way too much food on the plate for me to finish but I think without the apps and bread it would have been a good portion size. The sweet plantains were cooked perfectly and very tasty as well. Too much food to order dessert but I look forward to giving the flan a try next time. Also, I skipped on the alcohol on this evening in trying to keep the calories down but after reading the other reviews I will definitely be trying the mojitos next time! n nAnother successful supper club event. Other than Jamie stealing my food 0 . I am looking forward to Ethiopian next month!",2
"Since this is Montreal, I didn't have high expectations for Korean bbq, but I wanted to give this place a try cus my friends here were so curious about it. The marinade was definitely not Korean.more like Chinese diluted to adhere to the typical sweetness of western food. It tasted cheap. I advise people to get drunk so you can forget about the bland taste and just keep eating. As I looked around, I felt bad for the people who are eating this, thinking this is actually Korean. I gave it one more star only because the price is relatively cheap but remember that you get what you pay for.",1
So I called this number to see if someone behind the desk would answer. This number goes no where but to some employee hotline for the post office. It was 3min till 3pm and of course they close at 3 on sat. So thinking maybe a person would answer and she a little kindness to stay open for 5mim. But nope! Only ppl there give a shit about their own self interest and not be just a lil kind. Fuckers karma a bitch.,1
"Group fun at Cantina. OH YEA. we got the fish bowl room! Just be careful you don't run into the awkwardly placed glass partition. Dinner was wicked good! I had the veggie something or nother. Tasted fried, so I'm good! Everyone at the table 8 or us was pleased with everything that they ordered. The waitress was very attentive even though our group seemed to have overwhelmed her a wee bit! I do like this place a good bit, so if you're looking for a great lil mexican restaurant then definitely check it out. I've never heard of anyone having a bad experience there! Check out the Dragonberry cocktail! It's spectacular! Make reservations, they book up quick!",2
"Revisited the Monte Carlo for three days. I remembered my first visit to the Monte Carlo 5 years prior as being a very nice comfortable hotel that lacked that Vegas umph. This time around I had to take off a star. n nFirst off it took us maybe 40 minutes to check in. Lines were long and they were understaffed. Once checked in we were shocked to see how run down the room was. It was dirty. Dirty towels, dirty tub, and dirty floors. We asked for a new room and right away they sent a bellman to take our bags to our new room. Between waiting in line and changing rooms it took us almost two hours to settle in. n nThe room was clean but run down. No glasses to go with the ice buckets which is no big deal as I just called room service to have them delivered but the lack of attention to detail showed me that the Monte Carlo had gone down quality wise. n nEvery morning we woke up to dance music at 9am that was being played poolside. Nothing wrong with music by why is a DJ blaring music at 9am? We never were able to sleep in. Last thing I want to do is party late into the night to be woken up at 9am. n nThe only good thing was the price. Priceline offered a 110 dollar a night special that included a free buffet for the both of us every day. n nI would never stay here again. I don't need a posh room but cleanliness and peace and tranquility in your room is a must.",1
"So excited to hear that this Michael's is soon to be renovated! n nThis place is pretty much a clutter of old, out of date supplies that are usually not in the right place and nearly destroyed. I find it incredibly difficult to find anything here, and if I do, it usually has something wrong with it. n nI love Michael's as a concept, and I grew up coming to this place with my mother so we could do various arts and crafts for fun. Hell, I still come as a grown up so I can do arts and crafts for fun! n nI am looking forward to reviewing this Michael's once the remodel is finished, as I am sure it will turn out to be a much better store! Good luck with the reno!",1
"I visit Las Vegas on business for a nonprofit and have stayed here 3 times to keep our costs down. I paid 26 earlier this week. However, had I checked I could have paid 30 at Stratosphere a few blocks away for better room and ambiance. Similar rates were available in nearby downtown Fremont Hotel, etc . n nAs a result I think I will pay a few dollars more for a better experience next time. Room was small. It was pretty clean although some dirt in bath was missed. Toilet ran intermittently all night. Linens and towels are clean but very worn. No hair dryer or clock in the room, altho they will loan you these if they have them. TV worked OK. n nNeighborhood is the biggest drawback. There are some empty stores and defunct wedding chapels, plus occasional homeless people and addicts on the sidewalk. n nThese folks are trying, and for some of the lowest rates in Nevada you can't expect too much. I just think the experience is marginal enough that I will look for something more reliable next time.",1
"Always liked Fatburger, the traffic at this location seemed slow, but the service was still exceptional.",2
"This place gets my vote for the worst KBBQ experience ever. The meats were awful and poor quality. Also worth mentioning is their horrible banchan. It was not fresh nor did it taste good. I usually ask for seconds or thirds when it comes to banchan too. It made me really miss the L.A. KBBQ joints. The soon tofu was extremely, uncomfortable spicy! It gave me really bad heartburn. I can handle spicy food too.",1
"I am been craving greasy food! I seriously I. Love with this place.why, you ask because the onion rings are amazing, they are perfect!",2
For breakfast on saturday morning i stopped by Lappert's all the way from hawaii for some coffee and malasadas. Granted they weren't as good as leonards it was still tasty in the morning as they were a bit too doughy and heavy. n nNever got the chance to try the ice cream though.,2
"Every time I come here, hoping, just hoping that I'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. Raw. Unfiltered. Old school. Like a ballpark from the 1920's or something. n nBut each time I come away disappointed, even more than last time. n nMy father worked here three or four decades ago. I'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends. n nThe service is anywhere from good to great, and they are fast and friendly! n nAnd maybe, just maybe, I come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. At odd hours. or an hour after the rush. n nEvery time, the hotdogs and brats are harder than a rock. Not a snappy casing, no, this is like barely edible hard exterior. n nSo what's a man to do? Try again? Sadly, I'll probably forget about my recent experiences, and try them again. n nI just hope they are fresher next time, because I can't imagine them worse than today.",1
"I took my dad and family here for Father's Day and even though it was a holiday, we only had a 30 minute wait and the service and food was excellent. My dad and I sat in the bar area while we waited to be seated and had a martini and a gin and tonic, both of which were made strong and poured at our table. n nMy parents said it was one of the best steaks they had ever had and they were very happy that it was cooked exactly to order. My mom said she couldn't remember the last time she had had a steak that was actually medium well. I had the Alaskan King crab and it was also cooked well and served with butter sauce that was warmed at your table by a candle. n nThe service was excellent and every waiter there was aware of our table and needs even though they weren't our waiters. Best team work between hostesses, waiters, and management I have ever seen.",2
"If you're a fan of Michael Jackson, you'll enjoy the show. They preformed a wide variety of his music with some nice visualizes. n nIf you're like me and a fan of Cirque du Soleil, skip this one. This show was seriously lacking in the acrobatic, strength, and balance displaces that are associated with that name. It is almost completely a song and dance show.",1
"I am torn between giving this place 3.5 stars and 4, but since I cannot give half a star, I'll go ahead and give it 4. The design of the hotel and the rooms is really nice, modern and we really loved the smoke free atmosphere. Plus you don't have to deal with any crowds. If you want eateries and casinos, they are a few steps away at the Aria and the Bellagio, etc. n nThe beds are comfortable, but having the bathroom door right by the bed was not my favorite, particularly because the door did not close all the way. They do, however, provide plenty of towels and Aveda soaps, lotions, and hair products. n nArriving at the hotel can be confusing, mainly because the Vdara does not have its own dedicated parking lot. Valet parking is complementary, but the wait time, from what we heard, could be about 30 minutes if you needed your car back. We walk everywhere when we're in LV, so that was not a problem. We also checked out early, so we got our car pretty quickly. No complaints about the valet staff at all they were all very nice. Check in was fairly quick and the staff was friendly. n nOur main complaint is that housekeeping never came to our room to clean it. We left fairly early on our second day and turned on the housekeeping light, but came back to a room that looked exactly the same way we left it. Thank goodness for the extra towels, right? n nFor a fairly pricey resort, I find this unacceptable. I am not surprised when this happens at places like the Circus Circus, but here I was not the least bit amused. Also, we would not recommend trying to call any of the hotel desks because you will be hard pressed to get someone to answer your questions.or at all. n nPersonally, I would rather stay at the Aria, which was awesome from beginning to end, or any of the other wonderful resorts out there.",2
"These people make me sick. They hold my direct deposit payroll checks for up to 14 days! I set up my bills to auto deduct when my check will be deposited. Said I wanted NO overdraft protection. They hold my check, bills get paid and bam I'm hit with 300 in overdraft fees? Are you serious? My money disappears, has not shown in my account for days, shows balance when I know I have money, go down to talk to them and they said, looks good on our side you must have read it wrong. I know how to read a statement you ignoramous. Way to make your customers uncomfortable, awkward and angry. Everyone in there is rude, looks down on you and so incredibly unhelpful. I heard great things about them, and never in my life have I had a worse experience. I have banked with Chase, Wells Fargo, TruWest, BOA and desert schools. Never again would I put anyone in their hands. Unless you don't want access to your money, people to look at you like you are garbage, not respond to phone calls or e mails, and hold your check so they can charge you insane amount in overdraft fees because they won't release your own money to you.",1
"This was a great exhibit! Very well done and put together. You go through each phase of the ship from the dream of building it, to the end when it was excavated, and artifacts were brought up. It is a beautiful well done exhibit. n nThat being said it isn't getting five stars because of my gift shop experience. I was in line to look at my picture the ones they take before you go through the exhibit, and we were next in line. The person behind the counter ignored us and helped the other couple next to us. It was EXTREMELY obvious that we were next. Since we had a baby that had been great while we were in the exhibit, beginning to become fussy, we had to leave. When I called to complain they were ""sorry "" but the person who helped us didn't offer us any sort of discount on the picture to try to smooth things over. I have worked in retail before and would have done my best to make it up to the customer. I hope they see this and realize there mistake. As a result the overall experience wasn't as great as it should have been. Be warned about the staff in the gift shop.",2
"Went here with my cousin for happy hour and he told me that he didn't like this place because they charged him 4 for tip automatically when he previously went here. I had gone here before but my other cousin paid for the bill so i didn't know if they really did charge that or not. We decided to give it a try. Food was ok, nothing special. service was good though. When we paid for the bill, we had it split 25 each. I saw on the receipt that my card was charged 25. I left a tip of 6 in cash I put 0 on the receipt for the whole bill. When I got home my cousin told me to check my account because they had charged him 30 and not the 25 we had on our receipts. I checked my account and it was the same for me, I got charged 30. So all in all, we ended up leaving a tip of 16 for a 50 meal. I called and asked, they said they'd take care of it, BUT nothing happened. I don't ever plan on coming here again. Nor will i recommend it to anyone either. If I could put a negative star I would.",1
"This is my 3rd time to Naka sushi and I found the service to be consistent along with the food, so I felt compelled to write a review. We arrived to Naka for the dinner service that starts at 4 30, and we were greeted by the waitress and sat at a booth. Told her my selections and they arrived quickly. The appetizers are ok, the ahi poki, and mussels weren't to my standards from my experiences at other establishments but the fish is very fresh, the service was timely and I never saw the bottom of my cup. They were always around. Very good sushi imo for the location. I will be going back again.",2
"Let's get right into it, I love this place! Staff are very friendly, the place looks alway neat and also always packed. It's the new era of HoMa and HocheCaf u00e9 is ready for it. Casual ambiance, you've got your typical student, hipsters, businessman, writers and iPad enthusiast all waiting in line for a great cup of coffee. Depending on who's controlling the fancy machine you'll get a leaf or an elephant draw in the milk of your latte. Tastier than any Starbucks I've ever been to! Great variety of food from side dish to full meal. They even sell their own brand of coffee but it's never has good has the original. Its my go to coffee house on my week end days. Haven't tried they full meal yet, but the pastries are delicious. I'll keep coming here for a while and you should swig by for a cup!",2
"Went there today to get a refill on my regular tea, but they didn't have it in stock. I asked the clerk to call the Fashion Mall location and after saying she would be glad to, went about helping customers for at least 5 minutes. I finally made the trip. Of note the Clark county health dept gives them a B rating! My rating is less!",1
"The 4 star is really as high as it is based on the really low prices. yes the prices used to be even lower, but 5 bucks for a pizza that will cost you 10 bucks at say dominoes or some other pizzeria, and arguably tastes better? Yea, that is pretty damn good. Now this is far from the best pizza in Las Vegas, but if you arent looking to upgrade to one of the finer pizzas in Vegas like Grimaldi's, then this is the best of the low end. Great sporters of UNLV, and open 24 7? That is pretty solid. Hope these guys can keep the place open, its far from the first place to open in the same place, though in the past they havent lasted all that long.",2

"having taken my share of cabs as an adult, i've happily settled on union as a first choice. n ni've always hopped into a well kept, clean, stink free cab when ordering union. every driver i've had in the past four years has been courteous, friendly, and can tell if they should or shouldn't engage in conversation i can't say the same for the other, long running companies in madison. n ni am at least acquaintances with more than a dozen drivers, and have heard plenty of stories anonymous to the passenger, of course of them going out of their way to help someone to their door, carry groceries, and get blacked out people home safely that last one speaks volumes. n nin general, when you put your transportation needs in the hands of someone else, you're giving up a privilege, which other reviewers appear to have taken for granted. you put your wallet, time, and safety in the hands of someone else for the convenience of getting to or from somewhere without needing to rely on your own car.",2
"Surprise, surprise.I think I may like pierogies. I wouldn't call myself a pierogi connoisseur and honestly I've never really enjoyed the pierogies I've had. I always thought, ""What all the fuss about some dough stuffed with a bit of potato or whatever they are stuffed with?!?! "" Well now I know! n nWent to BBT with a fellow Yelper and we got a sampling of the pierogies the potato and cheese and the sauerkraut, we opted not to get the cottage cheese . I was expecting to have a similar experience of all the other times I've had a pierogi, but to my pleasant surprise this was quite different. n nThe potato and cheese pierogies are really stuffed with potato and cheese so it's not like your tasting alot of dough with some potato flavor. The sauerkraut wasn't too krauty if that makes sense it was alot milder than I thought it was going to be, but this was fine by me. I like sauerkraut but I think the milder flavor suited the pierogi. n nThank you BBT for introducing me to pierogies I actually like!",2
Horrible service. Our waiter came to our table 2x once for our order and to give us our check. The busboy did more for the table than the waiter.,1
"I took my truck in to fix a rattle in the tailgate and a center console that was pushing apart. After the first time I got it back, the center console was still pushing apart and the rattle was reduced by about 50 . I took it in for the second time, and Mark the employee who dealt with my truck each time told me the rattle was coming from my hitch. I took off the hitch and coaxed him to take a ride with me. I showed him exactly what was wrong. Long story short, he called it the window no, not at all and it wasn't a ""rattle, "" it was a ""squeak.

"Three of us had a portion of one teppan table shared with another couple and a regular who had been working for the WSOP or something. n nFirst off, the food was amazing. Meats were all tender filet mignon melted in my mouth, but the NY steaks were pretty good too , very well seasoned, and the multitudes of sauce were all delicious. A little disappointed with their 'hot' sauce. It was good and probably my second favorite after the garlic one, but it couldn't pass for mild at an Asian restaurant. I ordered the plain ole steamed rice instead of friend rice like everyone else because most teppan places just give you some butter soy sauce rice with some veggies tossed in. I think the chef forgot and just made all the rice into fried rice, so he just gave me and my friend some, and I was pleasantly surprised. n nWe didn't get the main chef, so our show wasn't as impressive. He tried some tricks, but he occasionally slipped up. He generally made up for with the conversation we had, until he got going with the regular at the table and the conversation steered toward strip clubs and pot. The girlfriend wants to come back and get the full show from the master himself.",2

"Horrible service. We had a party of 9 and Brook was our waitress. We had to ask her to take our order after waiting 15 minutes and it took our food another 30 minutes. We came around 1 00pm and it was not busy. The table next to us was seated after us and got their food before us. Brook spilled water on me and did not apologize. Food was also dropped on me when they were clearing the table, once again without an apology. Brook never came to check on us after we ordered our food and we had to ask for our bill. n nGood food, horrible service. If you get Brook I recommend you ask for someone else or find somewhere else to eat.",1
"We went for Sunday Brunch, so this review only covers that, not the hotel.the hotel itself may be great, I can't say. However, brunch was decidedly disappointing. We were seated a few minutes after 1pm, their last seating, and all of the food on the buffet seemed like it had been sitting out for hours. The short rib pasta was dry, the brussels sprouts were mushy and waaay overcooked, and the bacon was swimming in grease. The fruit on the dessert table was picked over, with only had a little melon and a few blueberries left. We didn't see them freshening any of the food except the desserts the whole time we were there, and instead of putting out new fruit, they just took away the tray. The drinks were also disappointing.my Bloody Mary was room temperature and the coffee was lukewarm. The only highlights were the beef tenderloin or what was left of it, only a few small slices , the crab cakes, and the omelet station at least those were made fresh . n nThe building is beautiful inside and out, and all the staff were friendly, but if they're going to accept a 1pm reservation, they should be prepared to have hot, fresh food on the buffet rather than leftovers from the noon seating. We might give it another try if we could go earlier in the day.then again, we might just go to Sunnyledge or Savoy instead.",1
"It's open 24 hours a day and serves breakfast at all times, but eat here as a last resort. n nThere are definitely better restaurants at this resort, but this is the cheapest. for a reason. I had the eggs, bacon and hash browns that also came with something they were calling a biscuit. but I have not yet received the sample back from the lab to verify this claim. n nThe ""restaurant "" is overlooking the smoke filled casino which is better than staring at four walls I suppose. They had a large menu selection, but I would be afraid to try much of it. n nEat here after you lose all of your money at the craps table and feel like punishing yourself.",1
"I had heard about La Condesa from friends and wanted to try it. I went with a friend for dinner and had the chicken burrito and soft taco. My friend had another combo. Chips were great and liked the salsa choices, but was let down by the main meal. The burrito although tasty, was mostly meat. The soft taco was flavorful but nothing exciting. I have had better in Phoenix. My friend said his meal was served on the cold side a was a bit salty. Glad I tried La Condesa but will not go back.",1
"Haven't I reviewed this place before?! I LOVE HOT! n nReason I came on this day is because a friend from Napa, CA was in town for shows and I brought her here last time she was in town and it was her request that we come again. Like I said, I LOVE this place and you'll have a hard time getting me to decline. n nHowever, on this particular visit I have to say my meal was just okay. Generally it's fantastic but what I ordered just wasn't up to par. I had the chicken and dumplings as my entree. Again, everything else was very nice. It was a very cold evening but we kept shuffling closer to the heat lamps and sharing our jackets, doing whatever was necessary to keep warm. nSo the meal I wasn't so satisfied with the chicken was dry. I prefer dark meat because it's moist, white meat is always risky because it gets dry and I can't choke that stuff down so easily unless you make it into a chicken salad. Dry white meat not great. The dumplings were DEVINE and I want the recipe. Mmm mmm MMMM! n nOur server, Greg, was wonderful and was on top of the recommendations and descriptions. nSuprisingly it was very busy on that chilly eve and that kept him busy too. n nMy guests from Napa, Oakland, and Paso Robles enjoyed their meal and the experience. Hopefully they'll have an opportunity to come again when it's a bit warmer and we have more daylight hours to enjoy the views that surround.",2
"P Stone has great food, a casual atmosphere, and pretty friendly staff.

They've got Wi Fi, which always is a selling point for me, and it's great to go and sit alone with the computer. n nThe games in the backroom are a lot of fun, and I've been to a few shows there.

"Same experience as above, booked months in advance and when I called to confirm they couldn't find me. The initial reservation was for Vdara but because they dropped the ball they had to book us a day before we were going to Vegas. The only had suites at Signature which is supposed to be nicer bur still. They sent us a confirmation number and all, but when we called Signature on the way to Vegas to confirm the reservation they said that it was cancelled by the owner. Multiple calls to Jet Luxury and multiple calls to Signature and we got a suite booked. Extremely frustrating and weird business model, not sure how they survive. I want to mention Yolanda who was most helpful on the phone, but I the whole experience with Jet Luxury was weird, frustrating and bad overall. This was a TravelZoo deal so maybe they have a different standard for their full price customers. This review is for Jet Luxury, not related to Signature, I have a separate review for them",1
"This was my 3rd visit to BVD since it opened. The first 2 times we were there I was unimpressed with the food, but my family wanted to try it again, so we went this Sunday for brunch. The ""all day breakfast "" menu was all we were allowed to have since the regular breakfast menu ends at 11am. While disappointed, we understood. We were seated in the bar area after a brief wait and initially, service was good but went downhill fast. Our server was also bartending, so wearing 2 hats began to affect our service, we ordered my daughter's milkshake 3x. I give our server 5 stars though, he had a great attitude and was very nice, apologizing for our wait. The pimento stuffed jalapenos are HUGE!, but lacking in taste in a big way, no kick and the pimento cheese was runny and bland. The corned beef hash left my NJ, diner loving fiance unimpressed, as did my own greek omelet that was overcooked. The home fries really aren't ""fries "" but smushed greasy potatoes. Neither of us ate ours. On a brighter note, my teenage daughter liked her sliders and fries. We waited a long time between apps and our main dishes as well. I hate to give poor reviews, especially to Xenia, as we are big Ilios Noche fans, but after a third unimpressive experience at Big View, we won't be back.",1

You will not find any major brands such as Kellogg's cereals or Jif peanut butter. What you will find is that most items are their very own brand, and have yet to be disappointed by any I have tried. Even the frozen section has some really tasty items. And another very nice thing about Trader Joe's . a great selection of inexpensive wines. So give them a try you will be glad you did. n n nAlso I read another review stating that out of 2 visits, and only 2 visits,bad product was purchased on both occasions. . sort of defies the odds , don't you think ?",2

All the reviews I read and all of the feedback from friends built this place up and I was hoping for an awesome pizza place that would be nearby. n nEnd result, I simply can not understand the cult like following of this restaurant. n nI mean, it is hard to mess up pizza. You have to seriously be a pretty bad if you can't turn out a decent pie. n nGrimaldi's pizza was simply average. Our pizza came out and looked great, but as soon as you picked up a piece, dark grease poured quite literally off. As a result, flavor and texture wise the pizza was a near equivalent of the ""pizza "" from Sbarro's or any other mall pizza. n nI have been to Cibo, Bianco, and the like. Overall the best pizza I have found is from Picazzo's.",1
"I had stayed here back in January for a work related convention. I believe that they were still in the process of remodeling the resort, but I was still pleasantly surprised. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. If you are looking for a party place that you don't have to go anywhere else, this might not be your place. But if you are just looking for a nice comfortable place to stay and gamble a little while still being in the strip, check this place out. The staff was friendly and very helpful when I needed anything. I would definitely stay here again.",2
"THE MOST HORRIBLE PLACE ! went there today for lunch, ordered 3 regular size shrimp po boys. The place was almost empty, two other tables and us. it took them 25 minutes to get the food that was tasteless. I got 3 miserable shrimps in my sandwich. nwhen I wanted to get the check, I had to look for the server who was sitting in the back with her smartphone. I will never go there again, and I do NOT recommend this place to anyone. If you got a Groupon, GET YOUR MONEY BACK !",1
This place is awesome! Had lunch there yesterday so happy it's 5 min away from my house. Great food! If you have been to Laibela it's comparable. Had the veggie meat combo it's huge could feed 3! Go check it out.,2
"Worst whole wheat bagel I've ever had. I was starving and still couldn't finish it. Yuck, would not recommend going here at all.",1
"You can't judge anyone by the way you look.Food was excellent! But my server gave me blah service while he was kissing ass to the older ladies by me. Tipping is very important and I base tips by the service. I am very generous because I work for tips as well. With this service, he did not deserve anything. NO TIP FOR YOU! ",1
"If you're too full for a buffet, Earl's is perfect. If you're in the mood to grab a little snack while walking the strip, Earl's is perfect. If you're on the way to grab a Fat Tuesday and you want a snack to go with it, Earl's is perfect. After the club, when you're hella hungry and you need something to sober your drunk ass up , Earl's is perfect. n nI highly recommend the Caprese sandwich.All my friends got different sandwiches too and we were all pretty satisfied with what we got. You're already spending hella money in Vegas either on gambling, hotel, clubs, dranks, whatevz. Earl's is cheap and hella good !",2
"shellac and a great pedicure. they are able to do the shellac gel nails on both your manicure and pedicure which is hard to find. i also love the girls working here. n nit's a family run business and it's stuck in this random empty shopping center, you would never expect it or see it but it's always packed. n nsince i've been trying to hunt down a new salon, this is so far my new favorite and the first one i am making a 2nd visit to. n ndefinitely recommend.",2
"I used to go there until they kept giving me to their new employee of the day who would invariably not do a good job. I'd have to ask the owner to ""fix "" the mess and after a while I got tired of having to ask so I stopped going. Everyone was nice but my nails weren't always done well.",1
"Monta Ramen was scarily packed, so we came here instead. Delicious cheap ramen. What's not to like? My only complaint is the wait and cash only policy. It's a good away from the strip option.",2
"This is one of the nicer theatres near me for sure. n nIt's enormous so it's always playing everything, it has IMAX and 3D, it has a separate bar and restaurant, I think? upstairs, the seating is cushy and comfortable, and the theatres are always very clean. Oh, and they have a huge parking lot, too, which is fantastic. I hate having to fight for parking. Basically, everything is enormous. The first time I went, it actually took me a little bit of time to figure out where to buy tickets because the lobby is so huge. They have more than your average movie theatre food offerings, as well, and they even have a little cafe on the inside, if you're into that. n nMy biggest complaint? Last time we went, the bathrooms were gross. Like really, really, really gross. They definitely need to clean those with whatever frequency they are cleaning the theatres. n nOtherwise, it's a nice theatre that plays a ton of movies in an ideal location. You can go out for dinner or drinks before or after the movie and you don't have to drive.",2
"I concur with the prior reviewer.this place is horrible to deal with. RUN, DON'T WALK away from this company. They have the most unresponsive customer service program around, they do not deliver what they promise, and they consistently fail to maintain adequate contact with their customers. I have tried to contact management in the past to deal with my complaints, but they shield themselves with rather powerless customers service reps.sending their reps ""into the trenches "" as it were while the middle managers hide from any responsiveness and responsibility. The CSRs once you can get them are polite and concerned but clearly without adequate information or authority necessary to resolve a problem. Find another company to get your medical supplies from, this one is owned and run by hucksters and sham artists.that.or incredibly inept business managers! It is apparent that all they care about is the profit with no concern about the consumers they are supposed to serve.",1
"I was just visiting Phoenix over the weekend for the Rock N Roll Marathon on Jan. 14th. We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! nI can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa. GOOD salsa ! nWe were so pleased with our meal service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky tasteful salsa, I just ran a marathon ! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties.GOOD! nI will return on any visit to Phoenix!",2
"Oh so expensive. .and worth every penny! Four adults with four customized buffalo burgers, a shake, 2 side salads, fries, zucchini and two sodas cost a little over 110. n nWhere else can you go to get a delicious buffalo burger? Its not something we do everyday, but we looked forward and planned ahead for this. n nDeliberately with a try! I would add pictures but the phone died. .maybe next year I'll easier for my phone to charge.",2
"So I stopped in hoping to get food to go. let me start by saying I wasn't from the area and didn't know they did not do take out. After ASKING about it, the cook who I am guessing was the owner as well told me if I wanted food to go, that there was a McDonald's down the street. So I left. n n nI agree places can do ""No Takeout "" but don't be rude about it. n nAlso, when you tell me it will be 10 minutes before you can help me, and that I needed to tell the people walking in it will be 20 minutes before they are helped, you need to pay me the salary for my time. n n nNeedless to say, I will not be back, nor ever recommend it to anyone.",1
"Great Japanese food experience, but in a old Victorian era home!",2
"Just heard this place closed as of 7 31 2014. Why am I not surprised? Such a disappointment. Guess I won't get the chance to give it another chance. Can we have Blue Burrito back now, please?",1
"With 1,284 reviews on McCarran International Airport, there is a great chance this review will be buried like a gambler in the desert. Hopefully it will be accessable in the next couple of days. With that said here is review 1,285 on McCarran International Airport from this point foward referred to as McCarran . n n Airports are very important. Besides their primary purpose of serving air travelers, they are a gateway to the city. Airports give travelers their first and last impression of the city. They are a reflection of the city. n n McCarran is a first rate gateway to Las Vegas. Going back to the 90s, when I flew between McCarran and New York airports, it left me with a positive first and last impression of Las Vegas. It is a reflection of the good things about Las Vegas. It is upbeat. Coming off a long flight, there is nothing more cheerful than hearing the bells of the one arm bandits. To this day it is a welcoming sound after ending a vacation. Like Las Vegas, McCarran is modern. The monorail between terminals is one of the first to be used at an airport. Recently McCarran replaced the international terminal with a brand new state of the art facility. Like Las Vegas, McCarran features plenty of fast food restaurants and Starbuck's. The list of fast food restaurants keep growing. As far as Starbuck's, they are at the majority of the terminals and even outside security at baggage claim. Just like Las Vegas McCarran is crowded with long lines that move efficiently. And just like Las Vegas, I am a fan of McCarran.",2
"GREAT, superb chocolate and desserts! n nYou really should go here. n nDocked one star because I showed up with a group of 15 or so about twenty minutes before they closed down, and they told me 'sorry, we're closed,' and then agreed to serve us takeout only, and not the full menu. There's nothing wrong with closing when it's time to close.it's just that some places would go above and beyond instead, being more concerned about earning 15 repeat customers.",2
"Had a poor dining experience here last night. Although the ambiance was fine the noise from the casino was indiscernible , poor food quality prep doomed the meal. My colleague ordered salmon. I ordered the house specialty, bone in ribeye which carried a hefty premium . We both eschewed the 24 prix fixe menu, opting instead for the regular dinners which include choice of soup or mixed greens salad and chef's choice vegetable. nAfter ordering we were served a bread basket which included two small pretzel bread sticks and two mini ciabbata. The pretzel bread was disappointing, doughy and not flavorful. The ciabbata was fine. nSalad arrived. Greens consisted of iceberg only, small, with 2 miniature cherry size pear tomatoes three slices of cucumber and a couple red onion rings. Although the dressings were ok, iceberg is not acceptable for a house salad unless specified. nMy main course I ordered the steak Pittsburgh. It was thick over an inch came more medium than blue probably they cannot keep the grill hot and was the toughest steak I have ever had from a supposed steakhouse. Tougher even than Outback. Note that Austin's does not advertise aged beef it clearly wasn't. Had problems cutting it with the steak knife. Moreover, though the seasonings and the sauce were tasty, the beef lacked flavor. I didn't bother to take out the leftovers. nMy friend's main course he ordered the grilled salmon. It was overcooked, meaning gray and dry throughout and portions of it had been oversalted. nThe vegetable served was thin string beans. They too were tough. nI also ordered creamed spinach a la carte. This was the best thing we had, but lacked flavor as well no salt or nutmeg , but, hey it had cream and butter in it, so how bad could it be. nThis was my first and last visit. I had heard that Austin's was expensive and good. Looks to me like they lowered the prices and the quality of their meats and preparation. Be advised.",1
"Walking in you know you are in for a treat. The space is beautiful and rustic with an absolutely gorgeous etched in metal sign for the restaurant. It has a beautiful rustic glow from the different light fixtures and an enormous bar that even when full wasn't too loud for us to be able to hear each other above. n nWent here last night for dinner with a group of five which started with us having to call and ask if we could push back our reservation by an hour and they assured us it was no problem. n nThere seemed to be a question about where they where going to seat us once we got there, but they where able to make a high top table work. I hope in the future to go back and try one of their comfy looking booths! n nService was a bit disjointed. It seemed as though we had to ask a bit for everything like more water and for a bread basket , but overall food was served at a steady pace and was coursed out as we asked for it to be. n nThe food was delicious! We decided to order a bunch of small plates to share and where very happy with our choices. n nWhat we sampled n nSeared Gnocchi The texture was perfection. Light and airy, yet filling and rustic with the wild mushrooms and watercress. n nCrispy Brussels Sprouts Out of this world delicious. The blue cheese was not overpowering even though there where some sizeable chunks throughout. So good! n nRoasted Wild Mushroom Flatbread Good. Out of all of the things we ordered this was the least favorite, but not because it was bad, it was just that everything else was so good! n nHot Rocks We chose three proteins, scallop, tuna, and american kobe wagyu . This was very novel and fun for sharing. All of the proteins where delicious and only enhanced by the accompaniments especially the sweet soy which we kept and dunked the other food into because it was so delicious! n nTruffled Fries So good we had to order two. Absolutely out of this world! The bacon rosemary aioli was delicious and the truffle flavor was perfect and not overwhelming. n nWe also had a few drinks which everyone was happy with and enjoyed immensely which included the Antioxidant, Rose's Old Fashioned, and the Prickly Pear Margarita! n nI can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!",2
"You don't get to take chicken strips from the lunch menu, put them on a very average waffle and call it Chicken and Waffles! Thesse were by far the worst Chicken and Waffles I've ever had. They weren't even good chicken strips. Please please please go find someone's grandmother's fried chicken recipe and start over again. You should immediately take these things off your menu. They were HORRIBLE! n nWow! Ok! Now that I've got that out of my system, The Grand Lux Cafe has always been a ""Go to "" spot whenever we've stayed at the Venetian. It's the affordable dining establishment. Overall the food has always been pretty good and they're open 24 hours. I'm sure I'll stumble in again some time.",1
This place is good. They have some issues with customer service sometimes. They are not very helpful when you are waiting for a iPhone Launch. I wouldn't take your mac here. Go to Chandler Fashion Center.,2
"Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing! Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries, and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger! A great place to be drunk in, not so great to be hung over in. They have your typical greasy spoon fare, so don't go if you're concerned about your health. Otherwise, eat on brave soul, eat on!",1
"You have to have some set of balls to have the word ""spice "" in your name and put out food as bland as this place does! It's like it all came out of the same buffet leftover tupperware. Worst chinese food I have ever had. Service was just average at best. When I can say Panda Express is way better than this place and that's not saying anything , I suggest you eat ANYWHERE else.",1
"Less than impressed. we asked the host to sit outside and he acted put out that he had to set the table! Rude. As we sat outside waiting 10th min for our over perfumed waitress, we scanned the sad breakfast menu. We ordered a simple bacon, eggs and potato meal, and the breakfast pizza. Thirty minutes later, we received Bacon that was clearly stuck together as if thrown in a microwave and then onto the plate, the smallest serving of potatoes, eggs, a thin slice of orange and a half of a strawberry. REALLY? If youre going to bring a half done meal, don't bring it on a plate that you need to spread the food so thin to cover surface area. the pizza was actually ok if you like really cheesy greased up soggy crusted pizza.",1

They have an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. Wish I had checked before I joined.",1
"I've stayed at the Biltmore twice, once was a five star experience, and the other was about a three, so I'll split the difference and give them a four. n nThe first time I stayed here was in a super cute cottage. We had fabulous service from everyone. The only complaint I had with this trip was that housekeeping knocked at 9 AM which they did on my second trip too . I realize nine is not ungodly, but it's a little early to be hustled out of your room so someone can make your bed, that you would have never left if you didn't have to stop the persistent knocking from the other side of the door. So that sucked. But besides that it was a great experience. n nThis last time was okay. We got a great deal on the room and they let us check in super early, which was awesome. The air wasn't working when we first got to the room, but I'll let them off the hook for that because they quickly fixed it and the room was cool before the 4 00 check in time, so for all I know that was their plan the whole time. My boyfriend spent the morning golfing and even though it was miserably hot, had a great time. The bartenders at the pool were nice enough, and we were pretty obnoxious, so nice enough is pretty much all we could hope for. n nOne of the sinks in the bathroom didn't drain and the cosmetic mirror in the bathroom was broken not the mirror the little thing that kept it stable in the wall , so that was a minor inconvenience that I wouldn't normally expect from resorts of this caliber. n nWe also got a couple in room massages, which were great, but then due to a misunderstanding with the credit cards on file I used mine for the room, my boyfriend used his for the massages , I got charged for both the room AND the massages. And, god bless my boyfriend, but I really can't rationalize spending 400 on a couple 55 minute backrubs unless that back rub comes with, say, an iPod. I called Biltmore and they said they could reverse the charges and put them on another card, but it might be easier to just ask him for the cash. So he paid me back but I obviously wish I could have avoided it all together. I mean, that's awkward right? To have someone do a nice gesture for you and then you end up accidentally paying for the nice gesture so you have to awkwardly bring up that while the gesture was nice, you kind of can't pay for it and omg I already feel like I'm on an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm so I'll just stop right there and hope you get the point. It was very stressful for me. n nAssuming you don't share my social etiquette neurosis, I'm sure you'll have a great time at the Biltmore. The summer rates are unbeatable, and if you can stay at a Cottage do so because they are just adorable, especially by the little putt putt holes. Just make sure to double check your room upon check in and double check your folio upon check out and you'll be fine.",2
"Got a gel manicure there on Monday 01.28.2012, by that evening it was chipping. Today, Thursday, 01.31.2012, 6 1 2 nails have had the color peel off. Also, the color has yellowed. The guy that did the manicure fiiled my nails after the color was put on. Not sure, never saw that before. He is also pretty rough, I felt quite man handled when I left.

"Close to the Convention Center and fine dining in the Las Vegas Hotel. Free parking. Late making up the room the first day so we nipped in and put our lunch leftovers away and went to a movie. The second day they were not there by 2 pm so we put the DND sign out and were napping. Housekeeping actually called, woke us up to ask if they could make up the room as the sign was out. Not clear on the concept. Both days no vacuuming happened as crumbs were on the floor from a pretzel spill. I thought I was tracking in dirt from outside as I noticed my feet were dirty so I showered and cleaned them. I picked up and put clothes out for the next day and sat on the bed with my feet up and while I had been walking around they had gotten dirty again. The carpet was the culprit. I wiped it with a dry napkin and it got dirty. I got a damp towel and it got really dirty with out even much of a wipe. I decided to keep my sandals on when in the room. Gym was good, to cold to use the pool and spa. I took pictures so I could show the Hilton how icky it was.",1
"If you want a nice breakfast out in Vegas, go here. Their bakery and deli counter is the best feature of this place they have a huge selection of decadent desserts, meatz, cheezez, and of course, bagelz. It's easy and quick to get your order and get out when ordering at the counter. The last time we went there my gal and I got a raspberry strawberry? can't remember exactly danish and it was pretty damn good. I'm sure there are some desserts in there that are a bit dry but overall it's a win win. I'd prefer to get a bag o' bagels over dining in and getting a bagel entr u00e9e. n nSunday morning breakfast is a nice atmosphere because it's quite bustling however, it might be a while before you are seated and the service may seem a bit moony and often cold. I suggest getting an omelette when dining in with a side bagel if you're dying for a nice big breakfast because the other big breakfasts aren't really that appetizing. Not that the omelettes are supermodels, but they're pretty great. n nOverall, it's a pretty good place. If you're visiting LV, it's far enough away from the strip that it makes it nice to get away from that snake pit but close enough that you don't have to drive hours for a simple meal. Good luck finding a place to park as their lot sux and is surrounded by dentists.",2
"Five stars all the way! So many things to love about the Four Seasons n n The grounds are beautiful and lush and give off the feeling of being somewhere tropical. n n Customer service is exceptional! Everyone was professional and courteous during our stay and I appreciated the nice little touches such as valet providing us with bottled water when bringing out our car. Much needed in 115 degree weather! n n The main hallway from the lobby to the guest elevators smells SO GOOD! n n Guest rooms are clean, comfortable, modern, spacious, and very nicely appointed. Evening turn down service was a nice treat. n n Verandah is a good option for dining within the hotel. I enjoyed their afternoon tea service as well as brunch out by the pool. Thank goodness for the clouds that morning as well as the misters! n n Their hotel bar Press extends out into the pool area and is a nice place to relax with a drink or two at night surrounded by pretty lights. n n Location is great if you are seeing a concert at Mandalay Bay. One walk through the door leads you right into that hotel. When coming back from super busy Mandalay you will appreciate the peace and tranquility the Four Seasons offers! n n Location is especially great for me since my favorite shows in Vegas to see Jabbawockeez and Thunder From Down Under p are next door at Luxor and Excalibur. There is a tram that goes to those hotels from Mandalay as well as a walkway that takes you through both of those hotels. n n They allow dogs here! If Vegas were more dog friendly I would definitely take Lulu here. n nSome things to note n This is very much a family friendly hotel and while there were quite a few families with kids on our stay it did not take away from the overall relaxing ambiance of the hotel. n Elevators can get busy during peak pool time with people families going to coming from the pool. n Valet is unfortunately not free. n nI must say that overall I enjoyed my stay at the Four Seasons and it is now my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. If there were good deals throughout the year I would totally stay here on most if not every visit!",2
"My husband, father in law and I went to Milagros grill for my husband's birthday. All I can really say is DELICIOUS! I had the papa y carne flatbread and it's one of the best meals I've had. ever. My husband had the surf and turf and my father in law had the short ribs. Everything was delicious. The atmosphere was great. I was so happy that we chose to go there. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the service could have been a bit better. We will definitely be back!",2
"i've been here on several occasions. friendly staff and fresh bagels. i went used the drive through yesterday morning and they gave me my bagel in a jiffy. fast service! n nthe only thing about bagel joints is that they practically slather a pound of cream cheese on your bagel no matter if you go here or Einstein's. one bad this about this place is that every time i get a half dozen bagels i get charge a totally different prices on 3 occasions what's up with that? at least keep a consistent price on your bagels. ugh! n ni still love this place though. i especially love cinnamon sugar bagel, it's got that caramelize sugar on there and when you take a bite it'll crackle. it's pure goodness.",2
This is the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas by far! We have tried most of their menu items and everything is prepared well the lamb is tender as is the chicken. They are able to prepare dishes with great flavors that are not nearly as spicy as most Indian food. The Lamb Mantra Chicken Sag are favorites as are the Onion Kulcha Garlic Naan. Prices are very reasonable we always bring home enough for a 2nd meal.,2
"Purchased a Groupon and even waited a month before trying to redeem. It didn't matter the wait was 30 45 minutes so we decided to wait, outside in the cold! While I was waiting I noticed a sign on the front door that said a gratuity of 18 would be added to all Groupon customers. I have been a long time Groupon customer and have never seen that before. Is that even legal? Especially since it isnt stated anywhere on the Groupon. It is called a gratuity people! And who do they think they are telling me how much I have to leave as a tip. In general my husband and I leave 20 depending on the service. So I guess they lost out there. Its just the principle! After waiting 35 minutes to get seated and another 10 to order we finally ordered only for me to find out they were out of what I had wanted. The main thing they did that really showed me that customer service was important to them was they actually gave my husband and I our Groupon back after eating so we could come back and try them again. I will let you know how it goes next time.More to come",1
"More and more frequently I patronize the Eastern at Serene 7 eleven, on my way to work. Why? It is convenient and clean. n Going back to the early 1990s, when I was using a land line, I have been a fan of 7 eleven's flavored coffee. After all these years, I still savor their blueberry coffee. On those 100 plus days in Vegas I'll pick up a Big Gulp. n Seven Eleven's wild card is the fuel station.When it is time to fuel up my car, I will try to go here. Coffee and fuel. A few years back when they changed from Citgo to 7 eleven branded fuel, I was skeptical. That was a couple of years ago. I had used 7 eleven branded fuel numerous times throughout my Aura's lease, and I had zero problems. n The employees here are also friendly.",2
"This place is always great! I will always make the trip to the strip open 24 hours a day for these sandwiches! You can not beat the price or the service, Ive never waited over 10 minutes for my food. and Ive never had anything that I didnt like. The ham and swiss and french dip are my favorites.",2
"I tried Wan Fu back in August 2012 because of the rave reviews and friend recommendations. n nOn the menu I noticed the prices are considerably higher than other Chinese restaurants in the area. Now, I understand that there's a difference between greasy garbage chinese food and quality chinese food. But even still, the prices were still high 4 to 6 higher per entree . So I figured they must give larger portions than normal. NOPE, not the case. n nAlso, the food didn't surpass any quality of other local chinese restaurants. I think Wild East is just as good, if not better. Great Wall is also a solid choice. I just didn't see the 4 per plate premium going anywhere. To top it off, a low sanitation rating. even for a chinese restaurant. I noticed this when I picked up my food. n nThe food was good, not great. The hostess was very nice. The prices are unnecessarily high IMO. Overall, not worth it.",1
"It pains me to write this review, this experience was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. nFirst off, if you book through expedia, you can't have your spouse check in for you. It has to be the person listed on the expedia order. Unfortunately, what that meant for me was checking in at 11 45pm, instead of 4pm with all of our luggage after working a wedding for 10 hours. nSecond, the check in line wait was dreadful. We asked for a non smoking room, which was pretty far from the registration desk. Upon getting closer, there was a couple in front our room hanging on the floor of the hallway. Our room was below average and smelled like smoke. It didn't help that the next door neighbors sounded like there were 20 people in there. Too noisy so we asked to be moved to a quiet room. nThe staff was helpful in changing the room and the new one was decent looking and smelled MUCH better. nThe room service was good and our server was friendly. nI love everything having to do with Egypt and pyramids, just not this place.",1
Great show. Kind of strange story and many kids however were talking in the audience,2
The food is money. The service is bankrupt! n nI love the food but our server was a joke she had no clue what was even on the menu. She moved slower that my 80 year old grandmother! Can you say airhead!,2
"After having had some underwhelming meals at our hotel and around the convention district, this place was a BIG treat. The service was spot on, and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker , our entrees did not disappoint. Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon I'd definitely come back if this were in my city!",2
"I wanted so much to like Pei Wei. I did. I went twice, getting different dishes both times. My mom raved about it, so I gave it a shot. and while I can't remember what I ate, I do recall bad stomach pains and not being able to get the taste out of my mouth for some time. And by some time, I mean I went here for dinner both times, didn't feel so hot after dinner. then felt awful the entire next day. I have to do my stomach a favor and not touch this food again.",1
"We've been to Cheddars twice now and both experiences were wrought with service issues. The first visit had two servers competing for our table, making us very uncomfortable. One would bring our drinks and the other would bring more and take away the ones that the first server brought because she added lemon when we asked for no lemon . The second visit had a single server that couldn't get anything right. We never received the appetizer we ordered and the food took forever to get out. She seemed to be very attentive to the table across from us but we had to ask for sweetener three times. She was apologetic but just seemed scattered with us anyway . On that particular visit my son and I walked in just 30 seconds after the rest of the family and the hostess could not remember where she'd just sat them. Huh? So do you think she tried to help us locate our family? No. She went back to a chatty conversation with the other hostess while we walked the restaurant in search of our table. This is a relatively new restaurant so I'm trying to be patient as they work through getting their staff up to speed and properly trained. The food is good and the atmosphere is really nice, but one more service issue and that'll be three strikes, making Cheddars out!",1
So far this is my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Service and the quality of food is awesome. n nEverytime I come I get the AYCE AYCD Sun Thur deal ! Start off with there baked mussels and scallops then off with the rolls. I'm a big fan of baked rolls and their baked rolls are tasty ! n nDon't forget to try the specials on the board behind the sushi bar !,2
"At 39 person, this place didn't offer much for the money. The line for the sushi limited selection to Tuna only , crab legs, and cocktail shrimp was long for a buffet layout. Food is limited in selection, I found better places on the Las Vegas strip and Rio for a better deal. We were there on Saturday of the Memorial Day weekend and there was no line at all! so expensive and far from the strip.",1
"Well, I'd read some great reviews so I was excited to try it. The decor was great and the service was awesome too, but the prices and the food leave alot to be desired. We boyfriend and I got there at 530pm. The chips and salsa are complimentary, but the salsa was thick and tasted like they used alot of chili powder. My boyfriends loves salsa and he couldn't even eat it. I compare all my salsa to my favorite at Mi Patio, and I haven't found anything that compares to it, so I wasn't expecting anything better, but this salsa was really bad. nWe both ordered a margarita. The drinks came in a standard size bar glass. I also ordered just one taco.a shrimp taco. nThe big surprise was the bill. 9 ea for the margaritas.and 4.25 for the taco. I felt like I just threw 30 out the window. nOh, and there's NO happy hour. I was told the happy hour was from 11a to 5pm. What? nYes, it's hip, yes, it's cool.and I don't mind paying for great food drinks, but it was definitely not worth the high prices. The margaritas would've been priced around 4.25 at any other mexican joint and that tiny taco should've been about 1.25! The tortilla was the size of a small pancake and had just 2.yes 2.shrimp inside.we each got a bite. nI'm still kicking myself for paying that kind of money for nothing special!",1
"Amazing food and Brian is the best. I recommend ""Livin' La Vida Loca "" and ""Bang a Gong "".",2
"Excellent steak and lobster, service always above average. Nice semi fancy restaurant for special occasions. Wish they would bring back the sour dough bread, French is a poor substitute. Highly recommend",2
"I had some friends in town this weekend. They were staying in North Scottsdale and I am in Gilbert. I remembered hearing that Saddle Ranch had a good hangover breakfast. It was a good middle spot. nWe show up and the place is empty. We could not find any staff so we seated ourselves on the patio. When the waitress showed up the first thing she said to us was that next time we are here we must tell someone we are sitting outside or we won't get served. Well, we would have told someone if there was someone to tell. nWe ordered our drinks and they took forever. Our waitress Ms. Personality came back to take our food order. We all had some sort of egg dish. 3 people in the group ordered EB's and asked for runny yolks. When the food finally came out, their eggs we like hockey pucks. Ms. Personality said that is how they come.whatever. nI had the Huveos Rancheros. My eggs were done perfectly so no complaints there. The food was still completely forgettable. Portions are huge but who cares when the food sucks. nThe manager came by and we told him about the eggs and he said ""thanks for letting me know "". That's it nothing beyond that. nThe girls that work here look like someone put their clothes through a paper shredder. A little ridiculous for 9 00am. nBypass this place and go to The Breakfast Club across the street!",1
"An excellent place for an early lunch as it fills up fast! It's huge inside and will remind you of a cross between an Olive Garden and a Macaroni Grill. n nSimilar food as the above mentioned restaurants with a tad nicer dining room. n nService was VERY good and FAST. Food comes quickly. n nMeals that include the salad are few, but for what it's worth, the chopped salad is incredible! It's a meal by itself so make sure to share it. n nThe bread and crackers included with the meal aren't memorable and aren't served with any oil or spices. Just butter.",2
Attention to detail in this place is just awesome! Great back patio. Highly recommend it!,2
"If I could give negative stars, I would. The first man I encountered was very helpful and got me to put a down payment on a mattress to save the sale price. I go in four days later to buy my mattress in full and the second salesman I encountered was rude, pushy, and overbearing. He didn't want to give me my initial receipt back literally stopped me from grabbing it off of the table and acted very shady. . He talked down to me the entire time probably because I am young and a woman and was very aggressive. I still paid for my mattress but left VERY upset. I immediately went to another mattress store and got a much better deal down the road at mattress firm. I will never again go to best mattress. I am STILL waiting for my refund to be processed! Waste of time and money at this place!",1
"Getting together with a girlfriend of mine involves Nolen Kitchen 9 times out of 10. Why? It's predictable, solid food, with a variety of drink and menu options. Plus, there's a patio that's lovely in the summer and heated in the winter. Count me in! n nI always order the zucchini chips and the country greek salad. Every time. And usually some sort of relatively inexpensive wine. The zucchini chips alone are enough to send me in the direction of this location. n nParking is nothing short of nightmarish, and you'll find yourself parking half a mile down the road, or across the street illegally, mind you just to enjoy dinner. n nService is top notch. I've never had an unpleasant experience.",2

"For a large car wash company this location does a really good job at washing your car in a timely manner. They are also willing to haggle with you over the price and additional services which is always nice because you feel like you're getting a little extra that you wouldn't normally ask for. The window replacement guys are still there and hover around your car like a vulture, but I always tell them that I have an appointment already and don't feel like cancelling it. I also like that Danny's keeps your license plate on file so you can acquire free washes without having to keep another frequent shopper card. Another huge plus is they are one of the few full service washes open on a Sunday.",2
"I stayed here with a friend for one night. We had a room with two queen beds on the 26th floor in the Palace Tower. The room was spacious and had a nice view. The bathroom had a Jacuzzi tub and separate shower, It was a huge bathroom. Overall, I thought it was a nice room and would not hesitate to stay in a similar room at Caesar's again. n nThe hotel itself is huge. The guy at the desk said two miles. With the Shops and all, I can see that. The good part is that the width takes up at least a block, maybe even two, so we were able to walk through the Forum Shops in air conditioning and thus avoided the 108 degree heat for part of our walk to the Venetian.",2
"I'll echo what another reviewer said 1 star is 1 too many. After two hours the movers never showed. First I was told they had picked up another ""quick job "" at MY SCHEDULED TIME and would be an hour late. One hour later they're still a no show, so I call and am told to give them another 30 minutes. Thirty minutes later no one shows and I call and cancel. Despite all the haggling no one ever apologized. Moving is stressful enough. Save yourself the worry and AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.",1

"I don't understand why people write that this part of town is sketchy. It didn't seem sketchy to me. I went with a couple locals, and they said that parts of Fremont street have the bars where locals hang out. We walked by some of them, and I agreed they look nice!

"I grew up in Mesa but never heard of this place until last year. My husband and I had lunch there. What a disappointment that was. We were seated and waited for 15 minutes, still no server. I called over another server from across the room and asked who our server was. He pointed over to a young girl who was standing up against the wall talking, giggling and flirting with a male server. She had been over there the whole time and I didn't realize she was our server. Well things changed pretty quickly when I walked over to her and asked if we could get served because our lunch time was running out and we had already been there waiting for 15 minutes. No apology, just a little snicker and smile at the guy she had been talking too. After this experience, I didn't want to ever go back there. Well, this past weekend, we were in the area for business and my husband talked me into giving it another try. Another big disappointment! It was crowded but we were able to be seated after a 15 minute wait. The problem began with that. The hostess took us the wrong way and when she turned around to go the right way, five different servers got in the way and blocked me from following my husband and the hostess. One male server was even rude and made a nasty comment to me as I tried to make my way past them. One of the female servers giggled at his comment and shoved me into the wall. I lost sight of where my husband and the hostess went. I was so frustrated that I went back to the front of the resturant and just sat down to wait for the hostess to come back. She totally ignored me when she came back up to the station. I sat there for 10 minutes, texting my husband and then finally called him. It was so noisy he couldn't hear his phone at first. He finally came up and got me and took me back to our table. The person who brings chips and salsa and the male server who took our order were the best things about this place. They were both hispanic and a little older. The rest of the staff here look like a bunch of high school kids and they act like it as well. Very rude! Now on to the food very bland, no flavor. My stuffed quesedilla had no flavor to it what so ever. Taco Bell serv es more flavorful stuff than this place. As my husband was trying to eat his fajita's, the bus boy another young kid, took his basket of tortillas. He called out to the guy to bring them back and was just ignored. He had to wait for 10 minutes to hail our server and get more tortillas to finish his meal. The best thing about our meal was the beer and the strawberry marguerita. I can honestly say this place is a major disappointment and they are truly lucky that I am retired from broadcasting because I would certainly share my views on the airwaves. They should understand the first rule of any business, treat the customer with respect and don't be rude. Learn some manners. As we walked into the parking lot, we were discussing what just happened and we were overheard by someone apparently in management as she was unloading her car. She followed us and stopped us. She mentioned what she overheard and asked us for more information. We shared our experiences for both times we came here. She then said that they just had a staff meeting a week prior to discuss those very issues. REALLY? Wow! Apparently the staff didn't listen and they obviously don't care about their reputation or how to treat people. After hearing this, I definitely know that I will never recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever step foot in there again. A real shame.",1
"Alright. I'm going to be the bad guy and give the AZ Science Center a 2 star rating. n nIn my mind, the key to a successful hands on exhibit is n1. Demonstrate a cool science topic with a ""wow "" factor that grabs my attention n2. Now that you've got my attention, explain what just happened, and why it happened. TEACH ME SOMETHING. n nThe exhibits in this museum are SEVERELY lacking in the second half. n nYou have to understand I'm a 5 year old science geek at heart. Which means I love to play with toys, but I also love to find out what makes the toys tick. n nPush down on this platform and a smoke ring ejects from a big box. Wow that was cool.

Wow, that was cool. What made that happen? Oh, no explanation, I guess I'll move onto the next exhibit. n nYou can see the pattern here. n nAnother big beef I had was that there were way too many stations for kids to just play with legos or draw with crayons or make origami. ""This is how a house is built. Draw a house on paper with crayons. "" The most egregious in this category was the Ford sponsored Robots gallery. Lots of playing with dominos, drawing with crayons, and reading quotes from your favorite movie robots. That's it. No joke. Nothing informative at all. And I stupidly paid extra for it. I'm sure that with a good rotating exhibit, the museum would have garnered a third star from me. n nBy far the saving grace of this museum is the live demonstrations, where they do actually teach you something while wowing you with such things as exploding fireballs. n nBut honestly, the museum itself felt like a big playground for kids with ADD to run amok. I know some people are going to think ""It's a museum for kids, it's supposed to be that way. "" Well, that's true to an extent, but the museum should be both fun AND INFORMATIVE, not fun and pointless. You might as well take your kid to a Chuck E Cheese for fun and pointless.

"I noticed great reviews about this place and decided to have lunch with a friend. The d u00e9cor was okay for a Latin restaurant, the music adequate and overall the place looked clean. We were quickly served, however the food took over 20 minutes to arrive. My friend ordered pork in sauce with rice and beans arroz moro . I ordered mofongo filled with pork carne frita . Let's talk about my dish since this is where problems started for us. I thought the portion was a bit small considering this is after all a Dominican restaurant. I believe that I have seen a fair share of Latin food related restaurants living in Miami since 92 and during my youth years in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In fact, two days ago I stopped by a Dominican Restaurant in Miami and they are truly known for tasty food with generous portions. The mofongo at Punta Cana was dry with chunks of plantains still unmeshed, which is essential when preparing mofongo. There was no clear color sauce or boiled garlic water to mix with the mofongo. I cut just a piece of pork carne frita and immediately noticed an unusual odor coming out of the meat. The pork was rotten! n nI notified the waitress who in turn notified a waiter who looked like a supervisor and he stated that he was going to call the manager. The manager never arrived so the supervisor offered me to take the dish away and bring something else. I ordered just a side of rice with beans. My food was taken out of the check, however now that I think about it, the entire bill should have been complementary. Back to my poor friend who ordered pork with sauce, he immediately stopped eating. His food was not comp. n nI will not return to this place. There is common sense with operating a restaurant and a cook plays a big role on what comes out of the kitchen. He she must try what they prepare to check for flavor and cooked level, nothing sophisticated, but it must be done to keep customers in mind. If a cook won't eat it, then why should customers have to?",1

"Your experience depends on who you end up with helping you. This is the first time I've been here where a blueshirt was simply an ass. While checking in my mother in law so that she could pick up her laptop, a rather unpleasant red head had no time to bother with her questions about picking up her laptop or making an appointment to get someone to help her sync her phone. She couldn't even be bothered to look up if any appointment slots were available tomorrow as she huffed with a very dismissive and passive ""I'd have to look that up "" and walked away. After waiting a while, we finally were able to grab someone else who was very helpful and apologetic for how my mother in law was treated. He helped her rearrange to pick up the laptop make an appt to get some help tomorrow. This took about two minutes. We've had good service here before and this last gentleman was fantastic about trying to remedy the situation and apologizing for how my mother in law was dismissed, but that red head was horrible. It didn't help that she also chose to stand around near where we were a few times while we were waiting to chat casually to a few other blueshirts.

He also said the pungency of the kimchee overwhelmed the sandwich, and he couldn't taste any of the other flavors. I had the fish and chips and they were awesome.

I hate asking the waiter waitress to refill my water or coffee cup over and over again, especially when the restaurant is charging you 12.00 for a martini. On a positive side, historically the food has always been excellent. Last night after sharing a few appetizers, my wife and I shared a fresh sea bass dinner for 29.50, which was very tasty. However, for 29.50 which I thought was priced high to begin with you would think the total size of the serving would be larger then about 4 5 ounces. I believe our days of dinning at the Chop has come to a halt.",1
Let me just start by saying that I work at another jimmy johns location so I fully understand how things work here! n nA few weeks ago my boyfriend got hair in his sandwich. Gross. n nToday we tried it again and I ordered my sandwich with avocado. No avocado was on the sandwich. We called the store for a refund and the guy was a dick. Joked about giving us our money back. n nWill not return,1
"Definitely gets crowded here as it is a popular place, but there are stores of both high and med high end shops, as well as decent sales. Great restaurants and seating areas in case you get tired or hungry.really can't say anything bad here!",2
"This clothing store reminds me of Alice in Wonderland and France. Seriously, I could totally see Carla Bruni sipping some Champagne in the south of France in an Anthropologie Champagne flute wearing an Anthropologie dress and toting a matching Anthropologie clutch. THAT is the vibe you get when you walk into the store. n nI particularly love their dresses and skirts all are made out of beautiful and unique fabrics! I have a couple of them I have worn to friend's weddings and special occasions, and have always walked away with numerous compliments. Over the years, I have lost a few pounds WHOOHOO! and these are the only articles of clothing that I bothered to get altered for the simple fact that I love them so much! Great sales rack, too, with a variety of clothing and awesome discounts I am talkin 40 60 off steals . Also, a perfect place to find unique gifts for friends or cute things for your apartment. n nOnly downside their non sale items can fall in the pricey catagory.which makes you feel a little bummed that you can't go full out nuts in this store ",2
"I'm a veteran and I still had my uniform on because I just got off work and decided to get groceries on the way home from work with a friend. Bad experience, I most likely I will not shop at this fry's ever again. I was shopping with my friend picking up ingredients for dinner and one of the ingredients happens to be red wine. My friend is not 21, I even tried to explain that the wine is for cooking. I don't know anyone who buys a 5 bottle of wine for drinking. So I payed for the groceries I was able to get. I came back at a later time after i dropped of the groceries at my house which was a short 1 min drive. I returned without my friend and I was still unable to buy the wine for cooking. So I was kicked out for trying to buy an ingredient for cooking and about 8 customers with full shopping carts in line walked out after I did because they were very offended by the way they treated me.",1

"This is one of those places you always come back to regardless of how you're feeling. In fact, you may start your day somewhere else and say ""let's grab a Negroni over at la bocca my brother "". And then my brother says ""ummm duh, does a bear poop in the woods?, does a priest love little boys? Does the average American owe more on student loans than what I owe on my car payment? "". Hells yeah let's go to la bocca! Come one come all. It's chill mixed in with great service and non pretentious bartenders who want to see you good and drunk just like I want! I'm looking to my right and there's a woman with a cardinals hat yelling at the tv. I'm looking to my left and there's a guy drinking a dirty martini. It's that kind of place. By the by, the food is top fu ing notch brothers and sisters. I just had a mini orgasm in my mouth. Don't judge me",2
Two years in a row we have stayed at the TI and for a few reasons n n1. Great rates n2. Great Beds and newly remodeled rooms n3. Decent pool how ever it can get crowded as its not the largest pool complex on the strip. n4. It sits right across from the fashion show mall and there is a Tram to the Mirage! n nAs for some of the comments about the food I totally agree. The buffet is okay but the coffee shop or the deli is even less then par. Thankfully TI is positioned next to the mirage with a tram service and right across the street from the fashion show mall and the Venetian.,2
Mikes use to be the place to go about 15 years ago but has gone down a lot over the years. n nDecent price and the food is ok but not what it use to be. n nThe service was very slow and it was fairly empty went there on a Thursday night around 9pm so no reason to take so long to serve. n nWe got 2 sub and they were lukewarm and the bread wasn't really toasted. n nWish they would go back to what they use to serve,1
"I regretably went here for my birthday last night. n nOrdered the Ichi roll and got a death mayo alien roll. n nThis was the worst thing I have ever tasted. n n1 it had at least a handful of mayo blahh n n2 it had a pound of crab that looked like red white spaghetti soo gross n n3 had the texture of a raw pumpkin sliced in thin strings n n4 tasted like licking an old fish n nWe got the waitress to refund the sushi since it was un edible. nwhen she brought the bill it was not itemized and we could not figure out how it came to that much. nThe entire time our waitress was never there, never refilled our drinks. nWe finally flagged her down to get a break down of the bill. nshe came back with the same copy! nWe asked a different person who grabbed her to help us. nShe came to the table and asked ""do you have a problem with me?

"My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub par we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey.",1
"Very very interesting concept. Half the menu is on the ""healthy side "" and the other half is on the ""i don't care about eating healthy today "" side. I like, I like. n nI ordered the Ahi Tacos, which came with 3, and it was pretty good. HOWEVER.if you're not a big fan of eating raw stuff or the TEXTURE of it, considered yourself warning. nDon't get me wrong, these tacos were DELICIOUS.but I can only handle so much raw texture in my mouth After one and a half tacos, the slimy feeling became too much for me to handle. I'm not big on sushi anyways so this was like going out of my element. I was still able to finish all three of my tacos though so that's really saying how delicious they were. n nI really appreciated and enjoyed the fruit vegetable infused iced water. n nSkinnyfats is located in a weird warehouse business area. It IS easy to miss if you're not paying attention. I have still yet to try their burgers so I'll definitely be back!",2
"Great lunch spot near Costco and target. We tried the buffalo chicken as well as momma's Mac cheese, both were very good. Open and airy location and they bring your meals to you if you are dining in. n nWe will return to try more things including the four cheese melt which I'm told is excellent.",2
"I was lured into Frankie's by the promise of getting bombed on fruity drinks in tiki glasses and by the possibility of hooking up with hot rockabilly dudes. I also have a soft spot for Polynesian kitsch. This place made one of my dreams come true. n nI don't remember exactly what drink I ordered, but it was basically an oversized glass of rum mixed with the gentlest whisper of pineapple juice and it was only rated 3 skulls out of 5 in their booze potency rating system . This helped me achieve a comfortable state of inebriation quickly and for only 8. I didn't spring for the souvenir glass a fact that I now deeply regret . n nAs for the rest of my experience, allow me to break it down n n Decoration A n Music A n Customer Service C Bartenders have major 'tude, and that is if you are fortunate enough to have them condescend to acknowledge your presence. n Value B Drinks are 8 and up, but are 95 alcohol. Ah, Vegas. n Crowd C I brought the coolest people in there that night. I'm pretty sure everyone else was either a hooker or a john. n Vegas Experience B n Clearly marked bathroom facilities F Not only is it too dark inside the bar to see a foot in front of your face, but the men's and women's rooms are only loosely differentiated by ambiguous Polynesian figures on the doors.

"When I was finally able to go they always close early , I was really looking forward to it, the service was very impersonal, I felt like they didn't wanted us there, maybe they wanted to close since it was already 9pm. I saw one of the male servers continuously spank one of his female coworkers what a chauvinistic stereotype, it's ok I can say that, I am Mexican . The margaritas were good, the melted cheese was a bit weird it had a sweet taste to it, I got the spare ribs in green sauce, it was ok, it did come out pretty fast. I had better, go somewhere else, a place that stays open until at least 11.",1
"Don't go to this place! I googled for a nail salon close to another appointment I had in the area and that's how I came upon it. I called ahead for a pedicure appointment and when I got there they sat me in a broken salon chair, put water in the foot basin and then kept me waiting for 25 minutes.When I say broken chair, I mean the back was completely missing except for the frame. When I asked for a pillow she didn't come back until she was ready to start the pedicure. The remote that controls the massaging feature of the chair was also broken but all other chairs were taken so that's where I stayed for my ""relaxing "" pedicure. No apology or anything for making me wait and sitting me in a junky chair. The person who did the pedicure was in an obvious hurry and spent about 2 minutes racing through the leg massage. The tools they used to clean and cut looked dirty also, YUCK!",1
"This actually is a very large restaurant lots of seating this would be a great place for a very large group to meets and have a party when I was there there were at least three birthdays going on which is fun at first but then gets a little annoying the seating does feel a little bit like a giant cafeteria however it actually is very nice with a lot of atmosphere, lots of monitors playing sports.",2
"She's the best. First time using a professional photographer and it was ab awesome experience. The best engagement pictures, they all look like postcards! Would hire again for any special occasion.",2
We had high expectations when we got there as we had never been before. We were seated within a few minutes with no wait. The service was fine and real complaints there. I ordered a mashed potato burger with bacon and my wife had the vegetable soup. Her soup was served in a very small bowl that looked about the size of a small measuring cup. It was packed with mushrooms and no visable other vegetables. She didn't enjoy it and didn't finish it. I had the double meat mashed potato burger with bacon. The bun was huge and looked great but was too hard to even bite into. I had to take the meat off the bun and use a fork. The meat and potatoes worked week and tasted good but all in all I was let down because when you want a burger u want the whole thing and not without the bun. It was over priced and over hyped.,1
"We decided to try Good Egg once again, I was reminded why we never came back. I like the fact that they have the amount of calories next to the menu items but the food was not great. The ""whole wheat "" bread was the exact same bread that I would get in my elementary school lunch, which was a ghetto school. The egg whites that I had, had oil at the bottom of the dish and not a normal amount of oil either. I will not be coming back and do not recommend it.",1
"Took our 2 dogs for grooming here. While the groomer was nice he did an awful job. He had burnt the side of one of my dogs necks. There was burn scabs nFor weeks afterwards. I let the groomer know, he apologized and said ill use a different Gaurd next time. We gave him another chance and this time the burn marks were even worse! He had two huge scabs on both sides of his neck. My dog was shaking the entire way home. I am not one to write reviews but had to in hopes that it might safe another dog having to go through this. I can't imagine how I'm gonna take him to another groomer, he's been traumatized.",1
"Went there only once so far and we had a very good lunch. Prices aren't bad and the food and service was very good. Wanted to try the hard cider but didn't want to get a glass full, so the server brought me a sample, Ugh! Not for me. Ill just stay with the cold beer, Thank you. Will be back soon.",2
"So good! My peeps from work and I eat here like 2 or 3 times a week! Crispy garlic chicken, yellow curry, beef salad, shrimp fried rice are the bomb! ",2
"I was looking forward to a meal at the 41 but I was quite disappointed. The space is comfortable and nicely decorated. However, the food and service did not meet our expectations particularly based on the prices. The first problem we had was that the first three bottles of wine we ordered were sold out. This left us only with very high priced wine available to order. After some discussion the Maitre D' offered us one of these bottles at a lower price to compensate. This was appreciated and was a nice touch. n nThe food was unremarkable. I had the burger and fries which was fine but could have used a flavour punch. My friend had the chicken ""Kiev "" which was very disappointing. We ordered the cheese platter and the creme brule for dessert. The creme brule was very small and lacked in flavour while the cheese plate did not have a great selection. n nThe service was very slow and inattentive. We had to request water and were often looking for the server's attention to order and to pay.",1

"Whoa. Rarely.RARELY!.is there a breakfast place that I give 5 stars. It has to be as good as Matt's to get five stars from me. That is not an easy thing to do but the AZ Bread Co has been successful. This place is a jewel and should be in every major city. To start, the setup is perfect. A long counter to order your food at with pastries visible from the entrance and a large menu. They take your order and you go sit and wait for it. No stupid cluster of people in the entrance like at Scramble, so waiting for tables like at Matt's you order and you wait for your food. If the place is packed, you can sit outside. No room outside, get it to go. You can eat the stuff in your damn car if you like. They have a soda fountain with Coke and if that doesn't deserve an extra star, I don't know what does. nBut all of that stuff becomes inconsequential when you start talking food. The pecan french toast is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Their chalah bread is killer and makes the perfect french toast. The pecan topping is so rich but oh so good. I've also had the strawberry pancakes. They are not covered in a strawberry sauce like most places do it. Just pancakes, fresh cut strawberries, and some fresh whipped cream. Yum. The pancakes are perfect as well. nThere isn't anything I can find to complain about this place other than it is far away. Maybe one day they will open one downtown. Until then, I don't mind driving 15 minutes to get there.",2
"So disappointed in this event. I'm grateful that people are so fond of food trucks but I'm super unhappy that I didn't get to participate in the way that I wanted. n nThe traffic was horrible. Did they not cap the ticket sales? For 25 food trucks, there were 13,000 people? That's 520 people per truck no wonder it took several hours for people to wait in line and get food! No normal restaurant can serve that many people. n nPlanning was awful, parking was awful. Charging for parking, ticket entry, AND food? Wow. n nDear Salt River Fields, next time CAP THE TICKET SALES maybe a few thousand at most. Charge more if you have to clearly people are interested . Invite more food trucks!",1
"What a great little barber shop! I've been meaning to come down, and finally found the time. Got me a great haircut, neck shave and head massage all for under 20! Each cutting station has it's own personal TV, I was able to watch some football while getting a cut. It's truly a nice barbershop, granite counter tops and the old school barber shop chairs. This is what's it's all about, small local businesses! Good work Gentleman Joe's!",2
"I would give these folks 5 stars if they gave better customer service. I'm from New Haven and while this pizza wouldn't make it there, its very decent. I like what they do but there is an air of cockiness that sorta turns me off. nWe grew up with going out for pizza every Friday night. nI take my daughter her 1 2x a month and occasionally my Husband will agree to dinner here but he thinks the prices are too high for the amount of toppings they put on. nOverall, I wouldn't order for take out, casue it doesn't arrive when promised or warm but after the movies or for a real pizzeria feel, its good. nIf they would just appreciate your business and look u in the eye, that would win me over and the teens that work there could use some coaching about gratitude, respect and helpfulness nWe would be weekly patrons if they could correct those issues.",2
"Honestly the food is great, although their single burger prices makes one have to buy a meal 5 for a burger . I enjoyed the food better than Mickey D's I wish there was one in the Chicagoland area",2
If you connect in Charlotte expect constant delays! Every time I connect through to Dulles I experience planes with mechanical delays,1
"We have been to Lidia's twice now, and have received delicious food and excellent service both times. We have only been on weeknights, and with reservations, however, so I'm not at all discrediting the reviews that discussed poor service on weekend nights and or without reservations. n nThe pasta trio special was good when I had it, but my favorite dish is the gnocchi with duck ragu. I also loved my husband's wild boar ravioli. Skip the overpriced wine and order one of the house sodas instead. The ginger cranberry is fabulous! We also love love love the frico and burrata appetizers. The frico is large and rich enough that it's really enough for two people, but the appetizers are yummy, so everyone might as well get their own and bring home whatever they can't finish. n nNote to parents of babies, this restaurant is very family friendly, in our experience. We loved bringing our infant daughter here and were pleased that the restaurant offers slings for carseats for the smaller babies as well as highchairs for babies who are of sitting up age many places don't have the slings . The lady's room and its changing station were very clean. The staff often stopped to smile back at the baby when she was smiling at them, and our waiter asked if we needed anything for her. Not necessary, but very nice, and appreciated. n nThey have valet parking, but we just park about a block away and walk, since we sometimes enjoy walking further down the strip district, anyway.",2
"The Wandering Horse Buffet is a very good non Vegas buffet. We came here on a Friday night. On weekends, starting Friday nights, the price of the buffet is 26.95. For children between 5 12, the price of the buffet is 14. The food is good for a casino buffet not located in Vegas. n nThe food is separated by sections. Starting from the far left as you walk in is the seafood station. The seafood consists of Alaskan King crab legs, Lobster claws, mussels, and clams with a pesto sauce. Most of the seafood was pretty good. They have a carving station. On the night that we were there, they had a leg of lamb, beef wellington, and a pork roast. The leg of lamb was dry. The wellington was soggy, but, the meat was pretty good. The pork looked ugly, but, it actually had a good smoky taste to it. They had a grilling station where they cooked Kobe sirloin steaks and vegetables. The Mexican and Asian station didn't look good, so I skipped both of these. They also had a salad bar, different cheeses and sliced meats. None of which I tried. But, it did look good. n nFor dessert, they had a dessert station with about 10 different flavored gelatos. They also make crepes and bananas foster. All manned by an impatient Chinese Mandarin woman. She must've been lonely because she started speaking to me in Chinese. It wasn't until I started conversing with her that her impatient attitude changed. n nOur waitress was pretty good. She did a pretty good job clearing our plates, and kept our cups filled. The only interesting thing all night were the fighters that came in here to eat. There were going to have some kind of tournament in the hotel. Some of them looked pretty rough. n nOverall, it was a good experience with good food and good service. Definitely would be back if we went to Scottsdale again.",2
"I was trying to figure out why there are such different reviews for this place. I was thinking that the bad reviews were from people who were used to corporate chains and processed foods. I really got that wrong. nIf you are expecting Italy or Naples style food, you too will be greatly let down as I was. I had several texts to warn me when I checked in here for dinner. I should have listened. nPasta was overcooked. Floating in a butter sauce, literally. So much poor quality cheese on everything. Pizza was like frozen style maybe before it was frozen. Smothered in greasy cheese on a boring crust. nWe had 2 dinners and 2 pizzas. We ate about 1 3 and felt sick from the heavy, cheesy, oily, buttery and greasy food. I may have to have a cholesterol medication after this. Even my dinner salad had about a cup of cheese pellets on top of it. I've not seen mozzarella in this form before. What is going on here? Maybe I would have thought this was good when I was in my teens. I think that this place has a lot going for it, but not it's food.",1
"Stopped in tonight to kill some time and grab a light bite during happy hours. Jammie, our barmaid couldn't seem to get it right on more than one account. My wife and I had trouble putting cash in the poker machines. Jammie helped get the two 20 bills in the machines that we played. We ordered our drinks and were charged 10 bucks while playing. I asked if they comp'd drinks and she said yes, but you have to play 10 to qualify. HUH? We just played 40 We ordered Nachos and were brought Irish Nachos french fries w bacon and other crap on it . Oops, my mistake again, I guess! nNo apology, no comp, NO WAY will we return. Bummer.",1

"The theme and decor from outside is what lured us in. It looked like a killer place! But once we stepped in, I was not impressed. n n 9 for HALF a bowl of guacamole the other half are chips camouflaged by the top guac. Come on! n n Can't bring in outside drinks? Every other place would allow it. We had to toss them before coming in. n n Slow service for a strip bar.and it wasn't even crowded! n nNext time I'll probably just stick with Hardrock or something safer. Hopefully Diablo's has stepped up their game!",1
"We were excited to stay at the golden nugget because of all of the reviews on help. However, we were very disappointed. Our stay started when half our party arrived and the system had crashed. The front desk told them they had no reservations saved from this and they were able to check them in because they were there other reservations could not be held. Thankfully they allowed them to check us into our room, because when we did arrive the hotel was booked and we would not have been given a room. Prior to our trip we called twice to request rooms on the same floor and this did not happen one on 11 and the other on the 19th . They did tell us we could switch rooms in the AM and to call down and we could move. We called down in the AM and the front desk told us the room was empty and needed cleaning but would check us into the room and when we came back into the hotel to pick up keys. We did exactly that and there was no record of our new room and there were no open rooms on the 11th floor. They thankfully never checked us out of our 19th floor room. n nAlso, wifi was 13 a day and coffee, a bottle of Figi water for 7 and 4 Kcups for 10. What a rip! n nNeedless to say the staff just didn't seem happy to be there or want to help the guests. I'm SURE there are nicer and better places to stay in Vegas and even if it was a good deal for the hotel it is worth a little more money to stay somewhere else!",1
"The ice cream is just not that good.it's too syrupy sweet or something. I can't quite put my finger on it, but both times I have had it just wasn't right. It took way too long for them to get our orders mixed, etc. They were really nice YOUNG kids working behind the counter though so I can't be too harsh. They did seem to jump around from our group to the ones behind us a few times so I as the dad our group was just left standing there for quite a while waiting there for them to finish up with people behind us line. This makes no sense to me, but whatever. Someone must like Cold Stone because they are a franchise with lots of locations, but for me I would much rather mix in candy bars and cookies with my own ice cream at home for a fraction of the price and treat myself to frozen yogurt instead.",1
"lets just say the only good thing about this place was that there waitresses were pretty. n nas the review below me stated the all you can eat is pretty much the only good thing about this place. you can order only FULL rolls. you can't order half rolls so you cant even get a taste of everything on the menu. also you are only allowed ONE desert so there goes desert selection also. service was okay, but at times pretty slow. as i said the best thing about this place was the waitresses. n nif your up for the trip theres a nice little sushi place called XTREME SUSHI in southern highlands. much more better.",1
"Great illusion show at the Riviera Starlite Room. Good venue, strong act, VERY FUNNY and enjoyable. Would definitely return to the Riviera and recommend Jan Rouven to others.",2
Only had a take out. Shrimp dish and scallops dish. Shared for two people. Rice was very good and so were the two entree's. I would try again. I live in SC.,2
Never been to Oregano's before tonight. I had the Vino Bambino salad and The Clark Street meat pizza. Both were bomb! Won't give 5 stars b c the waitress was a little flighty lol but all in all good experience with Oregano's. Waaaaay better than Spinato's as far as I'm concerned,2
"Quite a crappy place! Bad lunch. I had the Reuben sandwich which was a specialty of the day. This arrived with cold fries. The Reuben was built with sauerkraut right out of the jar and corned beef that came from a processed cold cut package. Not even the shittiest Korean deli makes a sandwich this awful. n nThere is something called ""Parke's Law "" that states upon arrival, if you look around the restaurant and evaluate the open and available tables, you will be taken to the least desirable table. I have eaten at BlackThorne twice and twice Parke's Law has been in effect. n nSkip the dining experience that is known as . BlackThorne!",1
"Went in here Sunday afternoon to have a beer while I finished Tolstoy's Hadji Murad, and couldn't decide between the four IPAs on tap so the bartender offered me a shot of each to try. I settled on the Fresh Squeezed from Deschutes and nursed it for almost two hours as I read. The staff didn't make me feel rushed to pay and leave, which was nice, so I stopped back on Monday for a two dollar draft with a friend who had a prosciutto panini which looked tasty and was nicely presented with a side salad with baby greens and arugula. I will be coming back. Four stars because it's a tad expensive.",2
"Review from Aug 2012 No advance warning that the ""spa "" was closed. We were diverted to the 8th floor to a stripped down hotel room. No lockers, no sauna, no hot tub. Crappy view. And for our inconvenience, a mere 20 discount. I can't comment on the massage because we walked out.",1
"A cosy little coffee shop with eclectic decor. The coffee is decent, the vibe is relaxed, they have a nice little terrace out back, what more to ask for? Oh and they have interesting mugs. Its the details like this that make me really enjoy a place. I like it best for sitting out on the back terrace, enjoying a little sun, drinking a beverage. It's as close to a back yard as I'm getting for the moment. n nI find service is hit or miss depending on who is working the counter. Sometimes its super friendly, sometimes a little dry. No matter, the coffee and the vibe are why I choose to stop in.",2
"These guys are ripoff artists. Every time you come in there, they'll recommend new brakes, new tires and an alignment unless it's under warranty, then they'll find reasons not to honor the warranty . n nThey told my wife that she had torn engine mounts, and that it would be an 850 repair. Took the vehicle to Advanced Auto Center, and the technician showed me that none of the mounts were torn. I had some tires with 45,000 mile warranties that needed to be replaced after 20,000 miles, but they wouldn't honor the warranty.",1
"Jessica provides an awesome experience. When you first arrive you are greeted with a smile and a glass of wine. She lines up a nice variety of restaurants and they were all ready for us upon our arrival. The food at each of the restauraunts was delicious, we actually went back downtown the following night and had appetizers at one of them. n nAlong the way she provides a bit of history regarding the restaurant. In addition as you are making your way between the various restaurants she provides some history of the buildings you pass by. We had a number of locals on our tour so she provided some information of various festivities which occur downtown throughout the year.",2
"Who goes to BRGR and orders the vegetarian burger? I do and it was pretty good, full of Middle Eastern flavors without being a lentil filled cliche. That leads me to believe that when I go back and order the real deal, whether it's beef or bison, it will be darn tasty. The onion rings were terrific, maybe the best I've had, and worth a star on their own. n nThe minuses? Parking was a pain though they do have valet , my husband's Shrooms burger was overwhelmed by it's mustard aioli, and my veggie burger completely fell apart after resting for a moment in the basket. And, they were out of 8 or 9 of the beers on their menu, so it took 2 or 3 tries to order a drink. But we'd go back BRGR is full of potential, and I still haven't had a spiked shake.",2
"I have had several wonderful experiences with SADU. I had two piercings done here, and my results have been flawless. I echo the reviewers who tout the sensational staff who offer expert advice and aesthetic suggestions. These guys and gals really know their stuff. Equipment is always sanitized, and Corinna makes sure to explain each step of the process, from measuring to marking to piercing, which eases my nervousness about needles and pointy things. n nSADU came highly recommended from a friend, and it's my first recommendation to everyone who mentions wanting body cartilage piercing. n nMy only qualm is that occasionally, those staffing the counter can be somewhat indifferent to customer service and helping those who aren't part of the piercing culture. However, their selection of bones, rings, studs etc. exceeds all expectations. n nIf you're expecting a Claire's style piercing experience, please do yourself a favor and leave the flower power at home. n nAll in all, it's the only place to go for piercing. Tell them the fainting girl sent you! ",2
"We've been to Firefly on Paradise Rd. and since we happened to be in this part of Vegas, we decided to try it out. n nThis location is much bigger and a bit more trendy compared to the Paradise Rd. location however, that's not necessarily a good thing. n nThe menu offerings are exactly the same as the other Firefly location. This time around the s o of course had to order the Bacon Wrapped Dates, which are always a hit. We also ordered the Ham Cheese Croquettes which were okay, kind of reminded of a Fried Cheese Stick. I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms and totally forgot I ordered that the last time and didn't like it much, thankfully I did remember to ask for lemon to squeeze over it, which in fact did help tremendously. Not sure why but, I ordered their Fried Calamari, which was really basic but wow, it was greasy. You know that lethargic feeling you get after eating greasy food.thanks Calamari! n nThe service.oh boy, this is where they fail and why they lost so many stars from me. n nOur server who I won't call out, was really blah. When he introduced himself, he didn't go the extra mile about talking about Happy Hour, any specials, etc. he just simply asked what we'd like to drink. To sum it up, we saw him four times first to introduce himself, second to take our order and last to bring the check and return the change. I did have to roll my eyes when he asked, ""Any change needed? "" Eff yeah dude! However, credit is due to the food runners and bussers, they were the ones that provided us spectacular service. I wish we could've given them the tip instead of our server. n nOverall, nice location but we won't be back, we'd rather go to Paradise Rd. instead.",1
. and now it's appropriately closed.,1
"Great fresh juice! Prices seem steep at first glance but fruit is expensive. Like the saying goes, ""Pay the farm now, or pay the pharm later. "" ""You have to try new food cause it might taste good. "" Daniel Tiger",2
"definitely love the food here. I've only been here twice, but each time the food has been wonderful and the service fast and friendly. nI would recommend the machaca, carnitas and jen red quesadilla sweet and sour . n nI do like how the food comes in a tinfoil container, so if I want to get my food to go all I need is a lid and it's ready for carry out. n nMy one complaint is there is no ice tea. They do have Lipton tea from the fountain, but that's not tea, I don't know what that swill is. If only they would get some fresh brewed tea, this place would get five stars.",2
"It's just an upgraded version of Old Country Buffet. A buffet for typical American food that senior citizens would appreciate and love. I personally thought the Mac n cheese, meat, and Americanized Chinese food was unappetizing. This place is for old and retired folks who are content with pasta type foods not a place for sushi lovers, and high end food lovers.",1
Great tasty food at reasonable prices nTry the chicken Swarma much delicious nTapas are fantastic!,2
"Gross. n nThe plates were pretty gross. It seems like they just wipe off the top of the plates before they put them back. The bottom of the plates seemed dirty. Why do the bottom of the plates matter? Think about this when the plates are stacked, what are the eating surfaces of the plates in contact with? n nThe food was very disappointing. n nI didn't get sick, though. That's always nice.",1
"Go first next door to 7 11 and get a Wild Cherry Slurpee. Then , when you eat the hot salsa , you have a cooling effect from the Slurpee. n nWe had a Tlayuda with chicken big enough to split and a Memelita with Carne Asada, a carne asada taco and al pastor taco. We asked about a 100 chicharron memelita and owner said ""sure, we can put anything you want. "" n nThe 3 salsas everyone mention are all awesome, We bought some green salsa to go and would have gotten the red as well but they did not have enough as they needed to make a fresh batch. I take this as a good sign of fresh food. Just an excuse to go back We liked the jalapenos and onion they served, quite lovely and tasty. Even my friend who has a hesitation for hot stuff liked them. n nWe also forgot to order the papa y chorizo fritter thangies damn, another excuse to go back. n nQuite a haul from Goodyear but I have a plan. Go there for lunch, then take Glendale west to Ranch Market, get some supplies there Pollo Asada , then go farther west to La Purisima for some fresh pastries and TORTILLAS!. n nThis is my nomnom tour",2
"Had dinner here one night and I would probably rate it has a 2.5. They claim to have the best fish and chips in town so my bf ordered them and he was not overly impressed with them at all. The fish looked like they were drowning in batter and the fries were cold and not very good. Our server was ok, not overly friendly and not overly rude either. n nI probably do not have to come back to this place. If I want a pub feel I will probably head to the George and Dragon, at least there they have blackberry crumble!",1
"My hubby and I stopped here yesterday for a late lunch. The place was recommended by the Direct TV tech that had done some repairs at our house. Boy were we ever disappointed! My husband ordered the pork tacos and had requested flour tortillas but they came out with corn. After calling our waiter over, we had asked him to change the tortillas to flour as we had originally requested. He said not problem and within a few minutes, they were back on the table. That being said, my husband said the pork was dry and lacked flavoring. I had ordered the cane asada which came out very dry some of the meat was actually curled up and crisped and really lacking in flavor. The beans and rice were just so, so. Would not recommend although the staff was very friendly and helpful. We will not be returning.",1
I was hoping that this place would surprise me as it is the only location I have seen in Vegas that pulls their own noodles. Coming from souther CA and growing up with Noodle House in Rowland Heights that pulled their own noodles too I was expecting a lot more than what we got. n nThe first tip that we should have left and not eaten there was the lack of big table for huge parties. There were two on opposite ends of the restaurant that would seat 10 people at each table. The decor was ultra modern that came out of a magazine but that didn't help the food. n nWe ordered two dishes as we were eat an early dinner. We had the pork and shrimp won tons with pulled noodles and the general tsao's chicken. My biggest complaint was the food was BLAND! The broth that was with the noodles had no flavor. n nThe chicken was bland as well. Though I was hoping it would be more like a pepper sauce the dish was more of a peking style but was not sweet like I'm used to. Overall I would not come back it was 45 for two dishes and water.,1
"This place would be fun during a sports game because they have SOOO many TVs. I went during a late afternoon and I wasn't really impressed. I've heard mixed reviews and I understand why. The atmosphere is cool like I said, a ton of TVs and a good amount of tables inside and out but the staff wasn't memorable and neither was the food. I went during happy hour but wasn't given a happy hour menu and when I asked the bar staff, they looked at each other and asked ""wait .what drinks food is on happy hour? "" as if they didn't know themselves. Really? You don't know your own happy hour? That's strange. I probably won't be back but it would be a good place to watch a game",1
"Visited Juan's after reading the numerous complementary reviews. Unfortunately, our experience did not come close to that of more enthusiastic reviewers. The service left something to be desired, primarily because we had to wait over thirty minutes for our food to arrive, even though the restaurant was not packed until after we received our food. Additionally, I was not impressed by the tamale on my plate and found the cheese enchilada cold. My husband was also less than impressed by his chile relleno, but found it more edible than my food. Overall, we have had much better Mexican food at numerous other establishments in the Phoenix area and will not be returning.",1
"I am disappointed after tonight. n nWe were seated quickly, the place was not busy. n nMy guy asks what kinds of Tequila they have he hasn't been here and the waitress snottily says, n n ""We're a Mexican restaurant, reallyyyyy.? "" n nRUDE. You couldn't have told him a few of your best sellers, or any recommendations? n nOur waitress took our alcoholic drink order, but didn't come back with any waters. We were then approached by 2 separate servers trying to take our drink food order. n nA few weeks ago, I was here with a girlfriend DEC 27,2013 . Their fresh fish tacos are done with Tilapia gross to me and last time I was able to switch it out with their Mahi. n nBy the time our waitress got us our drinks from the bar, we had gotten our waters. We asked our original waitress for lemon slices when she was ready for our food order. n nI asked for the fish tacos, with the Mahi. She said that there might be a up charge there wasn't last time but I told her that was fine. I didn't recall what my guy had, but it was a combination plate with floutas, a Chile rellaneno I know I am completely butchering this spelling wise, sorry and a chimmechanga. n nAfter taking our orders, and our menus, the waitress comes from the back and tells me that her ""manager said no to the Mahi. "" I grabbed another menu and ordered the Mesquite chicken tacos. n nStill no lemon wedges. She walks around the restaurant. We ask another waiter, who Finishes cleaning a few tables, putting dishes away, and still gets us our lemons before she does. Ugh. n nOur food comes, and it's good. I prefer their kickin chicken tacos, but those were discontinued, I guess. We asked for some sour cream, which they will charge you 1.30 for. Annoying, but whatever. n nWhile we were eating, we saw the manager walking around, and usually, a manager will ALWAYS at least greet us and ask how our food was. This guy didn't. Our waitress had no problem just kind of yanking our plates out of the way. It must have been a bad night for her. n nMeh. It makes me sad to write this review. Food was good, but service and management are not on the same length.",1
"WOWZER. Searching for a late night place that offers more than just a bar menu? I was, and my blackberry search led me here. Everything was fantastic during my first visit. The service, the food and the overall environment. It was so great that I went back within a week or two. The 2nd visit was just as phenom as the first, so I figured it was worthy of getting online to write a stellar review. The apps, the main courses, the sushi, the drinks.We've ordered from every section and have not been disappointed once. Better yet, we've been WOWED each time. Whoever thought of this is a genius. There is NO other restaurant in Charlotte that is anything like it. Hip. Delicious. Clever. It's like Charlie Sheen. WINNING.",2
"I would agree with other reviewers who use the words deceptive, scamming, money hungry agressiveness tactics they use. Be careful when coming here. My group was also promised a ride home but that never happened. The promoter kept saying later times but we got the idea, and took a taxi back.",1
I was leaving the store and one of the workers said I couldn't be let out of the left side doors coming from the checkout lanes. So no worries I walked to the other side doors to find out that they where locked too. Now I was pissed because I have to go back wait for someone to notice me so I can get let out. With two bags and a gallon of milk. Finally when I get noticed I ask if I can please go out the other doors because it is a little bit closer to my car because I was parked at Lane Bryant I get the cold shoulder and told to have a nice day. FU!,1
"I must say, that after Eddie Chans left, I had a large, gaping hole in my heart. In hopes that another Asian restaurant would take its place, I was initially disappointed to see another ""pizza "" place go in. you know, with ZPizza in the SAME shopping center . But, I really did love the feel of this place, and I came hungry, which was a plus. We ordered the drunk bread appetizer, which, in my personal opinion, was the best thing I ate. Wine, cheese, and bread. if it had chocolate somewhere, it would be a fusion of all my greatest loves. We also ordered the beef carpaccio. This dish left much to be desired. I am not afraid of carpaccio. give it to me nice and raw. their carpaccio was well seasoned, but, in my opinion, was a bit overcooked. I had the veggie pizza, and it was very good. Veggies were flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the pizza was good. Good, not GREAT I am partial to Sauce . Dessert was the berry calzone and I was blown away. Big enough to share, and not too sweet, with nutella instead of chocolate. I loved it. I am however, bummed that I just had a glass of wine here, now reading other reviews about their stellar cocktails. My favorite thing was the feel of this place. I love Postino Wine Bar in Phoenix, but its such a hike, and Local really has that feel. Very neighborhood, great bar, good apps. Service is really good, too. They aren't all over you, and I came with people who I don't often see, so we chat a lot, and he didn't make us feel rushed, which was really nice. I recommend it, especially if you are a local in Grayhawk or Desert Ridge.",2
"I have honestly never, EVER been treated so poorly at a restaurant before. It must be nice to be Benjie M., who gave the place 5 stars and said Tina was sweet and friendly, because to me, Tina was one of the rudest people I've ever met. I had a Groupon, and so my boyfriend and I went in February on a Saturday night. We got there about 7 30. When we walked in the door, Tina was socializing with friends. When she saw us, she rolled her eyes and said, ""ARE YOU SERIOUS?! We closed like an HOUR AGO. "" Confused, I pointed out that their sign says that the last seating is at 8, and it was only 7 30. She told me that she didn't care and she'd decided to close early. We complained that the Groupon we had expired soon, and we wouldn't be able to come back before the expiration date. Tina sneeringly said, ""Well didn't you see the SIGN? "" as she pointed out a small, hand written sign that all Groupons would be extended until March 28th. Disappointed, hungry, and a bit shaken by being spoken to so rudely, we left. n nLast night, we decided to come back and use that Groupon. We even made sure to get there nice and early, at 6. They were open, and we were seated. However, when we mentioned the Groupon this time, Tina said, ""Oh that expired a long time ago. "" I reminded her of the sign she had had up saying that the Groupons would be extended until March 28th. She proceeded to give us a rambling, condescending lecture, basically amounting to the fact that she changed her mind, and refused to honor it. n nNeedless to say, I really don't appreciate being treated like trash, and will never be coming back here again. If you want Ethiopian food, I'd recommend the Blue Nile Cafe in Tempe. Better menu selection, delicious food, pleasant staff, and comparable prices.",1
"Walked in and sat at the bar. There seemed to be an abundance of staff standing around, including one girl examining a tattoo she had on her side. Anyway, we waited for about a minute. No one even glanced in our direction, so needless to say, we did not receive any service. We walked out and went directly next door to Whiskey Row. Not surprised Hi Fi was nearly empty while the other surrounding bars had full patios. Step up your customer service game, Hi Fi. It was sad and awful.",1
"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences. n nOn the first trip, I went to try their at that time raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it. n nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben. n nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment. n nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops. n nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber basic. Three soups mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out , basic iceberg lettuce mix very probably out of a bag , a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal. n nThe mind blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style.which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. n nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. n nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green parsley? , and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets. n nThank goodness for the basic salad bar. n nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag. n nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers.about baseball.and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh. n nThird base? Nah.why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie.they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds. n nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.",1
As sports bars go it's an ok place. Service was fine. Food was not up to par with what I expected. The wings were rather small but dry and overcooked with decent sauce. The burger was salty on 1 end so as I could not finish it. Tried the pizza which was way small and way over priced and tasted like a frozen pizza. n nOverall ok for drinks but wont return for food.,1
"As long as 27 Tattoo is open, I will not get a tattoo anywhere else.",2
It was an ok joint. Servers was polite and professional. The burger was alright. I love the truffle fries and spicy edamame.,1
"Absolutely wonderful experience. Everything about this place really exceeded my expectations. n nThe ambiance, the food, the service, the staff. n nAll the waiters seem to know the menu upside down which is extremely important . They make wonderful recommendations and are very friendly. n nI recommend the Yellowtail Sashimi as an appetizer, the salmon crunchy roll, and the horchata flan. We had a few other things, but everything is seasonal so they might not be on the menu. n nOverall, great restaurant.",2
"We ordered almost every appetizer and they were all delicious, I loved the jalapeno poppers and cheese curds. Our server was AMAZING! We were a group of seven and she was great, she would bring us things before we even had to ask and got all of our drink food orders perfectly, very attentive. I will be returning.",2
Service kinda sucks and the servers are bitchy.,1
"Nothing I can say that hasn't been said yet this place is unreal! I'm a flight attendant and came here on a layover, instead of the usual shopping on the strip and gambling. Spent about 25.00 and killed almost 3 hours, and I would have stayed longer if I didn't have to take the bus about 45min 1hr by bus, from the strip . n nIt's not just rows and rows of old school and newer pinball machines, but also some sweet rare, vintage, throwback games i.e., a shuffleboard style bowling game, a baseball game but pinball twist, this tiny hunting style game complete with rifles , and also some stuff featured on Pawn Stars! n nOne of the coolest things is how most of the older games have an index card attached and contains trivia regarding that particular game how it was procured, if it's a super rare find, popularity of the game during its time, etc. It's definitely like a museum, except you can touch everything, and it's way more fun! n nOne of the guys working there approached me while I was KILLING IT on the Mario Andretti Racing Pinball machine and was super friendly, and I had to spread the word! n nDon't worry about bringing change there's change machines. nThere's also restrooms.",2
"Flancer's is amazing. The staff are amazing and the food is amazing. I can't think of a better place to go to for lunch almost every Saturday! O n nTheir sandwiches are a must have! I am a bit hooked on their prickly pear chicken sandwich, which I order.every. single. time! The chicken itself is delicious, it has a slight sweetness to it from the prickly pear marinade. Don't get me started on their fresh baked bread! I try to eat healthier when we go out and I TRY to order the prickly pear chicken SALAD no bread but I cannot resist the bread! P.S. You can also get a free loaf of their bread if you check in there on foursquare O I have also tried bites of many other sandwiches which my bf orders they are ALL so good. They have amazing soups as well they taste homemade and delicious! n nThe staff are all so friendly, they are very knowledgeable of the menu and honest. They are another reason that brings me back here, nothing beats friendly service. The restaurant itself is very small but comfortable and lots of record albums covers on the wall to entertain you ",2
The food here was great but it took so long that I forgot what I ordered. I think our waiter forgot about our table my brother ordered a beer an hour later it was on the bill but still hadn't showed up and our water occasionally got refilled. Like I said horrible half rude service but great food,1
"Very entertaining, but the line that forms to get in is rather long. All the acts were pretty great, especially Wally with his punchlines and Russ, whose act kept me laughing for a long time. The show also featured Melinda the magician, which was pretty good as well. I wish the stage was bigger though. Overall, it was a good show for the discounted price the full price is probably asking a bit too much.",2
"Marielle said it all. Very unprofessional. Beware the owner, he will never respond to phone calls or text messages due to prior engagements. Satisfied with their previous maid service, but unsatisfied with their business.",1
Busters Well it's a place where I've been to a handful of times It sits by a lake which is nice. It's good for intimate parties. So we went there today with my family for lunch play picnic since it was super hot for a picnic we decided on busters so we could eat on the patio by the lake and the experience was soooo disappointing. So we waited over 15 minutes for a host or hostess. So when my BF walked to ask the woman working in the bar area that we among others are and had been waiting. she was totally rude and sarcastic. When he said wed been. Waiting over 15 min she laughed. He was upset that he was treated so poorly We ended up leaving. Just from the staff not knowing how to treat customers. My bf introduced me to the place for a quiet lunches years ago and I doubt either of us will ever go back. Pretty upsetting and the funny thing is the hostess still never came and there were a lot of guests in our same situation waiting to see a host or hostess. Hopefully this review will let the employees no that when they are working its their job to represent the co. Otherwise they'll lose customers. Thumbs down on service and attitude. Too bad ,1
"Wow lousy parking conditions for a start. Greeted promptly and seated promptly. That is what the 2 stars are for. After that, downhill fast waiter brought wrong wine but promptly corrected it. Hubby ordered tortellini meh at best spinach salad for the girl bland and so dry asked for extra warm bacon dressing don't think there was even any dressing on it to begin with added dressing that appeared to be 99 oil no bacon flavor and no bacon on salad even though menu stated it was supposed to. Huge no no they need to shorten the stems of the spinach or remove them all together. No one eats stems! Anyway will probably not return as dinner left a huge void in flavor and atmosphere.",1
"My 13 year old son broke with leg two months ago and since has been non weight bearing. As a result, even with physical therapy 3 x week, he is having a difficult time bending his leg back to a normal position. Last week he was seen by Dr. Hunt as a first time chiropractic patient. Dr. Hunt quickly put my son and his anxiety at ease. He fully explained each step of the process prior to the adjustment. After the adjustment Dr. Hunt took a few minutes longer to have a very heart felt yet concerning talk about my son consciously working toward straightening his leg it was good for him to hear it from somebody other than ""nagging "" mom . In addition, while waiting in the lobby I was extremely impressed with the family feel environment and the way the staff acknowledged coming and going patients. Our first experience exceeded expectations and we look forward to future treatments with Hunt Family Chiropractic!",2

"Is it just me or do other people not 'get' this place? n nYes, its ""alternative "" and ""artsy "" and various other pretensious words but once you get down to it, frankly its just a bit of a crap cafe thats run by volunteers. Dont get me wrong, I like the idea of a volunteer ran cafe but this really isnt how I would have imagained it if I am honest. n nMore over, the type of people who come here are the 'Yah's' from Pollock halls who think they have to ""escape daddy's money "" but really if he cut them off they would fail miserably. Grrrr. n nI'm really not a fan of this place its a good idea, but in practice its a bit rubbish.",1
"Let's start off by saying that this place has horrible service and I was cursed at twice by the delivery drivers in two separate orders. n nSo I placed an order with them online for two deluxe calzones and it arrived 45 minutes late. Understandably, the restaurant can be short staffed on a Sunday night but not only was the delivery late, the delivery man addressed me very rudely and cursed me out. This was inexcusable behavior and bore a bad name for the restaurant. I called the restaurant's night manager who gave me nothing more than a snappy apology. n nThe calzones themselves were decently sized and filled with good oily ingredients but the crust was too thick for my liking. n nI will remember to not tip the driver beforehand next time, IF I will even consider ordering from such an establishment. n n Update nI gave them another try a year later and when I undertipped the driver 10 on a 7 delivery he later sent me a very rude text message calling me an ""ignorant a "" and finished it off with ""don't order food anymore a hole "" n nOk, I'll take your advice. You just lost my business and everyone in my apartment after I told them this story.",1
"My oh my! If only you knew the drama and the stress that us girls went through in order to choose which hotel we'd stay at in Vegas on our girls trip. We went from a slew of hotels to stay at. our heart was set on the Venetian because a It's a 5 star hotel and b It's sleek and sexy! Normally I stay at the Bellagio and my friend stays at the Wynn so we're used to NICE FANCY hotels. in the end we chose the Venetian and the Palazzo suite for our stay. 1400 square feet of ballin! Or so it looked like from the picture. n nArrived on Friday at 11 30AM to check in. my friend hadn't arrived yet so even though check in isn't until 3PM I tried anyway. LONG line to check in. LOOOOONG line! An employee saw me enter the velvet ropes and asked if I was checking in and I said yes. he said that if I didn't mind going up the elevator that was no wait to check in upstairs. score! So I went up stairs to check in. my room wasn't ready and I requested a couch with a pull out sofa sleeper but I was told that there were no rooms available with the pull out sleeper. but that if one was available Saturday they could switch our rooms. a lot of trouble if you ask me to switch rooms so I asked about a roll away bed and they said normally it's 35 day but they would give me one for free since no sofa sleeper was available. Brownie points for them! They said they would call me as soon as the room was ready but that they would hold my bags for me. easy enough. We went shopping! n nI got a call around 2PM that the room was ready. My friend arrived at almost 4 30PM so we checked in thereafter. Got our keys and headed up to our suite. arrived at the END of a VERY LONG HALLWAY and was ready to see our pimpin suite. opened the doors and. n nwas extremely disappointed. BEYOND disappointed! Um was this the same room as the pictures?!?!?!? Cuz it sure didn't look like it. The rugs were worn and dirty. There was no L shaped couch. Just a dirty yellow ""love seat "" which didn't look very lovey. Two small chairs and a small table in the living room. The living room looked. empty. Pathetic. Lonely. Everything looked. OLD. The bathroom was nice so I'll give it that. But that's about it. We called the front desk about not having an L shaped couch which I was told we'd get when I checked in. he stated it only comes with a ""love seat "" and I mentioned it was fraying, dirty, and old and that it wasn't lovey or lovely at all and all he did was apologize. My friend and I were. confused. Debating on what to do. We were supposed to meet up with 2 other friends to go to the Wynn Buffet for dinner so we decided to go do dinner and talk about it. Talking was short. We hated the room and felt cheated! So after dinner we went back to the front desk, IN PERSON, no phone calls. n nWe inquired about having a room that was ""more 5 star quality "" and the nice gentleman helping us started to show us bigger suites in his book. we explained it wasn't the SIZE of the suite that was the problem. hell we had 1400 square feet which is practically a house!. it was what was IN the suite that LACKED 5 stars! We listed everything and then he did some researching. and he showed us a different suite at the newer Palazzo connected to the Venetian and asked us if we'd consider moving there. and we agreed. He even mentioned that our suite has yet to be renovated and that it is older but that they are renovating next year. helllooooo FALSE ADVERTISING! The pics look NOTHING like the room itself. Ughh it was GROSS! n nBellman took all our stuff to our new suite in the Palazzo. and it was a BOMB ASS SUITE! I'll write a review under Palazzo for that one . but Venetian, you FAIL, an absolute EPIC FAIL. and never ever ever ever again will I even CONSIDER staying with you. lesson learned for me and my friend. BELLAGIO AND WYNN all the way! n nSide note lots of great shopping, TAO is an awesome club!. and the gondola ride outside is super cute!",1
"This is based on the casino only as I've never stayed the night. This casino is obviously full of rich history and good memories of ""bugsy "". But if you know anything about him you know he hated that nickname. n nI went recently to check out the gardens in the back of the casino which are gorgeous. . with animals and koi and all kinds of fish and actual flamingos, along w the the bugsy memorial. I've lived here and been here a few times but never made the time to go out there. Next time I go I'll be able to see all of it as the sun went down by the time we got there. n nThe casino is connected to Margaritaville which has very overpriced food and drinks and a shop connected, of which I can live without a 30 tee that looks like it cost 2 to make. n nENTERTAINMENT On my birthday we came here to watch George Wallace. DONT MISS OUT. Ive always wanted to see GW. But I couldnt afford to go but my bf found us tickets halfpriced shows great deal and went strait away to get us tickets. but more on that review under GW. n nThis is an older casino but still full of fun espec w George Wallace, which I cannot wait to go see again, ti also has several shops in the back which If you get the chance to ck out I highly recommend.",2
"Nice place. Great indoor outdoor seating. Large menu with lots of sizing options. Customizable burgers or Mac and cheese lots of salads as well. nWe tried a few different things really good chicken and basic cheeseburger sliders the pb j was tasty as well, but the most interesting thing we tried was the ""exotic "" selection of rabbit. That's right. A bunny burger. Quite tasty. nService was excellent, food came out quickly and refills on drinks were plentiful. nOne star off for having to order the fries and tots a la carte and the music selection should be a bit more family friendly when it's early and there's lots of kiddos in the place. nWe will be back for sure!",2

"I had the chance to stay at the Aria during a business trip. I have to say it was very nice. Everything was automated. The blinds opened and the TV greeted me when I first walked in. The bath was nice and the restaurants were great. I especially enjoyed the Thai restaurant. n nIt was a bit far from the strip so the British pub was the go to place. In addition, it was close to a number of stores.",2
Amazing food. Steak Chilliques is the best! Very good coffee. Friendly relaxed atmosphere.,2
"I had a craving for French cuisine while in Vegas and Bouchon did not disappoint. I was excited to see that the Croque Madame was available on the dinner menu, since I had seen the pictures on Yelp and had hoped to try it. The Madame was delicious! n nAmong the other dishes we ordered, the salmon appetizer stood out. The service was very prompt. We never had to ask for more bread to go with the salmon spread, it just continued to arrive. n nWhile I felt the wine list was a bit small, I was happy with the Chardonnay that we ordered. It was rich, buttery and paired well with the dishes we ordered. n nI would definitely return and recommend Bouchon to others.",2
"The place is very cozy and well decorated. The service is a little slow, because the owner is both the chef and the waiter of the place. Food tastes great and the portions are fair. The restaurant is a mixed style of Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai cooking. Been there twice, he owner is very friendly and the dining experience was very pleasant. n nUPDATE! nI recently saw something that disgusted me. I was waiting in line to pay, and saw the chef scoop frying oil directly from the fryer to cook the food. n nAs a future biochemist, I am absolutely disgusted as I know how much toxic compounds are generated when frying food under high temperature. The oil must be changed after several days as its contents such as polyacrylamide from frying potatoes can cause breast cancers, let alone having the customers to eat it. n nTL DR The food tastes fantastic, I still hold my opinion on that, but using deep frying oil to cook my food is just disgusting, and the review remains 1 star dropped from 4 until something is changed about that.",1
"My boyfriend surprised me with a 4 course meal via Groupon to complete our last night getaway in Las Vegas. This place was beautiful 20 feet ceiling draped in chandeliers, expansive skyline views and a romantic ambiance. The food was amazing with arugula salad, pasta, flank steak with pureed potatoes and a cheesecake topped with various berries. Now the groupon deal stated that 4 courses will be accompanied by a bottle of wine. The problem the waiter who clearly found no interest in interacting with us after tossing us our pre planned menus groupon had chosen, seemed to purposefully set us up. My boyfriend asked our waiter which wine came with the dinner and he opened up the wine list and pointed to one page. Now the prices varied up to 100 , so my bf asked several times, "" so any of these wines come with the deal. "". The waiter hastily stated yes, yes, yes. So we chose a 94 Cabernet with our meal. We had a lovely evening together until the bill came. Now don't get me wrong, we came to Las Vegas to spend money but voluntarily. Not only did the bill include a 55 dollar gratuity but also the price of the wine plus tax. WHOA! We signaled for our waiter and informed him of his apparent mistake, but he seemed to no longer speak proper English. So the manager was summoned and we let him hear our grievance quietly as to not disturb the other guest, He stated, ""Why would you believe that a 94 bottle of wine would be included in the meal? "" We explained the exchange with the waiter seriously my BF asked at least 5 times and the groupon deal. At this point I'm starting to get ticked off because the manager was just being condescending and dismissive. After 6 minutes of an all out discussion, I said, "" Just pay the bill so I can write a review. "" Then the manager seemed to change his tune. All in all, we walked away paying 22 for the gratuity but it ruined my whole surprise Las Vegas vacation. I will never return to the Palms nor the Nove EVER AGAIN!",1
The customer service is the worst. They all walk around in imaginary demon costumes because that's what they act like . Ashley Easley or at least that's what she tells customers is the most rudest person ever. It amazes me how they are still in business. I am a makeup artist and I work with a lot of other makeup artists in the industry which isn't very big in Arizona and I will make sure to let them know to stay 6000000 feet away from Easley's Dumb Shop! Thanks for nothing monsters of customer service you guys SUCK!,1
"My friends and I went to Over Easy for breakfast on Sunday. We had a friendly greeting and a brief wait. The majority of their restaurant is an enclosed outdoor patio. They had fans blasting, but we were in the mood for A C so we sat inside. The waitress told us they are moving down the street in September so they'll have added space and a lunch menu. n nOur table got the half order of the caramel banana french toast as an appetizer appetizers at breakfast? Why not? The dish was delicious! I couldn't have eaten a whole plate, but sharing it was perfect. The nuts, banana and caramel toppings were a great combo to top nice, thick slices of french toast. n nI ordered The Dolly sandwich It was pretty basic English muffin sandwich with scrambled egg, cheddar cheese, bacon, and tomato . I was in a simple mood, but I was a worried I'd pretty much just ordered an Egg McMuffin. It was definitely not a McMuffin. The english muffin was crispy, the eggs were fluffy, real melted cheddar cheese, and the bacon was crispy just as I requested. I got a side of sweet potato tater tots why haven't I ever seen these before? What a great concept! n nWhen in the area, I'd definitely have breakfast here again.",2
"I guess it's something everyone has to do once, and once is plenty. n nIf you're going to go to the top of the Stratosphere, you might as well do it at night when everything is lit up. You start the process by taking a few escalators and walking past several tourist trap stores before getting to the line for tickets. If you're a tourist, it costs 10 bucks or so to get to the top. For a local, its a couple of bucks less. As previously mentioned, it's like an airport getting through security. Place all your belongings in a plastic bin. Pass through metal detector, get the wand treatment and your off. Oh but wait, you also have to be accosted by the souvenir photo takers. n nThe elevator ride to the top is quick. The first level you you step onto is still enclosed. And yes, there's even a Starbucks at the top of the Stratosphere. To see the great view, just head up the stairs, where you're finally outside. For me, he reason to go to the top is the view itself. For others it's the insane rides. There's a ride that slides you down a teeter totter type deal over the edge. Another take you over the edge and spins you around. These rides cost money on top of what you paid to get there. If you're a thrillseeker, you'll love it. n nMy guess is the Stratosphere is like the western Empire State Building. Cross it off life's to do list and move on. n nP.S. On the way down, the elevator op started giving her bullet point fun facts speech, only she gave us the version intended for the ride up. It was high hilarity.",1
"If I can be honest, my wife, daughter and I simply tried to make the most of it since we were almost certain we would be murdered. It was scary as hell and there was NOTHING even worth considering buying. It's dirty, gross and in the middle of a nowhere totally freaky town. I'm actually positive that this is the town that ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn "" took place in at the end. n nStay away, go find a scorpion to sting you in the eye instead.",1
"I ordered from this location last night around 10 15. I got a medium pizza the works and the bacon cheese breadsticks. About an hour after eating a few slices of each I began to feel sick but didn't think anything of it. However, by 1am I was curled up next to the toilet until 9am. I threw out the rest of the food and vow to never order from this location again. In fact, this incident has completely ruined the entire restaurant for me. I hope this location gets it together before they wind up hurting someone even worse.",1
"Not bad. This place threw me off initially, wit the ""seat yourself "" sign. I was actually hunting for what I thought might be ""Typhoon. "" Said screw it, walked inside. The decor seems purposefully cobbled together with random items, sliding barn doors, barrels, but mixed in with glass and steel. n nFood. Good. Only peeve about this is that I'm pescatarian, so I am pretty limited to eating stuff with tofu and or shrimp. I wish they had more veggie options for appetizers. Since they don't do subs or removals, don't even bother thinking of asking about it. Easier on the kitchen taff, harder on you. But, i can roll with the minimalism. n nAlso, the spice levels. I asked initially is it ""American style hot "" or ""Thai Style hot. "" Think Thai style plus ""Holy Crap. "" They go wild in the kitchen. I went for a 3 on the 5 scale and was on fire. I like the heat, but the cooks have to cool out with whatever they are doing in there. I now go for level 1 on the scale, then add hot sauce to taste. Even that was scary. I put a dime's worth of sauce on some Pad Thai, and that lit up the whole plate. I'm not an American wuss, but I was struggling. n nThe staff service is OK, mostly friendly, but I think that when the traffic ramps up, you can see the stress on servers faces. Understandable, but a little distracting. n nI love the drink menus. Mexican Coke? For the win. n nAll in all, not bad, but could use an extra ""something. """,2
Be ready to wait at least an hour after your appointment time every time you walk in the door.,1
i love this place. there's so much i want to try like the suicide squeeze pictured up there .but i always seem to stick to the first thing i ever ordered and love.the razzle dazzle.,2
"Very hip pizza and wine bar on Mill Ave. If you are looking for a grown up, but hip place in the heart of Mill, then this is the place. This place has a great patio area that is nice and typically far enough away from the Mill Kids Bums, so you can enjoy a nice AZ day or evening without being asked for change. Inside is very hip and at night it has a very hip, chic, romantic, true wine bar feel to it. I like to sit inside or out. n nThe food is very dependable and there are many options. The Farmer's Salad comes highly recommended from my wife, but the last two times they have run out of peaches. It is light, but packs nice flavor. We never get too upset when someone runs out of a seasonal product i.e. peaches , because it gives us comfort that they use fresh ingredients. I'd recommend you go with a Pizza and Salad or Pizza and Bruschetta. The bruschetta is very solid and they use nice oils and seasonal veggies and great basil. You have a couple of good bruschetta options something that I am not sure why more places do not offer . It is not quite as good as Postino bruschetta, but pretty darn close. The pizzas are the same the margherita is a safe, but solid choice. Again they use nice good ingredients and the oil is great. The crust is nice and thin and crispy with the right balance of chewy. n nI highly recommend you pair any meal with a glass of wine, but if you are going to enjoy a full evening and truly embrace the ambiance, settle in with a bottle. Another tip Sundays and Mondays are half price bottle bringing the prices back down to want we'd pay at a wine shop.",2
"I really like this place . we've been there twice once during football Sunday and once on a random weekday and both times, really enjoyed the food and the service. We just moved from Maryland recently and I graduated from the University of Maryland so I loved our UMD alum server too! Yum yum wings and there are PLENTY of TVs throughout the restaurant, including TV sound on their outdoor patio. I would definitely recommend however, if you're going for football, go early to guarantee yourself a table.",2
"Some of the girls and I decided to go out after work today. Since it was my turn to decide, I thought we'd get some coffee instead. We came here 'cos the one in Liberty Center, across the street from where I work, is only open until 6pm or so. This one, in the Cultural Distract, is open a little later. n nI can't believe I never reviewed the Downtown Crazy Mochas before. They have fabulous coffee here! It's a really nice place to unwind after a day at the office, or if you're going to the theater, or if you need a quick caffeine fix at the office.",2
We were so excited to try their burgers so we made the 30 min drive. I was shocked to find out that they were in a dirty gas station. To play it safe I ordered one before I ordered for the whole family. Took a bite and it tasted like a microwaved burger super gross. We ended up driving to in and out totally disappointed.,1
Rick did a good job and went out of his way to help us out. If you want the company that's going to go the extra mile then Rick and the carpet monkeys are who you should call. Thanks again Rick!,2
"Great food! I would have never known sushi could be soo good if I'd not gone with friends. I'm not be any means a sushi eater but this place definitely changed my perspective. My favorites were the Avacado roll and Chilean Sea Bass skewers. Single mixed drinks are strong which is great because I hate water downed drinks. If going with a group as I did, and plan on drinking, DO NOT opt for the 3 4 mixed drink carousel tower! It's a major rip off for the price they charge for it 70. You're definitely better off buying individual drinks which are nice and strong. Great atmosphere seating music.",2
"Will someone explain why there are no Waffle House's in Cali ? n nUsually male waiters suck as they don't pay attention to the small things but this group was on it "" n nThe food here is so good and greasy. Lol n nThe place is very clean as the staff was cleaning the entire time.",2
"Great small venue. Cheap beer, live music, pretty girl's and a nice patio. Get there early for big shows so you can be on the side of the bar where the stage is. The acoustics are much better. If you are there for the music.",2
Excellent place for a haircut. Quality haircut with little to no wait. Scalp massage is included with the haircut. It helps that the ladies are beautiful aswell.,2
"In five bullet points n n Good service. The waiter was attentive, and delivery was awfully quick. Their decor is also kinda tasteful too. n Really bland food. The menu is one of the shallowest I've seen from a real chain restaurant in years. The minestrone in particular had an issue, being spiked with some spice that way overpowered the flavor and made it horrid. The toasted ravioli appetizer was better than their ""signature "" cheese butter pasta. n In hindsight, should have gone to CPK or somewhere else instead if you want real Italian, there are local and better chain places from which to get it Olive Garden of which there is one across Chandler Blvd, north of the mall and RigaTony's both come to mind. This is a restaurant for large families that need cheap, fast food. This is probably why their meals are ""complete "" meals. n The previous occupant of the OSF space was a restaurant called Garduno's, featuring Mexican food. They did better at food than OSF. n How has this chain not only been in business for 42 years but expanded throughout the West and into select markets east of that? St. Louis, Indy, Minneapolis, Louisville ",1
"Wow. It really says something when the food is excellent. on a Tuesday evening none the less. n nMy mom and her sisters came to town to enjoy a girls. week out? So the obvious question always pops up. ""Where's the best buffet in town? "" The Wynn of course! n nWe meet up at the Wynn around 7 30 on a Tuesday night. Personally, my expectations of the food was kind of low since its mid week, compared to the bustling weekends. Don't get me wrong, I've eaten here at least 15 times over the past few years. n nThe price was 33.95 per person. Easily one of the highest on the strip but wouldn't you pay a few bucks more for better quality? We were thinking about going to PH Spice Market Buffet since it's a good buffet and a few dollars cheaper. But who are we kidding. A few dollars? Cmon now! This is Vegas! A few dollars means nothing. n nHere's the interesting part. Right when we were about to walk in, this lady stops us and gives us a pass for a free buffet. The only catch is that you need to sign up for a Red card, which is the Wynn players card. She couldnt use the 2nd pass since she was with her daughter who was not old enough to gamble. That was really nice of her. Since there was no line to the buffet cashier, I ask her if this was legit and how it worked. The super nice cashier told us to go to the Red card booth and fill out an application for a new players card. She also mentioned that if we asked for two free buffets instead of one, they would give us that too. They just dont advertise it. Sweet! n nSo I sign up for a card as well as my auntie and we both received a free buffet meal. Not bad. We just saved ourselves 70. The only catch is that you have to be a NEW applicant. n nLets get to the real review. The food. All I can say was WOW. Like I mentioned before, I didn't have high expectations for a mid week 8 30 pm buffet. Boy was I wrong. I think this was one the better meals I've had at this buffet. n nMy first place included lots and lots of chilled king crab legs. The half shelled crab legs were plentiful and had huge portions of meat on then. I also packed on the jumbo peeled shrimp and some smoked salmon. n nMy second plate included a rare slice of prime rib, pork dumplings, english sole, caesar salad, and VEAL SHORTRIBS! YUM! n nFor dessert, I had a small bite of a variety of their offerings. Cheesecake, carrot cake, pecan pie, mint chocolate mousse cake, pear mousse cake, creme brulee, and some coconut ice cream. n nBottom line. THIS IS THE BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS!",2
"We got a great deal on a studio condo at The Signature through craigslist.com. In case you haven't heard, renting one of the many condos available in LV through CL is a great way to get a nice room for less than retail price. The room was big and clean accurately represented by the photos on the website . The bed was really comfy and the furnishings were nice. Each tower has its own pool, so there was plenty of room to spread out and lounge. As everyone says, it was a pretty long walk to the main casino floor at the MGM. Walking to the front lobby to catch a taxi will probably take you about 20 minutes. However, it was a very clean, quiet place to stay and if I got the same deal I would probably choose this place again.",2
Not good enough for the price. 16 for chicken.,1
"I called today to ask if they do lion cuts on cats, explaining that I was worried that my cat never had one before and asking if it's somehow traumatizing for the animal and how exactly they do it. The lady I spoke to was extremely rude and not helpful. It felt like she didn't really want to talk to me or answer any questions about their services. I am surprised that anyone would be that rude when a potential new customer calls. Needless to say, I am not going to use their services or recommend them to anyone else.",1
"We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and Steak Frites. and one cocktail. Our food didn't take very long and the portion, at least for the chicken was good. The restaurant was very loud and it was very difficult to carry on a conversation. The Chicken and Waffles were tasty but I've had much better. The chicken was a thin breast that looked and tasted like big chicken fingers. The Steak frites was tough. We sent it back and they removed the charge. We had the lemon bar cr u00e8me brulee for dessert. It came almost frozen. Although edible, it wasn't very flavorful.",1
"Maybe it's because I had really high expectations that I was let down. I read all the great reviews by other yelpers and couldn't wait to try this place. n nThere's only one word to describe it bad. I went there yesterday with my sister for brunch. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and my sister ordered the salty crepes. My plate wasn't so bad, but still mediocre. The crepes were absolutely disgusting! The crepes were too sweet and the filling chicken and spinach was flat and soggy. I tried it and couldn't swallow what I ate. n nThe only reason I gave them the second star is because the service was very relaxed and easy going i liked that.",1
Hands down the best board shops in Las Vegas!,2
"US Airways sent me here when I missed the last flight out of Phoenix. Keep in mind that my first experience with them was at night, 2 30 AM, when they probably did not have the best staff on call. n nWhen I called them for a shuttle, they told me that one was coming without taking down my name or telling me how long it would be before the shuttle arrived. When the shuttle arrived 30 minutes later, there were 20 other people waiting for the shuttle and people who called ahead or waited longer were not given priority. When I called to request more shuttles, they said another one would be coming within 15 minutes, and that they would be sending 2 shuttles due to the large number of people waiting. Unfortunately, these 2 shuttles did not materialize so I ended up taking a taxi to the hotel a 5 10 minute, 20 drive that I wish I had taken sooner. n nWhen I told the receptionist while checking in that the shuttle was taking a long time, and that they never sent the 2 shuttles they promised, he dismissed my comments and essentially called me a liar. n nIn the morning, I overheard the morning receptionist carefully taking down names of people who requested a shuttle, and telling callers their shuttle's ETA. My take away is to make sure when requesting shuttles that they take down your name so that you reserve a spot. Also, the late night service might not be as prompt, and a taxi ride might be worth the cost. n nOn the plus side the morning receptionist was competent. The breakfast was also nicer than most hotels' breakfasts, with delicious pancakes and sausages, and piles of scrambled eggs. n nWhile a stay here might be pleasant ordinarily, my experience was frustrating.",1
"I've been here twice now. The moviegoing experience was great both times. My problem with the initial experience was with the lobby. The concession area was disorganized and slow, while the bathrooms were small and dirty. n nThe bathrooms are still small, but they were clean this time I suppose it helps that we were there right as they opened the doors . The concession signage has improved and it's now clearer where you line up for beer and wine only versus sausages, beer and wine. And I assume the other lines are for non alcoholic purchases. n nThe bottom line is that this is easily the most comfortable venue for catching the latest flicks. Their pricing is surprisingly competitive. If not for the drive, I'd choose this place every time.",2
"Went here per recommendation from a couple friends. Ordered the special grinder and was hoping for something special. Once I got home and took a bite, I was sorely disappointed with the seasoning. The sandwich was really bland and didn't taste like anything. Will try them one more time for their cheesesteakes, but will stop patronizing them after that. Real disappointment.",1
"I always see their commercials on tv and always hear people raving about them.so we gave in, and decided to go with the crowd. n nFirst of all pricing, is no great feat. at 11.99 1.99 Drink you are looking at the same price as a buffet at one of the casinos. We knew this going in but people said that it was ""Southern Comfort Food "" so we should try it. n nEverything that they have at this buffet, except the chocolate fountains, is found at any other buffet in Las Vegas. for a better price and quality as well. Their food is typical of a regular buffet and besides their chocolate fountains, nothing stands out. n nYou seat yourself during the slow periods and then get seated during busy times. Alot of their items were out as well throughout the buffet including their deviled eggs and the pizza was empty every time we got up to get some. n nAt least at a casino buffet, they refill everything right away. And the service is way better. The waiters here are so overworked that they tend to ignore tables, not their fault though. n nWill I come back? No, honestly, but they seemed VERY busy so obviously I may be missing something here.",1
I live in the area near Retro Bakery. I stopped in a couple times for cupcakes. I tried 4 or 5 different flavors. They're ok. Way too sweet for my liking. All their cake taste pretty much the same. The super sweet buttercream is what has the different flavors. I've had better. But their service was great. Very nice people and very helpful.,1
"Pretty nice bar on Mill. There is a full bar on the inside, as well as the outside. On Fridays and weekends, the inside dance floor is so packed. There are two lines outside that are pretty long. The free line, which of course is super long and the VIP line which is only like 5 to get in and is way faster so I suggest doing that.",2
"Interesting unique place to spend some time. My girlfriend and I spent an evening here attending their ""Dining in the Dark "" event. Before, and after, we were blindfolded to eat our delicious meal, we walked around and enjoyed the artsy decor. This place is well set up and inviting. A welcome change to mammoth resort casinos where you need a map to find your way around. A tip their parking is across the street in a lot which does not seem like a parking lot. Or, spend a few bucks and use their valet service.",2
"Don't buy anything from here! Their cigars are dry. The "" walk in humidor "" is sub par! I purchased a 35 dollar blazer torch lighter. After filling it with butane I discovered it had no spark, broken! I tried to return it six days latter with a receipt. The owners son became argumentative, loud, and rude. He said they wouldn't return or replace it. No, and I mean NO customer service ! I wish I had read other reviews before buying anything from there. Seams like others had the same complaint. I'll be contacting the BBB and filling a complaint. Save your time and money, go to a real tobacco shop. n nUpdate it's now closed.",1
Was in Vegas this past weekend with 4 of my friends celebrating birthdays and friendships. We are women in our late 40's and early 50's. We went to Kevin's show and had a blast! He is hilariously funny and high energy. a great entertainer. The antics onstage were really funny and we laughed the entire show. I will see his show again the next time I'm in Vegas AND I will go on stage next time. DON'T miss this show.you will laugh alot!,2
"This store is horrible. Every time we shop at this Walmart there is a problem at the register or somewhere else. nThe manager doesn't give cashiers the responsibility to correct a small transaction problem at the register. Instead, you have to wait 10 15 minutes for someone to come over with the key, so that they can continue with your transactions. We had a coupon for .50 that wasn't showing the discount. We had to wait 10 minutes for someone to come over with the key so we could get our discount. When we went out to our car we found about 100 shopping carts lined up behind our car, so we couldn't move. We had purchases that included several frozen items.We also had our 5 month old granddaughter with us who was getting hot and crying.We waited and waited for the cart people to return. They didn't. Finally some other people whose cars were also blocked arrived and were able to push the carts away from blocking our car so we could leave. nI blame everything on a very very poor manager. Obviously there is no customer service training at this store. nI am ready to travel further from our home to a different Walmart or even to Target, in an effort to get better customer service.",1
"The employees at this location are lazy and rude. Saw multiple reviews saying the same thing. Usually these things are secluded to certain store locations because it starts with the manager. Also, it's the only Costco location on the planet that closes on Saturday at 6pm!",1
Terrible service. Terrible food. I ordered wine. Very good Pinot Noir. Also ordered calamari. It was deep fried and seasoned way too much and was overall terrible. The service was horrendous. It was not busy at all and it took us an hour to get our food. Not one of Las Vegas' better restaraunts.,1
"I will not return to this burger king Ever! Being new you would think they would have a higher standard. The forgot the fries with the meal order. When the fries did come they tasted like they were cooked the day before, luke warm stale and card board texture! The two sandwiches I ordered were not much better, they tasted as if they cam from a am pm connivence store! Very disappointed with this location. I wont be back!",1
The view is beautiful. Food is good limited choices with limited quantity.,2

I had seen the commercials about ""getting my billion back "", so I decided to give them a shot. n nWhen I entered, an older, and I mean much older, employee came out to greet me and take me back to his work station where he started my tax return. He was friendly to begin with and maintained that demeanor throughout the time we worked together. However, he was horribly incompetent. He could only type one letter at a time with his pointer fingers and was therefore VERY slow. I had to point out errors he was making numerous times along with how to correct them. So after spending an hour, yes, an hour, with him, my tax return was less than half what Turbo Tax was gonna give me. Then on top of that, he wanted to charge me just under 200. I quickly escaped and never looked back. n nWent back to Turbo Tax, paid for their extra service which was only 50 and got 4 times what H R Block said they could get me. n nMoral of the story run. Run far away from them!",1
"We waited for about 30 minutes which was expected from the reviews on yelp. We got seated at the counter and ordered, small fried rice, small pork belly rice, gyoza, shoyu ramen tonkotsu shoyu ramen. nThe gyoza was flavorful and good! nThe pork belly bowl was ok. But the fried rice and ramen was a complete disappointment! The soup is nothing but BLAND! no richness at all. nWill defiantly not be back",1
"I would review the food, but after waiting for over 45 minutes, it never came. We left this place and went to another restaurant a block away. 5 minutes after leaving KanBai, we were eating a freshly cooked chinese meal. n nThis restaurant takes over from the former Ichiban Ramen restaurant and even uses their old plates and cutlery, including bowls emblazoned with ""Ichiban "" on them. It wouldn't surprise me if this restaurant is as short lived as Ichiban. n nIt is a small restaurant and although there were two waitresses, it seems that they couldn't keep up. They took a long time taking our order and as mentioned above, our food never arrived. People who came after us got their orders taken before us and even people who ordered after us got their meals before us. Ours was a simple fried chicken dish that shouldn't have taken long to prepare. The couple seated next to us waited for about 20 minutes for someone to take their leftovers and to get the bill. n nBig thumbs down for their charging of rice. 1.50 for a small portion? Better to go a two doors down to Pret a Manger or around the corner to Golden Stone. n nI'm not going to bother with this place again.",1
"My food was pretty good, got a 4 berry fizz and really enjoyed it! My Boyfriend didn't enjoy his meal as much. He wasn't impressed with the sausage or Ham in his lumberjack meal. n nService was great, friendly and talkative.",2
"I saw a picture of egg on a burger sold with the words ""japanese burger "" written on it and knew I haddddd to sneak my way here if needed!. which wasn't a problem because we actually ended up eating here twice during our trip n nI lovelovelove burgers and a big slut when it comes to eggs as Mr. Bourdain would put it so I was super stoked to find that you can add it eggs to any burger, not just the number two n nThe place is in some sort of 'asian fusion' center that has a lot of side shows going on weekend nights taiko drums, street dancers etc. n nService was super friendly. They cook everything to order, so if you're in a hurry you may not want to eat here cause it takes a little longer than fast food joint would. Burgers are cooked perfectly medium to medium rare so they are super juicy and the yolk jizzes down the center making my eyes dilate and mouth water with pleasure. n nJazz fries are good if you want something extra however just getting the garlic fries not that garlicy to be honest with the crack sauce is satisfying enough ask for extra! . n nI got the number 1 fuku 'lucky' burger and 3 buta 'pig' burger while my boyfriend got the spicy burger both trips. While they were all good I felt the number 3 had the most flavor.and spicy burger isn't so spicy, which is coming from someone who doesn't eat a ton of spicy food however one of our friends thought it was really spicy.so if you're super sensitive maybe you should just skip it . n n noverall though i believe almost everyone in our group felt satisfied eating here.and if you don't mind a little wait for your food you should definitely come here!",2
Really excellent food. Took our whole company there to celebrate a recent success and they loved it. I highly recommend the fried rice. Very tasty and not greasy. I like it because the food is very authentic yet simple and made with love. Waiter is awesome. He even played a Cambodian xylophone for us!,2
"I love this place! I wish they had them in California. I go here very time I'm in AZ at least 2 3 times. The food is always great, the place is clean and the staff is awesome and kind.",2
"First of I should mention that I enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The staff were friendly and manager was chatty and very nice. My low rating is because of the scale they used to inform clients about the level of spice in their food. As a person who was in several Indian restaurants I can say that they underestimate spices in their food, and for some people with allergic reactions it can not be very good.",1
White pizza is the best. Service can be slow when they are busy.,2
"The worst service I have ever had. Even at ihop, I expect a table check, and a refill on water. And when we went to pay, we had to wait even longer because there was no server up front to seat or check customers out. I don't expect the best food or service at ihop, I mean come on! Just look up and see what customers are doing. The restaurant was dirty and they just kept slowly working on tasks instead of food and service and customers. Never going back to this location.",1
"It kills me to only give Hyatt House Charlotte a 4 star rating due to a surprise charge at the end of my stay. This hotel was the best I'd ever enjoyed, and I've stayed at a Ritz Carlton in Dearborn and a 1,400 per night suite at the Mandalay Bay in LV. There were hundreds of things that make staying here very special, luxurious, modern, personable. The list goes on and on. Some common interests as follows n nLocation Really couldn't get much better. Located next to Time Warner Cable arena, it is a one minute walk to what I consider to be the intersection of the heart of Uptown. We were never winded walking back to the hotel after touring the city, and felt very safe. n nHotel Character Room Super modern and boutiquesh. The basic non suite is even equipped like an upscale New York apartment that includes a kitchen fully stocked with tools even a damn cheese grater! , living room area, cloud like king bed, gigantic closet, and updated bathroom area. An amazing value considering all you get in your stay. n nStaff Amenities Staff was mostly great, with the exception of the front desk people who are always chaotic, confused, and hard to get a hold of. Their performances were outweighed however but the AMAZING bar staff. James in particular could not have made the bar service better. He made friends with everyone, each night we were there. He is polite yet personable and extremely accommodating. The bar itself is a great feature of staying here. The food is incredible. My adult grilled cheese with chicken and bacon one night and cone fries with chipotle sauce were so savory. n nBreakfast I have to include this separately because their COMPLIMENTARY breakfast should retail around 15 per head per day. This was well worth the stay by itself. The food is A and has everything you can think of, including the best cheese grits ever. The woman who makes the made to order omelets is the boss of quick cooking! Best omelette I've ever eaten. n nThe only thing that bummed me out was upon check out. I received a bill that included a 22 per day for valet that totaled up to around 100. When I booked, I used the Hyatt House website specifically because there is a ""Park Stay "" offer if you book through them that waives the daily valet fee, or so it appears. Otherwise, I would have used another website that would have saved me more money in the grand scheme of things. The woman at the counter had no idea what I was talking about, so I showed her on my phone. The only stipulation reads about the booking dates which mine was well within. She had never heard of this offer so had a supervisor come to help. He seemed extremely confused, but then told me I must have just booked through the website without using the offer. I proceeded to check, and sure enough the offer page and the regular booking page both lead you to the same site! The supervisor couldn't not offer an explanation, apologized professionally, and left even though I said ""I don't understand this "". I now have my doubts as to whether or not this waiver even exists or if it's just worded so cleverly on the website to appear like you're getting a value just by having valet service. I was confused, they were confused. If anything, the mobile version of Hyatt House needs a close looking at and perhaps a revision. n nDespite the surprise charge, I would stay here in a nano second! The hotel is exceptional in so many important ways and we loved coming back to it every night.",2
"Five weeks ago, we adopted an elderly dog who had been at the SPCA for five months. This dog has turned out to be a great addition to our family. The SPCA staff was helpful and professional. This is a big city shelter that runs on donations. If this shelter were less crowded, they would not save as many dogs. We also learned that a vet appointment is important to get right away.",2
It's not Mexico but as close as you will get in Vegas. I love the chefs authentic spin on Mexican cuisine. The salsas are amazing and food will not disappoint you. Located right next to shark adventure at the Mandalay bay. Highly recommended,2
"I LOVE Dee's Donuts! The doughnuts at Dee's are fresh and don't taste heavy. It's hard to explain, but to me, their doughnuts taste like doughnuts should taste. Not overly doughy. Come early as this place does get busy in the morning. The family working behind the counter is super nice too!",2
"Everything at Rita's is delicious. I highly recommend this place. Try everything because the flavors are always changing. Yummy, yummy!",2
This place is going downhill fast. Always out of something you want to order. The food is great after you actually get it. It's such a shame I used to love this place. Took almost an hour to get yogurt and salad and ALL the waitstaff and managers look miserable. I guess it would be tough telling people you are out of something 50 times a day ,1
"Stopped in for take out to bring home my family something good for lunch. Thought I'd give this place a try since I was in the area. Although, I did not eat inside the restaurant everything from the outside looked clean and the person who took my order at the front was prompt. Stepped out for a bit to do grocery at Smith's while food was prepared before I knew it my order was good to go. Everything I ordered was tasty panang chicken, combination pad see ewe, pad tofu, and steamed white rice. These were family style entrees which could feed 4 6 depending on serving size. Had an excellent visit and the food I received was good for the price I paid, be back for more items next time!",2
"This sushi is trying to hard. Apparently people only like this place because it's ""trendy "". We ordered the best two rolls and they were basically overpriced shitty California rolls compared to the decently priced and delicious sushi that we experience in Houston, TX.",1
"Huge beer selection. About 30 drafts and it looks like hundreds of different type bottles not really sure . n nWaitress was terrible and even said so when we were paying. Were is the management? n nWe had a large group and ordered several apps. Took 50 minutes for the apps. The wings are OK but about the time we were finishing the wings our waitress finally showed up with plates for everyone and napkins. Not great to eat a wing and have no place to put the bone. The nacho's came out cold with some of the worst cold soggy cheese. Meh. n nFinally were asked if we wanted to order our meals and it took 45 minutes. Most just ordered some type of burger and most said it was well done, not the way it was ordered. I chose the Santa Fe wrap and it was OK. n nThe place was so noisy, yea the football games were on. So if you are not in a hurry or just want some beer this is an OK place.",1
"My favorite restaurant in the WORLD! Besides the cost, what is there not to like about this place if you love to eat premium meat cuts. 17 or 18 different meats and they're all brought to you hot and fresh and cut right onto your plate. Even the servers make me feel extra special. When I ask for more some of them say ""only for you "". Only for me? I know they say that for everyone but it still makes me feel special inside haha. I can go there and eat nothing but meat which is what I've done whenever I've gone but everyone loves to salad bar which is also all you can eat. The mash potatoes are ridiculous good as well. n nYes, it is a bit expensive so you can't go there as much as you'd want to but that's the way it is. Every time I've gone it's during restaurant weeks so instead of the 45 50 it usually is it's around 30 35 and it's hard to turn that down. If you've never been here or to a Braziian streakhouse you have to try Chima.",2
Horrible Service and the staff was rude. Not enjoyable at all. Shuttle stops at 5pm to the strip and didnt even mention that on the groupon! The room wasnt even as great as the groupon made it look and had a horrible view out of our window. Definitely learned my lesson and going to start staying on the strip. I would give this 0 stars if i could.,1
The food is okay.but I had a bad experience with them last time and the food is not that good to go back there. n nI had a discount coupan from yelp for sushi 21 when I got there the waitress started making excuses and eventually said we only do this for people who eat here and yours is a take out. It was only a 2 dollar discount but they arguing and making up excuses for 2 dollars specially in a very rude manner was a bummer. I would not go back.specially it is very close to Goyemon sushi its so easy to switch.,1
"Fantastic. This is a great place to get some tasty Mexican food and margaritas. The Prickly Pear Margarita is wonderful, but you have to have a sweet tooth for it, however, their regular lime margaritas are some of the best in town. n nThe Motto of the restaurant is ""Some like it hot "" and for the most part, you do need to like spicy food to eat here. There are menu items that are low on the spicy side, however the salsas are usually pretty hot. When I say ""usually "" it means that it isn't always very spicy and this when people can be disappointed in the restaurant. Everything is homemade and made by scratch, which is a good thing but doesn't mean everything is going to be the same. The chili's that they use to make the salsa and sauces etc, are spicy depending on the season. Just like in the store, you can only really get cherries at certain times . I've found the the summer season, esp. June is when Molinos is at its hottest ate there a few days ago and had to down 3 huge glasses of water to make it through the meal . In the winter months things are usually not very hot there. But still tasty. n nWhat I usually get is the Carne Adovada Chimichanga with green chili. it is to die for, I've gotten it many times and I would have to say its one of the best chimichanga I have ever had. A couple of other items that are good is the blue corn enchiladas with green chill and the carne adovada platter is excellent. n nThe reason Molinos doesn't get five stars is because service can sometime be. interesting. This one on Washington isn't very busy, however, it seems like there is really only one waiter taking care of the restaurant so it can take time to place orders, but food comes out quickly. n nThe Molinos on Central Ave, there are more servers but it ten times busier and when the servers hostess gets stressed out they tend to take it out on the costumers. I had called in to get a table of eight reserved, however, when I got there with five of us and the other three where in the parking lot. I asked for our table and the hostess looked at us and asked for the rest of our party. I explained that they were on their way in. And she replied well they're not with you, we're giving your table away. My three other people walked in before she finished saying this and she refused to change her mind. n nI would highly recommend going to the Molinos on Washington instead of Central.",2
"If there was halves I'd give this place 2 1 2 stars. Bar is in a great location, elevated on the second level in the downtown area. Outside bar is even better but they call this place a sports bar for a reason. Food is not the best by any means. I ordered a burger and it was okay. Waitress had recommended the sweet potato fries to me and they were nothing special. n nOverall, this is a good sports bar with mediocre food. TV's are located throughout so you are bound to find whatever team you are rooting for! n nAlso, the men servers in a kilt is a little weird to look at so be prepared!",1
"Very excited that this concept finally turned into reality! 18 local businesses each with a sampling of their small boutiques. Quirky, trendy, all around interesting and cool.you will get a great selection of items to shop for, as well as an opportunity to see some businesses you might have otherwise not known existed. n nVery excited to see the likes of the Queen Creek Olive Mill I buy all of my olive oils from them.and just added my latest purchase of bacon olive oil over the weekend Smeeks, Frances, Customatic all within close proximity of one another. The new restaurant has the most amazing olive oil cupcakes I personally love the lemon and the orange cupcakes because you can really taste the olive oil . n nAfter reading reviews, I am going to go back into Citrine to find out more about their business. The British Bicycle Company has some awesome bikes, and I'm also going to check that out when I have more time.",2
"What an incredible experience! If you are looking for an amazing view of the strip and a wonderful meal.you have to try this place. n nThe views from the restaurant and the adjacent lounge are awesome. The lounge has an outdoor seating area with heat lamps when it is chilly. n nWe had a wonderful lobster salad as a starter. For the main course we both ordered steaks, cooked to perfection. The sides of fork crushed potatoes and mushrooms were tasty. n nGreat wine list and great service. We will absolutely dine here again! n nToo bad the casino wasn't as friendly and our winnings were non existent! ",2
"I've had better wings and service elsewhere, but our friends wanted to meet here last night so we hoped our opinion would be changed. Unfortunately, it was worse than previous experiences. We had a large party and sat out on the patio. Our waitress basically informed us that it was ""crazy "" inside, so sorry if she neglects us. Some people at our table got their drinks and some of us waited and waited. Finally, the manager came out and apologized, and said that the fries and cheese curds were late but they were on the way! Funny enough, we already had the fries and cheese curds on the table but we were still waiting for all the rest of the food. Long story short, our food was never put in and we had to get it in to go boxes because it had been so ridiculously long. We did get 1 drink taken off the bill but I didn't really feel like that did us justice for the totally unfortunate experience. I give it two stars because the chips and queso was pretty delicious.",1
"I'm sorry to say that I finally left this place. Many of may favorite instructors did as well. It's a ghost town, sad hot steamy place with bad instructors. One value that any business owner should know is to keep your employees happy. Obviously they weren't.",1
"I really really wished they had a place like this in cali. southern cali specifically since I live in LA, cause we have nothing like this here and I am more the jealous. This is basically a genghis khan self service version you get soup! So the fun and excitement of this place is that you are able to pack your food into your bowl. as much as you want. whatever you want. however you want. including the meat! It was soo funn I've never gotten to do that and I seriously had the best 5 mins of my life. Sauces are delicious and I got creative with the sauces mixing a couple of flavors and added green onions and peanuts",2
"good price, good food, good service, what more can you ask for. one of my favorite places. they always make you feel so welcome!",2
"I just discovered this place and I really like it! The food is fairly consistent but depending on the day and time you go and who's in the kitchen, you might get a drier or a fattier brisket, an overcooked or undercooked turkey breast, etc. The meat combo plates are a great way to try different items and are perfect for someone as indecisive as I am. I adore the green beans with bacon side and I usually get a double order. The chopped brisket is the best thing here, followed by the chicken breast. The turkey has been hit or miss and the sausages are just ""okay. "" n nAll drinks come in a big, sturdy plastic yellow cup. They have sweet and unsweetened tea and free pickles and ice cream eat 'em together or separately, whatever floats yer boat . Not much atmosphere to speak of but I like how you order, pay, and a runner brings your food to the table. You fix your own drinks.",2
"My favorite steakhouse in Charlotte! Yes it's a chain, but not every Capital Grille gets 5 stars from me. For example, the one in Chicago is 4, mainly due to ambiance. The was the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Charlotte and continues to be a place to go for dinner or dessert after dinner somewhere else. For me, the best cheesecake in town. Great patio for outdoor seating. Great open bar with top notch service. This is a place to indulge for dinner and wine. Both menus are impressive. Open kitchen concept makes the feeling in the restaurant a little more lively. n nThe Delmonico steak is great as well as the filet. Depending on the size of the lobster tail that night, getting it as an appetizer is a sure way to make the bill skyrocket, but hey, we only live once!",2
"Yes, tonight was a special occasion, and what a special night it was. n nThis is our first visit to this location, and after reading the reviews on Yelp, we had to give it a try. To top it off, we were confident that this would be the right place to spend this occasion, and let me tell you we were not disappointed. n nFor starters, I used Yelp, to place the reservations online via the open table reservations. It was simple and since I prepared two weeks in advance the time slot was readily available. n nUpon arriving at the restaurant, they offer courtesy valet parking, a private parking lot, and a parking garage for your convenience. The hostess met us at the door, she was very friendly, and took our names for the reservation. We were very promptly seated, our drinks were promptly filled with water, and bread and butter was provided at that time. Our server was at our table just after the water finished flowing and was very informative regarding the menu. n nI would have provided pictures as I normally do, however, I did feel somewhat uncomfortable trying to take photos during this special night, and opted to just write a review instead. n nMy wife's meal consisted of the Petite Filet, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. I had the Ribeye with the BBQ Crab Steak Topping which had a very buttery yet skampi ish type flavor. It had a very nice flavor and the crab was awesome. n nWe skipped the desert , and headed to the Cheesecake Factory across the street, but let me tell you that the deserts that passed by our table looked very good. n nThis meal had all of the essentials of an great meal. Great service, great food, and while I may have splurged tonight, it was definitely placed on our to be back lists, regardless of the occasion. n nI am stingy with my stars, but this was a solid 5 star experience. n nNCFoodGuy",2
I use them personally and recommend them professionally. Rod Odell knows his stuff. The staff that comes out is always friendly.,2
"Ugh. Just when I was getting happy with my little area of Tempe. I have my coffee, my hair salon, my cute boutique shop, my dive bar, my Fresh and Easy, and then they had to add a Wal Mart. A little part of me died the day I saw the coming soon sign. A little part of me dies every time I see the building and I have to admit I don't cross the intersection of Southern and Rural much anymore. n nHowever, as chance would have it, I was looking for a very specific item this weekend and the only place I knew that carried it as the model I found first was about to be discontinued was at Wal Mart. So, I put on my best pair of loungewear meets dancewear and forced myself in. The store is small thank God and is not a large vastly sized super jungle. n nI first attempted to search for the item, and had no success. I then headed to customer service to see if they could check and see if another store had the item. I gave them the information that is listed on the company website to use and was given back a blank stare. Apparently the information listed on the website for the online store items cannot be used to look up inventory? n nI am now trying to gain back brain cells.",1
"Walked in to get food and drinks with parents and friends there was 6 of us we turned the tables like we always do when we dine there . The bartender immediately stopped us and said we had to sit In the dinning room. I asked if we would have service and he said yes. He ignored us for 10 minutes . I walked up to him in the bar to see if we could have service and he yelled "" hey sweetheart "" I have a full bar you can leave. Then he demanding us to leave. My father who is in his late 60's is a classy man and was disgusted with the way he treated women. Needless to say we have been coming for years and will never be back ! What a joke. GM or owners fire your graveyard male bartender.",1
"I adore this place. I've had variety of sandwiches from them and they are always huge, delicious and reasonably priced. Their hot pepper cheese balls and Mac and cheese are also amazing. nIt is an outside place on the side of route 51 which I suppose is a small downfall but it doesn't keep me from giving it 5 stars. They have a few picnic tables you can sit at but otherwise it's more of a take out type place. nYou can also have them cater larger events which I've only experienced once but it was just as good as it is when I get a single sandwich. The food only takes them about 10 min to have ready for you as well or you can always call ahead and order too! nI've had their chicken bacon ranch and buffalo chicken sandwiches and both are sooo good. I've also had their regular Philly cheesesteak and their chicken Philly cheesesteak and neither of those have disappointed either. Their pulled pork is equally amazing. The big pig sandwich is one of my absolute go to items on their menu, being that they are obviously a BBQ place as you can see from the name, you know their BBQ sandwiches have to be amazing. n nGo here asap! You're welcome in advance. ",2
"Mmm Sunset Grille, thanks for a super tasty lunch! n nI've been meaning to drop by this new resto in place of Las Ramblas and I finally got there for a working lunch. Both my compadre and I enjoyed our meals and friendly, efficient service. n nInside Sunset Grille hasn't changed in much of the way of design from Las Ramblas . It's still a open restaurant with a pretty sweet bar in the middle I would imagine it's pretty great for large parties, too. The menu is diverse everything from BBQ prior Mac's BBQ chef , to burger, to fish dishes, to creative salads. It's definitely a restaurant that will satisfy the masses. n nI went with the catfish tacos two generous tacos stuffed with seared catfish, some type of shredded lettuce mix and a really delicious and spicy sauce. Delish! While I stopped myself after 1.5 tacos, I could have wolfed down the rest if it were dinner time! n nWinos, take note, they have a pretty damn extensive wine list that I will be absolutely returning for. I also saw some pretty decadent desserts come out.many reasons to return for more! FYI they are serving Sunday brunch now, too!",2
This is a great store to shop at with a very helpful sales team. I was visiting from Chicago when I stopped this wonderful store! Everyone I worked with was great and very helpful with a smile. Wish there was a store in Chicago!,2
Me and my husband are regular customers since remodel! They have great lunch specials including sushi! My favorite is the kimchi chigae! Ambience gets better after 6 or 7pm. Lots of Koreans come that means it's good right!?,2
"Upon my return to Olives, I had one of the most romantic and wonderful experiences ever in Las Vegas. The food was exceptional, the service was out standing. But what took my breath away is sitting outside next to the fountains at night during a full summer moon. I felt like we weren't in Las Vegas, between the cuisine, wine and service. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back upon my next visit to Las Vegas!",2
Malaya had a lovely selection of vegetarian dishes from multiple cultures. I stayed close to Malaysian cuisine with steamed Vegetable Potiah appetizer and Tofu Sambal. My mouth celebrated the rich flavors and varied textures of the dishes. It's worth more time to further explore their menu.,2

Great local spot! Sweet home Alabama and bread is excellent! nIf you are in the downtown area and want a tasty treat,2
"Ive been to a couple of these around the country. but for this time this year, the service was horrible no thanks to cody d. looks like it is run by freshmen, college kids were just hanging at the hostess counter. cody forgot my chowder and didnt apologize. but ill say that the crab cake dinner was good so ill give an extra star for that.",1
"Its such a gem off the strip. Its actually a bar so hide your children or your wife . The portions are gigantic but watch out for the 5 sharing fee. Since there's only about 20 seats and typically a huge line, come during the off hours like breakfast. The chef is also hilarious. Here's an interaction we saw with a customer n ""Where is the oysters from "" n ""The water "" n ""Which water? "" n ""Walmart "" n n ""How do you cook it? "" n ""With Magic "" n nWould definitely come back here just for entertainment.",2
"So, it was just okay ice cream. My biggest complaint was not that. It was actually. the spoons. I don't want rough wood on my tongue. There I said that phrase out loud, and I would actually not eat there again just because of the coarse wooden spoons. I wasn't the only one in our birthday group that made the, It feels like I just licked a napkin face. In fact, one of the girls' spoon snapped in two while trying to scoop some of the gummy chocolate out of hers. She threw the almost full cup now with splinter sprinkles away. nI've had better ice cream at Baskin Robbins and made no spoon induced grimaces while doing it.",1
"I haven't been in here in almost 10 years and it's just like I remember it. The food is still excellent, the view is still gorgeous and the decor is exactly the same. I would give the restaurant five stars on food and view alone but the place just feels so outdated and needs a face lift. The giant bubbly fish tank when you walk in, the faux palm trees on the ceiling, the dark and dingy entrance way before you take the elevator up. n nbut on to the positives. I went here for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all so we got a great window seat. I ordered the rodi grille salmon with a side of green beans in a sweet chili sauce. The salmon comes in a teriyaki sauce and was grilled to perfection. I also ordered a glass of the Riesling and it was on the sweeter side but really good. For dessert, I opted for the birthday cake cheesecake and it went beyond my expectations. If you don't have a sweet tooth then this dessert isn't for you because I'm pretty sure I got a sugar high. It was a cheesecake with birthday cake layers. The icing was delicious and it looked a bit like a mini confetti birthday cake. YUM! n nI also sampled the crab cakes that my coworker ordered, which they are known for. Fabulous. All in all, good experience although I'll issue fair warning that it's a pricey meal even if you opt out of wine and dessert. Good service, awesome food, I just can't get past that awful outdated 80s decor.",2
"Went on to Baci website and was excited to see they had great to go specials. I called to place my order and was told that there was a misprint on the website. I asked, why is it still on your website? The girl said that they don't run the website and they can't figure out how to take it down. I said, well will you honor the special and the girl said yes. I began to tell her what I wanted on my pizza, she then said ""oh I forgot to tell you that we need to charge you for the price of half the pasta in order to honor the special. "" Well in order to honor the special clearly displayed on the website you shouldn't be charging anything extra! Told the girl to forget it. What a joke! Do not recommend.",1
"Okay, so for ambience I gave this place stars. BUT, if this were just based on the food I would give no starts. My husband is Italian and his father owned to traditional Italian restaurants in our home town. That being said, we still appreciate the modern twist to Italian too however, this was neither. They make their own pasta but it's is sticky, tastless and chewy. It was aweful. My husband and I both got pasta dishes and on both they cook forgot things that were supposed to be cooked into the pasta. My huband got a spinach pasta, the guy forgot to cook it in so his thought put the pasta from the plate back in the skillet, add in the spinach and mix it around a couple of times. Needless to say, it was like cold raw spinach leaves with your hot pasta didn't really go. The other thing no one is coming around and refilling drinks or taking your plates or bringing you your food so why would you have that massive clear box for tip money right where the hostess is when you go up to pay. It just seemed tacky. n nYou can't have it both ways either you are like a deli where you order at the counter and get your food or have someone come around and at least refill your drinks, bus your tables which was not done and making sure everything is okay. n nI think this place has potential but it just totally misses the mark. The other thing if you want a drink you've go to go to the bar to order it, then you have to go to this line for this, then this line for that just doesnt make that much sense to me.",1
"This is an amazing place to eat! It's fast, it's easy, it's cheap.but the food is plentiful, healthy and unbelievably delicious! All my co workers looove this place and we all come here sometimes twice a week for lunch or dinner. This is the chipotle of mediterranean food, yet sooo much better! You won't be let down, I promise!",2
"If you enjoy thin walls and crack head neighbors along with laundry facilities you can't use and are double charged for, this is the place for you! Moving into a dirty falling apart unit and never having close parking spot in a scary parking lot is another benefit! One time the cops came because some guy was waving a gun around! Helicopters and bull horns in the middle of the night! The excitement doesn't end here. Tire slashings on the regular. I got bit by a dog and sick from weed smells everywhere. An oasis of crazy it's location location location!",1
Lots of beers. Good food. Nice staff. Tend to walk by you at the bar when you need a refill. n nAnd the bathroom stall door needs repaired.,2
"First time I went they were out of 4 or 5 items, so I came back a few days later, got some crappy overcooked Mac and cheese, flavorless brisket, on a cold hard bun. Went back today and they were closed during hours posted. Place won't see the new year.",1
Delicious bakery! I recommend the salted caramel brownie which really isn't like your typical brownie! A thick later of salted caramel and the brownie part is very thin and dense almost like a fudge! I also had a Napoleon which was very good,2
"Save time and money with the Marvel Home Experience. here's how in 7 easy steps! n n1. Stand in a corner for an hour. n n2. Setup your favorite light gun game. I like Duck Hunt. Stand approximately 20 feet away from the light gun for an 1 hour. n n3. Play the light gun game for 5 minutes. n n4. Walk around your house for 30 minutes trying to decide on a thing that you don't want to wait for the next hour to do. n n5. strap a lcd monitor to your ceiling, and put in an animated Marvel movie. Anyone will do it doesn't really matter. Watch that movie for 10 minutes or until your neck gets too sore to continue. whichever comes first. n n6. Sit in a chair and continue to watch that movie while rocking back and forth. Spray some compressed air in your face 4 5 times. n n7. Go online to Skymall.com and look at overpriced crap. Don't buy anything. n nThere you have it. All the fun of the Marvel Experience in your own home. n nSeriously, all the bad reviews on Yelp are fairly accurate. Really long lines, lackluster events, promised experiences that are often broken. All leading to the ridiculously overpriced gift shop. I regret every minute I spent there today. Hopefully the people in the next town this traveling circus goes to next read Yelp before buying tickets.",1
"I was all amped up to order a dozen of these ""talked about "" doughnuts but what good is it if your business is closed and it's past 6am? Maybe another day I will give this place another shot but not such a disservice for a first potential customer.",1
"I stayed at this hotel last year and it was very nice. I love the design of the rooms. Very fitting for New York. The location was a bit off the main strip area, but we had a car with us so it didn't matter so much. The best part of this hotel was all the little restaurants inside.",2
"So sorry I wasn't hungrier when I stopped here. I was on my way somewhere else, saw ""Fry Bread House "" and made an abrupt detour. I ordered the Red Chili Tamale and fry bread with cinnamon sugar. Best tamale I've ever had. The fry bread was less ""doughy "" than I'm used to and I kind of liked the crunchy edges. There is a back room where NA handcrafted jewelry is sold. I was drawn to a pretty little malachite pendant and ended up buying two of them. ""Malachite is for new beginnings, "" I was told. Perfect.",2
"If McDonald's made Chinese food it would taste like this. The price is higher than average, which just adds to the disappointment.",1
Best bagels in the world better than New York better than Toronto just come get 1 from the wooden stove and ask for cream cheese and plastic knife so u can open it up and eat just outside the store. Amazing,2
"I took my 2 sons here to try out the batting cages. This place is AMAZING! The staff is great, it is wonderful environment and my kids have so much fun in the batting cages! We also have done lessons, and will continue to do them. it is amazing how much they have learned from just a few months of WOB training. I would HIGHLY recommend it!",2
Had lunch here with my husband nhe had a beer which he said was great and an awful tasteless burger nI had a salad also tasteless nDon't waste your money,1
"Service has always been good to me here. So has the food. I'm always excited and not scared to try something new for each visit. Food has yet to disappoint me, and I plan on going many more times in the future as it's very close to where I work. Yay!",2
The Mesa location doesn't have quite the quaint charm of the Tempe location but the food is still great and the patio is ample. All the pasties on the menu are very good and the traditional ones do stay very true to the Old Country recipes. The dessert pasties are worth a try if you have room. I also enjoy picking up the ones you can finish baking at home. Drink prices are always good and they normally have specials going. My favourite is the Shepherd's Pie or the Bangers and Mash. Ask for extra red wine gravy.,2
"We really wanted to love this place, really! But sadly, we did not. n nWhere to begin, let's start with the food. We sampled a number of dishes Posada soup, Eggplant, Deep fied rib, onion tart, paella, chicken . None of our course were particularly memoriable. We were starving too, so that's not good. n nThe decor was ok, but very poor experience in a crowded restaurant trying to have a romantic dinner on date night and having an onslought of servers sprinting by us and nearly tripping on my legs. There was also something very inconsistent about what appears to be a pretty upscale place, but with a staff in jeans and t shirts. n nThe service was adequate and prompt. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to use against them, although had the food and ambiance been better, we may have felt better about the aspect too. n nIf only we were drinking, the cocktails that we saw others ordering looked really intriguing, but we were not partaking.",1
We have a fabulous meal at the Capital Grille.so many options and all delicious.our only complaint is that the wine we ordered was listed as a 2008 and it arrived as a 2010.we were told that was what they had and no price difference. It was very young.but we drank it anyway.,2
Pretty dope base! Been here a couple times!,2
"I wanted to try this place based on the highly rated reviews. I had an appointment at 11 00. It is now 11 35, thirty five minutes later and I have yet to have someone come over and start my pedicure. The water is cold, my ankles are itchy and someone who came in after me got their services started before me. Why even bother making an appointment? I won't be coming back.",1
"Wow, is this place for real. They need real cooks or chefs because the lunch we had was bad. Do not waste your money on this place. The staff is friendly, but a food establishment is in the business of food. I don't understand how this place is in business.",1
"If you want to impress a date, take them to Marcellino's. My first visit there was with a date, and I was definitely impressed. Your dining experience there will be private, personal and in a lovely atmosphere. As a diner, you will feel like everything is especially for you. and it is. Marcellino makes sure that your meal is worth savoring and that you will appreciate your evening enough to return.",2
"Me came here for NYE dinner 2013. This was our second go round from the previous NYE. Strip House was also a good choice because it is centrally located on the strip where all the NYE action was going down. n nSo, the good. The service was absolutely awesome. They waited on us hand and food. Loved the complimentary bread basket. That bad boy is as endless as you want it to be. Unfortunately, I think I ate one too many pretzel rolls. Oh well, the heck with it! The jury is still out on the food. The bone in rib eye was ok. There are definitely much better renditions in Vegas, which is steak house mania. Personally, I think N9NE and even THE Steak House in Circus Circus are better. Surprisingly, the lobster bisque was bland. This was disheartening to me as I love a good lobster bisque. We also order the Caesar salad which was delicious. n nThe bad Unfortunately, something we at here left us with a bad case of food poisoning. We know because this was the ONLY thing we ate all day. No bueno. n nSorry Strip House, you're officially off my Vegas ""A "" list. For now, N9NE steals the show. We'll have to see if Crafsteak or STRIPSTEAK take the crown.",1
"Oh the day after my Bday. I woke up not when I wanted and had a mild headache going, but the parents were in town so I hopped out of bed and was on time. n nMy mom loves coming here so this was an easy choice for me as well. The past few times we came here I notice we been ordering the same choice, All American BBQ Feast with some added ribs and Brisket. Every time we visit here the food is consistent as well as the service. This time around the highlights for me were the corn muffins, BBQ chicken, ribs, and Lemonade. The slaw had a little more liquid that normal but nothing major. n nWhen we came it was not that busy so we had excellent service and the manager even dropped in to check if everything was going good. All in all, it was a good Sunday meal.",2
