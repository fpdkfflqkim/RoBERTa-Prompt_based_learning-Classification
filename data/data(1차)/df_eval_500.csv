It was sub par. Expected better after reading these reviews. I'd rather get Pizza Hut.,1
"I was visiting vegas for the weekend and found some time to drop by this place. nParking is a hassle, but thats with any swap meet. entrance was about 1 2 bucks which was great. this place is huge, I didn't understand the layout but had enough booths to keep walking and walking. They serve beer, and it seems like people just come here to listen to music or the live DJ they have playing there. A bunch of different things to buy. Not really anything different from swap meets I usually go to. n nI did buy a butterfly knife and switch blade so THANK YOU LAS VEGAS!",2
"Lee's is one of the reasons I carry cash on hand. n nWhen my hubby and I first moved to Chandler, we would drive by Lee's all the time and always comment on how we'd love to try it because it's so damn bright and enticing. That was five years ago and we're hooked. We take everyone from out of town here to eat at least once. My Korean in laws ask to come here first thing when they visit from Guam. It's tasty and it's easy on the pocket book. Plus the soothing Asian voice announcing your order numbers is awesome. n nMy favorite is the 4 Grilled Chicken Vietnamese sandwich. I love the jalapenos, cilantro and daikon radish.gives it such a unique flavor. And the baguettes are awesome. They freshly make the bread right there in the store. It's perfection. n nThe croissant sandwiches are amazing as well. Big, buttery and delicious. n nI also recommend their smoothies with the boba beads in them. I don't know what the heck those little squishy balls hehehe are, but they are freaking addictive! n nAnd finally, get the cream filled pastries. They are heaven for your mouth.",2
"This place is awesome, the best sandwiches there are in the Valley! If you don't try it, you are missing out on something great! I promise you, you will love the food, the people and the place! n nI never know which sandwich to pick that is the hardest part! I have tried almost everyone of them and the food is the best around! Mark my words, you will be happy you went there! n nTell Jodi and Dave Jill ""aka the bratt "" sent you! ",2
"This is restaurant is undoubtedly understaffed. There were two employees at the front in charge of hosting, waiting, and busing all of the tables as well as managing phone orders. It was obvious they were stressed and continuously in a rush. Having one more employee working the front would make dining here flow significantly smoother. Based on the prices of the entrees, it seems management should be able to afford another server. n nThe prices for the Korean entrees are high. The menu items under Korean BBQ averaged about 30 per entree. In order to use the stoves at the table you need to order at least two of such entrees. Also, the BBQ portions are limited. In New York, I've seen Korean BBQ buffets for 30 per person, but never this much for just one portion of Bulgogi or Spare Ribs. The Korean non BBQ dishes average over 20 per entree. n nThe Japanese and Korean Chinese dishes were priced com the range of about 7 20 with different prices during lunch or dinner for certain items. n nI opted for the Ban Jai steak and shrimp . My only complaint was that the steak was well done otherwise, the shrimp and mushrooms were good. The Nam Jai is a bento box which also came with fried dumplings, fried rice, crab sticks, kimchi, and cucumber carrot salad. I thought all of the sides except the crabmeat were very good. n nI think Korea Garden has some of the best Asian good on Oakland. I would certainly return for a different bento box! n nOh, and paper towels are located outside the restrooms.",2
"Tivoli Village is beautiful! This is the perfect place for a day of shopping and lunch with friends. They have the casual restaurants and the more upscale as well. The shops range from high end boutiques to inexpensive retailers. Charming Charlies is my newest fave for costume jewelry! The parking area is immaculate and easy to navigate. The decor is very upscale, kind of like an upgraded Town Square. If they built a MAC or Sephora here, I would swear off Town Square altogether.",2
"The older reviews here are lower than the more recent ones, and apparently they changed something, because I was pleasantly surprised by the cakes I received and I'm not easily impressed by miniature baked goods. n nAs Dana details in her review, the gimmick this place has that other bakeries don't is that you customize your order the cake flavor, the filling, and or the frosting, from several appealing choices. They also have a list of 20 odd suggested combinations with cutesy names. n nCakes I've tried here were decently moist and not too sweet, frosting is sugary but also has strong flavors the peanut butter here is a favorite among many places I've tried it. PB and coffee are my usual flavors of choice, keep meaning to try the snicker doodle and carrot cake.",2
"Seriously the worst one I've ever been to. You'll get asked for change multiple times before you even get inside. Not one of the shopping carts will roll smoothly. They all have huge chunks missing from the wheels. Every time I've asked for help finding something, I've never had anyone actually TRY to help. There are always huge long lines and I've never seen more than 5 registers open at one time. Once you get to the front of the line, the cashiers are unfriendly. The management staff obviously doesn't care and is also unhelpful. I've witnessed fights in line between customers. This Wal Mart is awful! I avoid it at all costs. But sometimes I have to brave it and walk in with my head hung in shame and defeat weighing heavy in my heart. Here goes an hour in line to buy 3 items.",1
"I have a border collie who was a rescue, she had been abused and neglected. She had never been groomed and I selected this shop after reading LOTS of reviews. ""Cassie "" took a lot of time with her and she was not traumatized at all . she actually had that ""happy dog "" look on her face when I picked her up and ""Cassie "" always does a fantastic job! I have had her groomed twice by ""Cassie "" and both times I was extremely satisfied and happy with the result. Unfortunately, when I called a few days ago to get her groomed for the summer, I was told my groomer ""Cassie "" was no longer there and no one is offering information as to where she went . Can anyone please help me find ""Cassie ""? Please email at rhodgman cox.net",2
Only Pepsi products? No!,1
"If you have 10 15 minutes to kill, take a look at this new shopping area. n nIt has beautiful architectural design, but with only the first phase opening, they are somewhat limited on retail and dining options. n nIf you want to dine with friends, try a little later in the evening, say after 7, to find an available table.older crowd is usually there in the early evening. n nThis place will be incredible once the recession improves and future phases begin to open.",1
"We got a good price on a midsized car at this location, even without a reservation. n nIn Vegas they make it very easy to rent a car. They have a shuttle that picks you up from the airport and drive you to this RentACar utopia. From there you just walk up to the counter, give them your deposit, they hand you the keys to your rental car and you walk to a parking structure where you find your car. Very easy! n nDropping off is just as easy too! n nNext time I am in Vegas I will be renting from them again.",2
"Oh man, I love the Taco Truck. I stalk them regularly on twitter and Instagram for daily menus and their current location, which they are great about sharing. Most often, I'll visit the truck at The Coffee Buddha in Perrysville because it's not too far from home. They always have at least one veggie option, and it's always mouth watering! And cheap! To date we've tried the black bean tacos and the curried potato tacos my favorite! , but they also have a tofu taco on occasion and a samosa type choice which I'm desperate to try. I'll have to keep stalking I guess! nThe turn around has always been quick considering the quality of the product. The ingredients are incredibly fresh and high quality. They even offer vegan cheese and I believe all tacos are 100 gluten free! Bonus! nI look forward to PGH Taco Truck Wednesday's at The Coffee Buddha. They've been branching out location wise recently, so look for them near you soon! I wonder if I can convince them to park outside of my house for a few hours?",2
"This is the first and last time I will ever go there. The food was mediocre at best. The woman behind the counter, who I'm assuming is the owner or manager, was a complete b tch. I asked for a regular cup for water and she told the kid ringing me up to charge me full price. I do not drink out of styrofoam so I just went without a drink. n nThere are way too many choices for lunch in Ballantyne.with better food and nicer staff.",1
"Never again. My daughter and I wanted to get a fun pedi before we left for a trip to Disney. We decided we would get matching Mickey Mouse heads on our big toes. I picked this place because I saw that they had chairs for kids, but my daughter wasn't even offered a seat in them. The spa pedis were decent and competitively priced for the area, but the paint job was absolutely atrocious. I should have known when they asked what design we wanted and I said Mickey Mouse heads and all we got in response were blank stares from the technicians. They really had no idea what we meant. So, I quickly did a search on my smart phone for an idea to show them. When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, ""Ah, easy! "" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn't pay for a manicure here! My daughter's nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay not great, so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the 'mickey' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one. I will never be back.",1
"Can't believe no one has written a review for this very nice little comic shop. n nWas waiting for a minigolf place to open up and figured I would digest my sandwich while browsing through the latest. well, latest is not the word to use here, items that this place had to offer. n nWas I surprised that this little hole in the wall had a lot of variety. A lot of comic and nerdy stuff that even hardcore nerds themselves would call. ""very nerdy "". I'm talkin' bout getting into the hardcore of the hardcore here. n nWant to know what they have? A wide selection of Star Trek costumes. So I suppose if you're in town for a sci fi convention or you're missing that experience that once came from the Star Trek experience at the Hilton, you can always hit up this place and get your paid escort a star trek skirt. n nThe best thing about this place is the wide selection of Doctor Who items. It's like you got your passport stamped and headed over the pond to England. They have a lot of stuff Dr. Who related. n nI mean. not even hard core nerds in the states really embrace Dr. Who all that much cause, really, it's Doctor Who. That's like a British thing. But man oh man, do I love it! NERD ME UP! n nSo yeah, they have a ton of selection in the realm of Scifi and this nerd just couldn't get enough of it! n nAs for comic selection, they had a good number of stuff. While the other shops in Vegas were better for back issues and hardcover tpb, this one was great for the random collectible items and various toys and stuff. n nVery helpful in answering questions. Though you could smell that desperation in the air. The asking you one too many times if you need help finding anything. HA! Like any respectable comic shop worker knows what the store actually has hidden in their shelves. n nThat's how you can tell the good ones. cause not even they know what hidden treasures they have in their joint. Just a collection that piles on top of itself over the years. n nThanks anyhow, and thanks for my green lantern glass.",2
My husband and I ate here yesterday and we were pleasantly surprised! The food was very fresh and delicious. Portions and prices are decent. We will probably eat here again.,2
"From the reviews I thought this was going to be a great experience. I was at work looking at yelp for food ideas and this place looked good. Normally I go to Archi's or I go to Satay but this is closer to me. So I place my order for panang curry w beef in the lunch special and get an egg roll and wow it was only 6.55. I get there and the place looks somewhat raggedy but the woman at the front desk was super friendly. I get my food, awkwardly she doesn't give me change but I make my way back to the office. Here's where the issues begin. n nThe serving size of the curry was so small. Like not just lunch special small but like ""am I really supposed to get full from this small "". I ordered a spice level 5 on a scale from 1 10 and it was like an 8. I can handle spice and I like spice but that was excessive since I wasn't expecting it. The beef was akin to beef jerky and was boiled with 0 flavor. At Satay they have shredded beef integrated into the panang to give it a different texture and and great flavor. This tasted like nothing. The curry was ok in flavor but very soupy. The egg roll was random in flavor with no appetizing dipping sauce. The fake sweet chili sauce had vinegar weird . Overall I had a flavor profile in my head that this didn't meet and I was still hungry. Blah",1
"What better way to cure a hangover with some good ol' greasy burgers! These are not your normal burgers, as i honestly think I ate the BEST burger here. I ordered a burger that has kobe beef. Kobe beef is too gooood. n nOther than the food, We did not have reservations, but it was not packed so we waited around 5 minutes. nService was good. nPre meal was some flavored popcorn. Personally i hate popcorn, it gets stuck in my teeth, so it was AITEE. nAmbiance is modern, i mean you are eating in the cosmo haha. n nRelooking at the menu, I kinda wish i got a milkshake. They all sound really fricking delish.",2
"What happened!? I came here with my mom about a week after they opened and the food was fresh and yummy and the service was amazing! Not sure what her name was but she was friendly and we had some great convo with her. Since our first visit went so well we decided to come here again for my 21st birthday. Our waiter Jonathan spanish guy was terrible he didn't have a warm personality, he barely spoke to us. no small talk or anything. He didn't get us any water. When he brought out the food he dropped it and left without a word. I wanted barbecue sauce and my mom wanted water. I ended up asking the bartender for it since Jonathan went m.i.a. He didn't ask us if everything tasted good or if we needed anything. I've never had a waiter that bad before. He ruined my birthday lunch! n n nP.S. When I had the ribs my first visit, they were hot and fresh this visit we could tell they had been made before hand. like WAY before hand and my mom's mashed potatoes were extremely dry. I guess since there settled in they don't think they have to work as hard?.",1
"I will NEVER go back to this hotel! You will have your money and things stolen! Both experiences were a nightmare. Took my best friend to vegas for her birthday. We paid in advance for a double queen. When we arrived we got a single king. They claimed they were out of double queen rooms. Went out that night and the next morning was getting ready. The do not disturb sign was on the door. The maid was BANGING on the door to let her in. My friend was in a towel and I was in my bra and underwear. My friend opened the door a little just to tell the maid to wait and she busted in! Im frantically trying to find clothes. She does something to the phone and leaves. She says she'll be back in 15 minutes! Sure enough, she comes back. Doesn't even knock this time. Uses her card, slams through the door and does something again to the phone. She proceeds to tell us to hurry so she can clean the room by 4 30 it's only 12 00pm . 30 minutes later we leave and call across the hall we are leaving. We return to our room at 5pm and the room is not clean. We call the front desk and they claim to have sent someone. 2 hours later my friend and I leave for dinner. Still no maid service. I go downstairs and speak to a manager and she gives me a 10 food credit for my troubles. Oh wow I ask for a late check out instead. She agreed. The room finally gets cleaned by 11pm. So helpful considering we leave the next morning sarcasm . My purse is hidden the entire time I am in and out of the room the entire weekend. Two weeks later I am fraudulently charged 1,000 to 2 separate accounts! These charges are made to phone, cable, and energy bills in Las Vegas! Also, my 150 curling iron was stolen. Hope the b ch gets arrested. And she will.also, our room smelled entirely of weed and the sink clogged every time it was used.",1
"Went here for my birthday! Celebrated the last year of my twenties with the best buffet I've ever had not just in Vegas. n nDinner starts at 4PM and is only 39. For 7 more, you can get all you can drink champagne! Score! n n clean and well lit n really nice ambiance with tall flower displays n pre split Alaskan king crab and chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, and melted butter n succulent prime rib carved to your liking with creamy horseradish and au jus, awesome, buttery mashed potatoes, and caesar salad n butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce and pesto gnocchi n charcuterie and cheese n spicy panang with naan bread n a WHOLE BRIGHT AND SHINY ROOM just for desserts including red velvet cupcakes with gold glitter, mini churro like donuts, chocolate covered marshmallows, raspberry mousse, and the BEST creamiest, vanilla est vanilla bean creme brule ever cue drool n nAnd that's just the stuff I ate. There was also sushi, salmon, sea bass, lamb, veal, creamy soups, really cute little salads, made to order pastas, roasted chicken, pizza, ice cream, bread pudding, and made to order crepes. n n mouthful ",2
"your pumps suck! nslow! slow! slow! nnot only are they slow but 1 2 the time they aren't working properly! n neven though your location makes it easiest for me to get gas from my house, i'll start leaving early to go to the chevron across the street! n nyour pumps suck! you have officially lost this customer!",1
I called this morning and FIRST asked what your shop hourly rate is ? The polite response was 90 hour. I was not thinking it would be the same as legal fee's or a doctor's office hourly rate ? Last I checked these professions required 6 8 years of college education and strict legal boards in order to acquire the license to practice. Not to mention insurance as well as staff payroll. So without wasting anyone's time I suggest the first question you ask any auto repair shop is what is your hourly rate ?,1
"My wife and I have been here twice now and each time the subs were delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Plus, cheese curds! My favorite sub so far was the Philly cheesesteak. Great customer service too!",2
"This staff here is nice but incompetent, my son is 4 and almost had to be removed from School because he didn't have all his shots, Wee Care is where we got all his shots and apparently they skipped a few shots when he was 1yo because they were out of them and never notified me or had us reschedule. So now i had to my son to get poked for vaccines for illnesses that he out grew. Also when my son was getting his shots the person who gave him his shot was sick that day and sneezed into his arm LITERALLY before he gave my son his shot. If you're sick you shouldn't be at a pediatrician's office where kids go to get better",1
"I now see my daughter and I are not the only ones to receive bad service here. So sad since this place had the potential of being a real find. My daughter and I went here on a girls day out. We were at first excited to see the display case full of beautiful looking desserts. I had creme brulee. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered this chocolate shell tart with what was described as a white chocolate filling. It did not taste like white chocolate at all and it actually had the texture of Crisco shortening. Yes shortening! Not at all what you want in a dessert.My daughter took one bite and put it down. I tasted it to see if it really was as bad as she said and I had to agree. No problem. I told my daughter ""I am sure when the server comes back they will let you exchange it "". When the server came back she only said ""Oh I am sorry you did not like it "" and took it away. She came back with the bill with both desserts on it. She never asked us if we would like to exchange for something else. When I looked at the bill I said my daughter did not like her dessert could she have something else? She said she would have to ""add it to my tickett "". I told her it was not polite for her to ask us to pay for a dessert that clearly she only took one bite of because it was not good. She said it was policy to not take things off the bill just because someon did not like it. So.just like other reviews here I will not be back. If the customer does not like it. They don't like it. If they think you are rude and have terrible manners they won't be back.Your service always has to be as good as your food! If you don't even have good service you have nothing! You lose! nNot a new concept.",1
"Took the family here for Thanksgiving. n nWhat the food lacks, the location and view make up for. The food and thanksgiving buffet were good, not stunning, but, good. I feel the price was a bit high, but, overall acceptable. n nNow would I choose this restaurant to go for the food, no. But, to take someone and showcase the city, have a great social time. absolutely.",2
"My wife took our '89 truck for a smog check. They had her wait inside, then told her that it failed for visible smoke, and that they would call her with an estimate for repair. n The next day, they called and quoted us 800 for the part and 12 hours of labor. I called my usual mechanic Aamco on Valley View , who told me it was an outrageous quote. They asked me to pick up the part at Autozone cost of 8 , and bring the truck in to their shop. I did so, and the mechanic sadly the name escapes me , showed me how to install in, which I did in roughly 1 min. The kicker? No visible smoke. n Don't take your car here unless you want to be lied to. They literally tried to swindle me for over 700.",1
"100 prettiest, fanciest place i've ever seen in my life. absolutely breathtaking. from the lobby with rock features and waterfall, to the lit up painted ceiling, to the enormous pools that overlook golf courses and lakes as well as wide 360 views of the surrounding mountains, etc. just. wow. even the stairs have little decorations as big as my head. a random pot of flowers sitting in a corner was twice as tall as me. i felt like a little ant.",2
"Coming from Tucson, this is about the nicest dog park I have ever seen. Spacious and grassy such a concept! with ample parking right outside the dog park. We've been going here for about 6 mo. now and I would generalize the owners here as responsible with their pets and the cleanup. Sure, there can be some outliers, but I always feel relaxed having my dogs here. n nWhen the big dog park floods out how hard it is for the city to just put in a drain, I don't understand , everyone goes to the small dog park and I've never seen an issue or even a concerned small dog owner face. I can be a bit of a pain with traffic, as the parking is only off of 7th St, but otherwise there is no reason to pick anywhere else.",2
"I was going to give five until I tasted my friends eggplant parm, not what I would expect. The sauce was bland. But that aside, the pizza here brought me back to the East coast, same crust, they even bring in the water to make the dough. This is the pizza I know and love, bend in half and shove into mouth, trying not to burn off the skin on the roof of your mouth. I highly recommend this place to every one. Oh, and I tried their signature beer and that rocked as well.",2
"Hope, the waitress made it 4 stars for us! Sopapias are amazing! Cheese enchilada is good. Don't get the chile releno. Yuk! Salsa is good. Chips need to have the oil changed before they are fried. Overall the experience we mediocre however the waitress named Hope made it great with her customer service!",2
"True Japanese food! Very fresh fish and authentic preparation. Will definitely do well, I know I'll be back!",2
"The mini desserts from this place that M Resort Studio Buffet serves are pretty good so I decided to try a cupcake from this place. I got the Coconut Pineapple one and what a HUGE disappoinment. The frosting didn't even taste like frosting but something artificial. In fact, I can make better cupcakes. n nNeedless to say will not be buying from here again.",1
"My experience here was pretty straightforward. I was rear ended and came here to get repairs based on Liberty Mutual's recommendation as they are near my work. I came in for an appraisal first, as it was the other parties fault I wanted to make sure I wasn't paying anything out of pocket. They never pressured me in any way and once a check was cut, I brought my car back in and they did everything for me. They called Enterprise for me to pick me up at the shop, and they finished everything on the day they estimated to be finished. They communicated everything to my insurance company and I never needed to call anyone. When my car was ready I dropped the rental car off at the shop and they arranged for Enterprise to come pick it up and I was able to drive home in my car within less than 10 minutes of arriving. Not only that but they detailed my car, washed and vacuumed and it looked great. Everyone was very helpful, patient, and friendly. I loved the atmosphere of the waiting area. I've been to repair shops where the customer area is junky and gross, you feel uneasy and it smells like grease with maybe one chair. Their customer area is a nice size, EXTREMELY clean, has a TV in the corner, water and coffee available, it smells good, and all the employees are clean cut and approachable. I would highly recommend them to anyone.",2
"This place is great. Had my completely shattered phone screen fixed in half an hour, my phone literally looks brand new. As far as I'm concerned, there is no other place to go if you need a phone repaired. Thanks uBreakiFix!",2
Food was gross and the bowl was half empty.,1
"I like this place. The owner really does his best to make people feel comfortable. The place isn't exactly the best with two seats and not exactly modern place, but somehow that just seems to be where the best barbers are. He really takes pride and care in his work, which ended up having a much longer haircut than I've normally had. n nSo in conclusion, the place may not look the best, but it's definitely a top notch barber. Hard to believe I've found a new one so fast.",2
Always greeted with a SMILE and a HUG ! n nGreat Food! Great Service! n nGreat family owned restaurant that really cares about their customers. They remember their regulars by name and ask about your family members or friends. n nAlways fresh ingredients and no msg. Always consistently delicious!,2
"Poor service mediocre service. nWe went because they had Ahi on the menu trying to keep on WW plan . We ordered our entrees, and the black bean dip yes, ignoring the fact there is probably gobs of cheese in it . We asked if we can have some cut up veggies with it aside . The waiter had to go ask, then telling us it would be additional 3 seriously? . After we receive the dip and gold plated zucinni slices, the waiter came back to tell us they are out of Ahi. So is asked if I can replace the fries with the brussel sprout side on the steak frites dinner . ""No, but you can sub the fries with more salad "". So we had to order the sprouts on the side. The Steak came out cooked nicely, but it would had been nice if they'd seasoned the steak . even the chimichuri was bland. Very very disappointed!",1
I love going to this Paradise Bakery location at 12th street and Glendale. The staff there is excellent and the food is wonderful. My favorite dish is the steak and blue cheese salad,2
We stopped into Backstage Bar because my friend wanted to check it out and PENN from Penn and Teller was perfoming w his band.Which was kinda cool the band was ok and no cover charge which is a The bar staff was friendly but slow and didnt know if they had specials.Which I feel if you work at the bar you should know this or at least try to recommend me something like a special drink you are known for something etc. The decor is cool all styled after music road gear cases which is cool even the bar is set up like that very cool but They need more seating I am not going to go into a bar w my g f and stand shes going to want to leave. also I guess they had pool but no signage w pricing or how you get a table etc.Also everyone was sitting on them maybe only 30 people inside the place. It was a good atmosphere and chill spot just barstaff needs to get more informative and know how to sell and suggest drinks hence why everyone is drinking PBR cause its cheap and no suggestions or other deals! Overall kinda cool spot just need to work on customer service,2
"This was my review. nWow, worst food at a sandwich place. I ordred a plain Roast beef with mayo and got old beef sawdust on a stale bun. I like Cap pretty much. This location is the dregs. They should be ashamed to be open. I usually do not write to a company to complain but I made a exception in this case. I hope they listen. Avoid this location at all costs. I think it may be one bad apple, but it can rot the bunch. Never rated the other locations I have been to, just took for granted that they had good food. n nReceived this reply from Mr, Thomas Mulconey of Capriottis. Thought it would be the right thing to share and let everyone know that it was a timely and humble response. I admire and appreciate Mr. Mulconey for taking responsibility and not making excuses for the problem. I will take him up on his offer very soon and will review this location again. n nRonald n nHello Ronald, I would like to introduce myself, my name is Thomas Mulconrey.

"I love Chloe's. I almost make a daily appearance, whether it's for coffee, baked goodies, my favorite smoked turkey sandwich or a quick afternoon snack. A great place for morning coffee meetings with tables in a nice open space and decent patio as far as patios in downtown Phoenix go. SUPER friendly staff and still fairly speedy service even during lunch rush hour. There's a Starbucks a few doors down, but if you choose them over Chloe's, I will be personally offended.",2
"My service here was excellent, and the drinks were delicious. While I thought the my choice was decent my dinner companion found her entree to be delicious. She got the seafood combination with Swordfish and Salmon. I only tried the Swordfish and it was moist, tender, and quite delectable. Top Sirloin cooked medium with mashed potatoes and a vegetable medley of carrots, and green beans with a peppered season was my selection. The vegetable medley was delicious, potatoes were quite underwhelming, and the steak was nothing to write home about. It was cooked perfectly, but much to my chagrin there was no seasoning or even a nice salt rub to it. I don't need an overloaded flavorful steak, but this one had no extra effort put into it. Disappointment wasn't what I was feeling, it was more emptiness. Next time I think I'll opt for the Dry Rubbed Rib eye. We also chose the Creme Brulee, which was creamy and smooth with an awesome thick, crispy caramelized layer. n nOne thing that impresses me the most is McCormick and Schmick's free menu for those that have honorably served our country Veteran's Day weekend. I would have rated them 3 stars, but this boosted them up to 4 stars for their respect for service members.",2

"OK n nWe went there on a Groupon after taking the kid to the strip and playing tourist. n nI know when a server see's 4 kids and 2 adults in their section they sometimes aren't so happy. n nBut the service was HORRIBLE. We waited a long time to order, we watched her take care of a table next to us and pretty much ignored us. The food wasn't that good either. nIt takes a lot for me to complain and I hit my limit. n nWe talked to a manager and she either was overwhelmed with complaints or just didn't care. Either way her immediate response was to take 20 off the bill. n nI always leave a tip but this experience was so bad, for the first time, I didn't leave a penny. n nIts a shame, the patio is really cool and the location isn't too bad although its a little confusing going through the casino. n nIt seems like the restaurant is an afterthought. Their other business is the exotic car business which is adjacent to the restaurant. You can rent a Ferrari for an hour n nDo yourself a favor and skip this place even if they have a great Groupon deal.",1
"We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place. However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently. We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain . This employee could not help us either as ""he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know want to have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it. "" I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and sorry hickish about these ""stupid "" machines. After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services. Eek felt like we dodged a bullet. Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services. I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there.",1
I came to elephant bar with my friends for dinner. Was a hoping place to be for a Saturday night. Our server vince was busy as the outside area was full but took the time to make us laugh and have a good time. Food was excellent and service was awesome. I'll be back and my friends will too.,2
