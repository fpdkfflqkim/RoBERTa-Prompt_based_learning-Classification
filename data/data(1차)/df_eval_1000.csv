"Went here once for dinner last year and never will again. The food and drink that I did eventually have were excellent. However, our server was THE WORST that I have ever encountered. We were seated and ignored for approximately 30 mins before our server came over and jokingly said he was sorry for the wait even though the place was ""pretty dead "". I am convinced he was either high or drunk because he could not tell us what the specials were and would stare off or wander away from our table in mid sentence. I would have left sooner if my date had not convinced me to say and we weren't so hungry. Just got drinks an hour into being there. When he was finally able to take our order, the food came out quickly and we ate it quickly since we had by now been there about an hour and a half. I was so upset after this that I wrote an email detailing the experience to the owner. He didn't seem too surprised or apologetic. I was offered a free round of drinks next time I came in which is insulting and ridiculous. What part of ""I am never coming back here again "" didn't you get?",1
Most of the beers on the menu that are supposed to be Belgian really aren't. There is no Blue Moon in Belgium or Northcoast brewery. And there are several more mistakes. They should get their act together and don't lie about the origins of their beers. There is no substitute for the real thing.,1
I made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 6 14 14 to have a relaxing Day but they gave me a stressful week. It was a really nice place. i was planning to go again but not anymore. nI was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too. I think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization. I received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes.,1
Not a bad chicken dinner for a business event. Up charge on cocktails is reasonable for non members. Excellent grounds. Nice old school style.,2
"An update to this review. After all this happened, the event organizers complained to the corporate office. n nApparently, the follow up to this was that the manager who was leading the charge on doing this was fired. n nGood riddance.",1
"The crab cakes are the best outside of Maryland! n nThey are all crab, real blue crab, not that stuff spelled with a ""k "". And there's no filler either. They also have great crab soup and crab dip. The sliders were excellent as well. n nEvery time I visit the Phoenix area, this is one of my stops. It might not be the fanciest of places, but you will get some of the best food and some of the coldest beer I have found in AZ. The people working there are some of the nicest around. n nAlso, I love that the woman behind the bar calls me ""Hun "". Makes me miss the east coast. n nOh yeah, if you like whole blue crab, you can get on their email list, they let you know when they get them in fresh!",2
"On the suggestion of a friend who thinks this is close to authentic Mexican, we went on a Sunday evening. The service was slow that evening and had some communication problems. We ordered their fresh guacamole which was very good.enough for 2 3 people. We ordered a classic margarita special 3 and ordered a no carb margarita. Very dissappointed with the no carb and then shocked that it was 11! Total rip off. We ordered 4 entrees, steak faijtas and 3 burritos dishes. The entrees were just ok. Burritos had a lot of rice and beans.maybe too much. Some of the meat was a little dry. Nothing on this visit would compel me to return.",1
"i tried to buy a car from them, spoke with them several times about the car , it was a 2012 750i bmw, market price. they wanted me badly to pay a deposit eventhough i said i will be there tomorrow . it felt fishy when they also wanted me to wire the money immediately, so i checked carfax and i was shocked to know that carfax stated that the car is A LEMON. i was really unhappy about that and couldn't believe it . they responded by saying . "" we told you it was a dealer repurchase "". ha !? dealer repurchase means that it came from a lease NOT A LEMON. . i lost my ticket money. so i personally won't deal with these ppl at all.",1

"Not the best mariscos.portions are small. I got the breaded shrimp and they had no flavor or seasonings.very disappointed, will never come back.Everyone was telling me about this seafood restaurant how it's the best .i was very disappointed, it's ok cause i wont be back.the music is so loud .i really don't understand why it's so loud, what's up w that, how am i supposed to carry a conversation .so i had to wait for music to stop, it was soooooo annoying .NEVER AGAIN.",1
"This place is a dump, I got tricked into the beautiful sign for the breakfast buffet. NONE of the items on the picture were offered. It was the worst powdered eggs, greasy sausage, premade danishes, unripe fruit. I was grossed out. nI'm not kidding I've had better continental breakfasts for free at motels. nNot only was the food sickening, the 'chefs' were yelling and cussing to each other behind the syrup danish area I could see one, not the other . nI like Bally's and this place is a real disappointment. Even Imperial Palace Quad has Hash House a go go. At least tear this place out and put a Denny's in.",1
"Great service to and from the airport. Will use for future visits. We used both the stretch limo and the SUV. VIP service is great with a large party. Timely, friendly and helpful drivers.",2
"the signs are in the wrong spots, the aisles are narrow in most areas and way to wide in one or two. I can forgive all this, except for the lack of organization on where the items are. there is a problem if I spend 45mins finding salt.",1
"If you're trying to decide on a place for ramen, and you've ever dined at Ippudo, Naruto, Minca, or Totto in NYC and thought they had good to fantastic ramen, you will NOT like Republic. n nI ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with pork you get a choice of meat and an egg, and a lychee green tea with boba. The ramen was not complex at all, and really just tasted like salt. And the noodles looked and felt and tasted packaged, sooo not worth the calories tasty at all! The pork was tough and chewy and not tender at all, and there were so many fatty bits that were inedible that I wish I had opted for tofu. I liked the spinach, which was out of place but flavorful. n nThe bubble tea was AWFUL for the first few sips, which alternated between bitter and chemical sweet, but after I let it sit for 15 minutes it was better. The boba were a little too hard dry on the inside, but it was towards the end of the day so maybe they were just sitting around for a while? Considering how hard it is to find boba around this town, I'm not complaining I would go back and try another flavor, but I wouldn't have high expectations. n nLook, if you want soup with noodles, this place will do. But if you want RAMEN, with rich, complex broth that isn't overly salty, with tender pork and handmade noodles, I would skip this place. With enough hot sauce, it was definitely edible, but it wasn't what I was craving since I was craving ramen .and so I am disappointed.",1
One of my favorite local places to catch dinner with the kids. Everything we have had has been great and the wait staff is always helpful. Love the large beer selection. Its kind of loud so don't go expecting a quiet night out. I,2
"Anna, The Taylor, is fabulous. She can help you out in a pinch and does great work. Not sure of the dry cleaning thogh. n nTaylor gets a 5 star from me.",2
"Wine Selection was good, no Moscato but the Riesling was another good choice. Other reviewers were spot on with the generous pour! nThe location was easy to find and the bar was very nicely done. My friend and I even ordered the Cheese and Fruit plate, which was nothing extraordinary as far as cheeses go, but it was chilled and the fruit was fresh. nUnder normal circumstances I wouldn't write any review unless I had something nice to say, but all of these positives were outweighed by an unfriendly employee. nI was here for a ""Vino and Canvas "" event which is a LOT of fun so we got there early, ordered our wine and food, paid at the bar, and meandered into the little room set aside for our event. The young lady at the bar was taciturn and unhelpful we just assumed it was nothing personal and she was just busy but the gentleman there was helpful as far as wine goes, even letting me have a taste to be sure what I wanted to order. Neither of them checked on our group during the two hour event, but this is understandable considering they were pretty busy for a Sunday afternoon. As we were leaving though, the young lady at the bar stopped my friend and told her she still had to pay. My friend reminded her that we had paid and had even asked her to change a 20 bill when she returned with our change from the tab. She insisted that the tab was not closed out and my friend still owed her money. She was rude and confrontational and left a bad taste in our mouths after an event that was otherwise incredibly fun. I try to be understanding because I have worked in retail, but there is a way to approach a situation like this without getting nasty about it. It's possible she was just having a bad day but first impressions really do make a difference. nI would definitely do another of these events but my friend and I will think twice if it is being held here. There are many nice wine bars in the Phoenix Scottsdale area, I see no need to go to one with unfriendly staff.",1
"Talk about a bummer. My last and only trip to this restaurant is one of those horrendous dining experiences you get once in a blue moon. nMy boyfriend and I went here for our year and a half anniversary. Not a big deal, but we're broke college kids and don't get to go out for fancy dinners often. At other restaurants within the chain, I've gotten clam linguine and it's my favorite thing ever. On this particular night, the only form of this linguine was in some two plate special. This strange setup allowed you to receive two of the same entree with a salad or appetizer, or something like that. I think ""get one to go "" was the theory. However, I decided I didn't need all that and the price tag was pretty shocking. When our waiter came and asked for our food order, I asked if there was some way to just get one plate of the linguine. ""I'll see. I'm sure we can. What do you want if not? "" ""Um.I don't know. Maybe a caesar salad. Actually, maybe not. I'll have to think about it. "" With that our server left. I kept waiting for him to return with the status of my linguine. He briefly breezed by quick enough to refill our water and ask what the capitol of Maine was which was weird It's Augusta, by the way . And was off before I could even ask about our food. A few minutes later, he presented me with a salad. So I assumed they couldn't split the linguine order. Which I thought would be a fairly simple task. nEven worse, the salad which I didn't really want, anyway, I thought I made that clear sucked. There's a couple of things I don't understand how you screw up. If you're an Italian restaurant and you can't make a caesar salad, a staple of Italian dining, something's wrong. Heck, even Zaxby's has a caesaer salad that tastes better and is almost half the price. n nAs a customer, it's obnoxious when you can't get what you want. I understand that companies have rules and procedures. However, I've also worked at a restaurant before and usually minor alterations to a meal aren't even an issue. nFurthermore, when you don't give your server a definitive order on something, he just kind of brings something out, that is outrageous. Anyway, I'll stop ranting. I just think even the one star is generous.",1
"A friend of mine invited us out to dinner here. We ordered the calamari, the fondue, the Monte Cristo, the short ribs, the Lotso Matzoh, and a few other things I didn't try. The Monte Cristo was the only thing I enjoyed and credit where credit's due, it was fantastic. If that had been the only thing I'd ordered, I'd have given four stars. My wife said that the short rib meat was OK, but the sauce was burned. The calamari was so heavily breaded and soggy that it was just gross. n nDon't think I'll be going back.",1

Not sure if this is like this always but the last few times I've been here it was almost enough to make me ralph.",2
"Sucks that this place was how we started our vacation off. nWe had an early flight, so by the time we made it to our layover, we were pretty hungry. We didn't have much time so we thought some tacos and burritos would hit the spot. nWrong. n nNot only was this place was pricey, you barely get any food. A tiny scoop of rice and beans, and 3 small tacos that looked miserable. I ate 1 taco before the corn tortilla fell apart. I dumped the other 2 and just ate the rice and beans. n nIt was also super packed and crowded, with barely a place to stand. Don't get your hopes up of finding a chair to sit in. n nLuckily we were heading to Texas, where they have the best tacos around, so we could easily forget our experience here.",1
Place was gross. Their menu didn't have enough description. Matter of fact it had no description just pictures. I order a waffle sand which well it turned out it had some kind of jelly in it. Really gross. Just threw it away and walked out. Won't be coming here anymore.,1
The airport is bigger than it looks from the outside. Fast check in at the ticket counter and pretty seamless through the gate. All the employees seemed in a good mood. n nThere are lots of places to sit and relax before your flight. Definitely use the moving sidewalks.especially if you are flying out of Gate E. Be prepared to walk a while to get there. n nThe baggage claim area has a good system going as long as you familiarize yourself with the zones. You can also easily tell the person that picks you up which zone you'll be at on the outside. n nConvenient and organized airport! Yay CLT!,2
"We wen't to Lake Las Vegas for a romantic weekend. They have jazz on Saturday night so we decided to go to a place that was near it. We walked around and looked at all the menus and Sunset and Vine's menu just stood out above the rest n nWe were greeted by a very friendly hostress. We asked if we could have a table outside. We orginally sat in the uncovered area but they let some asswipe smoker sit next to us who lit up and his cigarette smoke was blowing right at us. I thought you couldn't smoke were food was served in this state. We asked the server if we could move and he was very accomodating, I think we moved outside of his section but he still kept us. He was very nice, very upbeat. They sat us a table in the outside area that was covered. We could still hear the jazz and the scenery was just perfect. So tranquil. n nTheir small bites menu was perfect for what we wanted. n nMy gf had the chopped salad, portobello mushroom and the sweet potato fries. I had the pork belly mmmmm , the lamb chops. n nThe portobello mushroom was amazing. The sweet potato fries, honestly were some of the best we ever had, and the sauces with them, delicious. nMy lamb chops were good. They were the t bone cut and hard to get the meat out of but worth the effort. The Pork Belly, amazing! The skin was nice and crispy and the meat was so tender. My gf asked me if i needed an moment alone to enjoy it.lol n nI had a glass of wine and it was a nice fat pour for the money. n nEverything was great. n n nI would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the asswipe smoker. n nI would go back to this place in a NY minute!",2
Just got my brand new ring back today from being resized and it is now missing a diamond and is dirty. Poor customer service. I waited 30 minutes to pick up my ring and noticed and had to wait another 30 minutes to get it sent back in. 'Hope' the customer service person tried to give me a different ring size 7 not my size . The whole reason I came to this location is to get it resized for a smaller size. Why would I take a bigger ring?! Not satisfied and I would never recommend Zales to my family or friends.,1
"Argg. bright lights! I'm a cute fuzzy mogwai, keep me away from bright lights. And don't you know that loud music which goes 'boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.' turns me into a gremlin? nOk so it was a saturday night, and you're gonna struggle to get a quiet pint, but it just doesn't suit this pub. It's caught in total limbo land. 'Am I traditional ye olde. am I up market. am I banging weekend? Oh I really don't know anymore, I'm so confused. What should I wear? Quick it's saturday night, someone put ITV on the big screen and crank the beats!' nThey handed me my change on a silver saucer. Why? It's just not in keeping with anything else here. except maybe the huge ornate gold frame around the TV! Perhaps a trip to the toilets would have been a revelation. tanned, flower clad hula girls unconditionally handing me paper towels on a silver saucer. nOf course, it could be a lot worse, my pint was reasonaly priced and the clientele were ok. And maybe during the week it has more to offer, but barring mild irritaion, it didn't do anything for me on this occasion.",1
"As the newest location, one is led to think that the nice, modern decor and friendly atmosphere are up to par with their flagship restaurant located on I 17 and Cactus, however, after having experiencing one dine in with my family, it quickly became apparent that the phony smiles were merely a rouse for an over compensating and all too eager to get you out of their restaurant staff. n nFrom the moment we sat down we felt rushed. We had very little time to decide on drinks, never mind browsing the fairly large menu for what we all wanted to order. It was only after shooing away the waitress four times that we were able to reach a decision as to what we wanted to eat and placed our order. n nAfter what felt like an eternity waiting for or order to be prepared, my now starving family was brought a single plate of egg rolls, later to be followed by another single plate of pot stickers. At this point we are beginning to see how we are to expect dinner plate by plate rather than in one complete order. This went on through out the remainder of our dinner, to include the waitress forgetting an entire item we had ordered only to laugh it off and blame it on her ink pen. Yes. You read right. Her. Ink. Pen. n nThe food was no where near as good as it's predecessor on Cactus and I 17, and the wait staff left a great deal to be desired. n nA few bones found in the sweet and sour pork, dirty stem ware, my wife tripping over a hole in the floor near our table and we FINALLY receive the check and concluded we won't be revisiting that location any time soon. n nThe ONLY thing pleasing about this experience was the 15 coupon found on their website.",1
"We were amazed and so disappointed with the presentation of our meals. When a place is so damn expensive, there is no excuse for bad presentation. We had escargot to stArt, which was suppose to be mushroom stuffed in puff pastry. Instead, it was a snail, a mushroom on top and an oversized piece of stale coin like puff pastry placed on top.all floating in a watered down herb butter.Yuck! nThe atrocity didn't end there. My ribeye was delicious, but it came with nothing! I paid nearly 55 for my steak and had to order sides EXTRA! Hubby had the salmon, ridiculous also came with barely anything. 4 asparagus tips.over cooked and bland. Wine was reasonable. Baked potato was 9 and underdone. Will never go back. I'm not usually so hard on a place but when you pay big bucks for a meal, it should be of a certain standard, especially in a place like Vegas! Service was good, waiter was a hopeless romantic and kept giving us one liners like ""I know love when I see it, and I see it in you too "" . Oh please. Too much cheese lol!",1
"TWENTY STARS! An International Treasure! n nThis is one of the most amazing collections that I've ever seen. nPlan on spending several hours here. I spent three, and it wasn't enough. n nLaid out by country and culture. You wander freely from one display to the next, as your wireless headphones included with the admission track where you are, and seamlessly sync up with each audio video presentation. n nAt most of the displays, you'll see two or more examples of videoed performances from that region. You'll see how some of these rare and unusual instruments are played as the beauty and diversity of the songs and sounds of the world wash over you. n nThis is not about celebrity.You will not see Jimi Hendrix's guitar or Patsy Cline's microphone though, at the moment, they do have the piano on which John Lennon composed ""Imagine "" . n nFor anyone interested in music, world history, culture, or the performing arts, this is a world class, must see experience. Don't miss it.",2
"My friend won big at the casino today. and so she took us to dinner.hooray! This place is expensive. like almost Vegas expensive BUT it was better than the majority of the Vegas buffets. and I have done some serious buffeting. They had american kobe steaks that were tender and delicious. Creamy mashed potatoes. Tender broccolini. Wonton soup that is actually good fairly rare for a buffet . Really good garlic bread. And to top it off. A fancy cheese, meat, and fig display. The only thing that was not awesome was the lamb leg.but it still wasn't bad. The dessert set up was pretty awesome. fresh fruit, all different types of pies, tarts, cakes, ice cream, sorbet, and even fresh made bananas foster. I ate so much dessert. It was sick. They had some delicious chocolate mousse, tarts, and the bananas foster was excellent. I am so glad we gave this place a try and I would definitely come back for another special occasion. n nThis buffet does a very good job of making you feel like you are in a nice restaurant and not necessarily a buffet. The buffet is separated from the dining room and there is very attentive service bringing drinks all non alcoholic drinks included and clearing plates. Gotta like that. Plus we had a view of the pool. not such a bad view.",2

"I am updating my review by dropping from 4 stars to 2 stars after my second meal at Spoonhouse. This time I had the Bi Bim Bap in hot stone bowl. I am forced to compare it to the same dish served at Ai Ri Rang or B Won, both of which are much better. n nAt Spoonhouse the proportion of white rice was much higher, with less meat and veggies. The stone bowl was not as hot and therefore the rice didn't scorch the way it should, and the final insult was that the Srirachi sauce was served in squirters labeled ""Bi Bim Bap sauce hot "". It would be as if McDonald's labeled their ketchup ""hamburger sauce "", assuming the customers had no idea what the food was like or how to use the sauce. nLastly, the reference to burritos, tacos and quesadillas is offensive. It's Korean food. It doesn't need Mexican names to be understood.",1

"Stopped in twice during our recent trip to Vegas based upon Yelp reviews and a desire to find Boars Head meat to take back home to California. Had a couple of very tasty sandwiches on the first visit. All Boars Head meats, cheese and a homemade dressing to complete a great sandwich n nBased on the reviews we picked up some gourmet and BBQ burgers that weighed in about 8 oz pre cooked. Figured we might like the gourmet better than the BBQ but the BBQ gets rave reviews. The day we got home we fired up the grill and wow.we found out why those BBQ burgers are raved about.they are or make the best burger I have ever personally made on a grill in my life. The next day we had the gourmet burgers and if not for the BBQ burgers the day before they would possibly be one of the best burgers I had ever made. They were good, very good, excellent, but the BBQ burgers are just perfect. We feared they were simply regular burger meat with BBQ sauce.never fear.they are perfectly seasoned and perfectly ground. n nWe also picked up some filets, chorizo and pollo as well. The Filets are perfect. The prices are reasonable and we did not get the prime though we were tempted. They had shrimp that could pass for lobster tail, I would put it at perhaps 8 10 count truly the largest I have seen outside of fine dining. n nThe owner was very helpful. A former chef at one of the major casino steak houses. He even shrink wrapped our meat for the long trip to Cali. This is a new ""don't miss "" for our bi monthly trips to Vegas.",2

"Do NOT waste your time or money here. Went to the T Bone with a large party. Food was mediocre at best. Items like potatoes and corn need to be ordered al la carte. Once you ordered, they tell you to help yourself to the salad bar, which obviously came from a bag iceberg lettuce mainly that they threw into a bowl. they had some sliced up cucumbers and tomatoes. That was the ""salad bar "". Next came the Texas toast and beans. The bread was just a loaf of bread that you but in the supermarket. The beans also appeared to have come in a large can and had very little flavor. All of the food was cafeteria quality at best. Meals were served sporadically. The second to last meal came out well after everyone was finished eating and the last meal never did come out. The person that ordered it said she didn't want it anymore. nThe server was rude and when asked to speak with the manager, Kevin was less that helpful. Our party had a total of 5 meals that were not prepared correctly and one meal went back three times. The manager never offered up any compensation for four of the incorrect meals, not even a free dessert. Only one meal was comped. the one that was never received. nWe did request some separate checks and when we finally got the checks, we asked to speak with Kevin again and he didn't even bother to come out. Tip was already added to each check. Some of us were charged for drinks that were already purchased at the bar prior to ordering. If you still decide to dine here and pay in cash. pay attention to your change! The server actually shorted one diner 12 dollars change on the bill, the server was then heard complaining to that manager about the group calling us an ungrateful bunch. Pretty shameful behavior considering we were very patient and spend better that 500 dollars to the T Bone. nI am hoping that T Bone Steakhouse actually READS these reviews and takes them seriously. I have read quite a few of these reviews you need to sort by date to get the most recent and MANY of them are not from happy campers.",1

"I'm not really a connoisseur of Japaense food, but I do have taste buds, and you better believe that they don't lie. I had a great time dining at Ramen Bar.

I had the ajo Ramen which was flavorful and spicy hot in the way I like it. Sriracha sauce came out promptly as I pre emptively asked for, which automatically deserves an extra star in my book. n nService can improve a bit, though.

"A while back I got a chance to meet Chef Payton Curry and try his cuisine at Welcome Diner his short lived concept in Downtown Phoenix, incorporating planned obsolescence. Post Welcome Diner, Curry could be found making guest chef appearances at various restaurants around town as well as throwing ""Guerrilla dinners "" with his merry bunch of culinary misfits. Over the past few months Curry has been keeping his culinary skills sharp in the kitchen of Chef Charlene Badman at Scottsdale hot spot FnB. n nFast forward to Today and the first service at Curry's newest venture, Brat Haus. Nestled in the space formerly occupied by Oregano's Pizza, Brat Haus is spread out among two buildings with a ""climate controlled "" outdoor patio. The 360 degree mister was a nice touch and quite refreshing on a hot day but I don't know if I would go as far as agreeing with our hostess that the patio is climate controlled n nFirst up from the Haus, a stone hearth pretzel I have been drooling over on Facebook for the past week. This rustic pretzel, served with grainy Haus mustard, is just what I had been hoping it would be so much for maintaining objectivity . A combination of hard and chewy, kissed with the perfect amount of salt, the Haus pretzel does not disappoint. If I hear of anyone asking for cheese sauce to dip one of these happy little twists in, I may cry . n nI've eaten my fair share of Bratwurst including a few while in Germany which were pretty memorable but over all, i've just never eaten one and exclaimed ""DAMN! that's delicious. "" Well, I can no longer make that statement as the Spicy brat 5.75 topped with my choices of spicy peppers of course and root beer onions nestled in a chewy french roll just plain rocked. Juicy, flavorful and possessed of the perfect meaty texture, the traditional spicy brat is a winner. there will be many more of these in my future n nAccompanying my brat were thrice cooked belgian fries 4.50 Large . Lightly seasoned frites, crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside as they should be, served with choice of dipping sauces in this case truffle aioli and Sriracha Aioli , the Hause fries are not only a perfect companion to a brat but a necessity in my humble opinion. n nLast but not least, the ubiquitous hamburgers, or are they? You will find a ""regular "" burger in the form of the Haus Favorite but that is where the ""norm "" ends. There is a brat burger i'd probably want for breakfast every morning consisting of a 1 3lb pork sausage patty topped with a fried egg and swiss cheese 6.75 and the 800 pound gorilla in the room, the ""Pig Mac. "" 7.25 n nWhat's this you say? The Pig Mac? Let me get this straight, Curry thinks it's a good idea to combine a 1 4lb pork sausage patty with a 1 4lb ground beef patty topped with caramelized onions, bound with something called ""Hush Hush sauce? "" Well it's a good gawddamned thing Curry has the twisted mind he does because there are few things pork can't make better and apparently a juicy, well seasoned hamburger is one of them. I don't know why I haven't thought of doing this before but it works. This mingling of textures and flavors going on here is like the crossing of the proton streams in Ghostbusters except I didn't end up with marshmallow goo on my face. I must say, I would have rather had a traditional spicy brat split and perched atop my burger a bit more as I preferred its texture and spiciness to the patty but again, this is a winner. n nIt's about time someone broke the mold and opened a restaurant that didn't fall into line with the current trend of cookie cutter concepts, frozen yogurt, cupcake shops and gourmet burger joints come immediately to mind. Curry and his Brat Haus have brought something simple, fresh and different to the Scottsdale culinary scene. I'm sure others will follow in short order .",2
"I love this place! Anytime I'm in Scottsdale, I have to stop here! You never know what beautiful items they have, since it's ever changing! Next time I'm in the market for furniture this will be my first stop! Great prices, of course the longer they have something, the lower the price and great staff!",2
"Why is everyone else writing their reviews on the listing on Hanna? Wrong address peeps! nSo I had been wanting to eat here for a while, but everytime I come to Westgate it was to meet friends at one of the big restaurants there. nSo I came here today on my own for lunch. It was pretty easy to figure out how to order you pick a bag by number that corresponds to the category number on the menu then you choose your toppings nI got the Ruben with provolone and thousand island and I substituted the sauerkraut for coleslaw and it came toasted. I also ordered the house chips which are homemade potato chips with salt and pepper. nSo I got my sandwich and was surprised at how small it was. It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to. So I ignored the size and dove in. WOW! The bread was so good. Toasted without being dry, light. The meat was perfectly cooked, not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place, the coleslaw was so good and flavorful, juicy without dripping all over the place. The chips were also really good! Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size. It was so good I can't wait to go back!",2
"My family and I ventured in to Battistas last week for dinner, and as with all my other visits to the restaurant over the last 20 years, had a pleasant dining experience. The food is good and the atmosphere is unique with its days gone by feel. Gordo I think that's his name , the accordion player, has been there on every visit. It's probably not the best Italian food in the area, but it's a good break from all the over the top casino restaurants that churn the around the strip.",2
